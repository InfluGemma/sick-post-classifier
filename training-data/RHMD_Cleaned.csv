"What can you legally do when you turn 18 in the U.S.? I know this has been asked a lot, but I keep seeing the same answers. What I know so far is that you can donate blood, get a tattoo, buy a lottery ticket, write your will, buy spray paint, become ordained, carry a concealed knife after sunset, pawn an item in a pawnshop, become a notary public, buy cough drops, request a copy of your medical records, bet on horses, and buy a lighter (it's not illegal, but many shops won't sell it to you unless you're 18).

So, what are some different activities you can legally do on your birthday?

(Some other things I know: buy fireworks, walk into an adult establishment, vote, watch rated r movies, serve alcohol, invest, own a credit card, sue, adopt, get married, jury duty, and a few others that I can't remember at the moment)",1

Is it even worth being annoyed by? What would you do? ",1
"Is it weird for me to sneeze/cough in my shirt? I hate using my arm/hand/fist when sneezing/coughing, since 
a] I use them all the time (especially my hands) and thus I would transmit my germs into other objects
b] There is always a chance (especially with the inside of my elbow) that I don't catch all of the germs and they go flying out.
My solution was to sneeze down into my shirt, since I never take off my shirt anyways and it would catch all of the germs I extrude.

"My Dad's coughing is excessivly loud Can't help but notice he practically shouts when he coughs, it's somewhere between funny and annoying, can't decide.

I want to cough and sneeze in public without people panicking. I want to hear people coughing and sneezing and only be concerned with how gross it is, instead of how deadly it could potentially be. I want to hug my friends again. I want to not be angry with my spouse for never wearing a mask. I want normal back.",1

I felt bad for him ,then he apologized for sneezing. In these trying times, I realize that if someone cough or sneeze , our mind is gonna think one thing right now : Coronavirus. 

I have terrible spring allergies and I‚Äôd be terrified if I had to go get a few groceries and felt a sneeze coming on, not to mention a causal cough to clear my throat if needed.

"I been seeing clear shields at stores and I think it‚Äôs a great idea.

However, the hospital I work at will only issue quarantine orders for someone who has come into contact with a COVID positive patient AND has flue like symptoms fever, cough, etc. etc. However, it seems like this virus can and has spread through asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, literature states it can take 2-14 days after coming into contact with the virus for symptoms to appear. So, what say you reddit?",1
"So... what's gonna happen to buffets? So when you go into a buffet, you kinda wince when you see someone cough/sneeze. No one really wants to see someone sneeze over the salad right? But what about now, and after all of this has settled?

"I'm trying to quit smoking... today is the first day! I've been smoking for about 8ish years. (Since I was 14/15) I wouldn't say I'm a heavy smoker. I'm about a half a pack (10 cigarettes) a day smoker. 

Anyway, I've finally decided to stop because I have had a cough/sinus gunk and shit nonstop for 4 months. I'm starting to get a little scared haha. 

My morning routine is wake up, make coffee, go outside, sip my coffee and smoke. Today, I waited about an hour after waking up before smoking vs the usual 10 mins & I only smoked half of one. This is way harder than I thought, but I think I got this! 

I've been sucking on spicy cinnamon candy to fight the urge and keep my mouth busy and I think I may get on the treadmill or go for a walk at the park I dunno. 

Anyone else quitting right now? Anyone that HAS quit what's your story and advice? I'm super excited to give this nasty ass habit up ",1

But I decided to teach myself ukelele. It‚Äôs relatively easy and I have no ambitions of being a musician; I only want to learn a new skill. I just spent an hour on my own plucking away and it felt really nice. It felt meditative and I suddenly didn‚Äôt fear being alone with myself.",1
My boss is making me disobey government guidelines I live in London.  The government just put the whole country on lockdown except for essential work and food shopping.  My work is not essential.

"I am sick, reddit  Second day of being sick, I can feel it spreading through my body. There's a build up of phlegm in my armpits, and I cannot squat without my knees coughing.

I woke up at 3pm today, if you can call it waking up, that is. I am still not sure if this is reality or some delirious state. I just keep wondering when the coffee will kick in, and why it tastes like onions.

But it's not all bad, I suppose. Perhaps the sickness is a good excuse to take a few days off work and relax. But how can I relax when I am sick and my knees are coughing? Perhaps the sickness is a good excuse to do some work.",1
"Fast food employees I have a question... Long-ish post. Tldr at the bottom. 

During these times where almost everywhere is closed yet fast food restaurants remain open, what are you seeing day to day at work? Are employees pissed they gotta work, relieved they are still getting paid / have a job and are employees that claim, ""not sick"" ie: slight cough, runny nose, etc... still show up to work? 

Only ask because roommate keeps ordering out, when I warn them about the risk involved right now. Lastly stay safe out there. Thanks if anyone responds.

Tldr: Is it safe, in your opinion to order fast food right now?",1

I know this isn‚Äôt always true but I‚Äôm in a good mood and just saw an example of it.

I tried to relax a little bit and take a nap, but I was heavily breathing. I had to clean toilet, that's for sure, but my mom STILL THINKS everything is alright. I tried to speak with her, but I got ignored. I feel bad as my mother seems not to care about me. Maybe she's in bad mood? I don't know.

Poland is in yellow zone (3k c0v1d positive tests/24 hours) since Saturday and I am not sure about walking in mask for whole day with such diseases.


I do not want to vomit in school or cough, because C0V1D and I don't want my family closed in quarantine. How can I convince my mom to make her atleast worried a little bit?
Or should I say about it to my father?

One time, it was just me and my buddy after everyone left. We didn't get high yet so he asked if I could make him lean (it's basically cough syrup with codeine and sprite and food color.) I opened the fridge and there was two bottles of cough syrup, one with codeine and one without. Codeine was the thing that got you high. So I made mine with the good stuff but I used the cough syrup without codeine for my friend to see if he would act high.

After a while, we finished the drinks. I was a little drowsy but he was on another level. Trying to talk slowly with a rough voice and dropped his eyes low. He was like ""damn, that was some good lean, I got waay f*cked up."" and then he left and I was screaming and laughing so hard till my mom came home.",1

I am so thankful the experienced nurses had a trash can ready and I am so grateful I made it into the trash can. 

I felt embarrassed not only from vomiting but I felt like I was discouraging other already nervous patients about to donate blood. The nurses are always so sweet and I stayed for an hour until I was good to drive home. I don't want to donate or go through that ever again but since I have the universal donor blood type I feel obligated to. It would be selfish for me not to go through a little bit of pain for someone who may be suffering way more.

"I hate one of my best friends but am stuck being friends... [Light] I have recently come to the conclusion that one of closest friends who I have known all through high school isn't a good person and tbh, a bit of a prick. Therefore I don't enjoy hanging around with him anymore. However he likes to think of himself as the alpha male and for this reason I can't hang out with the rest of my friends without him being there. He isn't a horrible person as such but he lacks the basic traits of being a good which makes me not want to hang around with him. Plus he smokes all my weed without ever offering to cough up any cash.

The main reason I made this post was because he really pisses me off and I couldn't tell any friend without the risk that they would tell him.

They have stolen thousands of dollars just calling customer service filing for refunds.

It boggles my mind how Amazon doesn't have security measures against this. 

What really bothers me is how they get other people to cough up their accounts and credit cards so they can split the freebies for just being the middle men. 

It honestly just feels good to get this off my chest.",1
"[Remorse] Been doctor shopping after being ill I became addicted to opiates as a means to cope with issues that led to bigger issues that I am still paying for. I cut off opiates (many pain pills) cold turkey back in March. It was not that hard, I suppose. Probably because I got a good job and improved my life. I ended up getting the flu and then bronchitis. I have been coughing like crazy for four weeks. Went to urgent care for some antibiotics but was given codeine. Codeine was my gateway drug. I did not know the doctor gave me an RX for it because she spoke no English and called the drug a different name. Long story short, I went to two doctors a week later and got more bottles of codeine. My logic is get it while you can. I wanted to reach out to people but did not want a lecture. That would make me do it more. ",1

"Why does coughing cause a drop in MAP? I‚Äôm a medical student currently volunteering as a bedside nurse in ICU. Whenever a patient isn‚Äôt fully sedated and I attempt to suction the trach (SG or below the epiglottis), their MAP drops by 15-20 which is concerning since it‚Äôs around 60 to begin with. 

What‚Äôs the mechanism by which this happens? Does a cough increase intrathoracic pressure and reduce venous return to the heart, thereby reducing CO transiently? I haven‚Äôt been able to find much on this, presumably because coughing in a healthy person doesn‚Äôt bring about a clinically important change in MAP.

Also, if anyone has experience with these patients, how significant would the drop in MAP need to be for me to get worried? I‚Äôm scared of SG aspiration unsupervised now because of how their cough reflex will trigger a fall in BP and the ECMO/Vitals monitor to start beeping like crazy. But I also want to be able to provide this care confidently.

I had a patient ask me when she can end isolation to see her boyfriend. She is 20 days out from initial symptoms and was never hospitalized. She still.

With such a small group (and nearly all one of two working parents of small or school-age children), it‚Äôs very difficult to find last-minute coverage. Unless someone is super sick, they have no choice but to come to work symptomatic. It‚Äôs one thing when it‚Äôs a regular cold at even the flu, but there‚Äôs so much additional risk with Covid. We have no private space, so there‚Äôs no way to not put your coworkers at risk. And I can‚Äôt really imagine wearing an N95 for a 13 hour shift while you‚Äôre congested and coughing.

"I'd like to know if this is something to be worried about. To give some context I'm an 18 year old guy and have been a loner my entire life. By that I mean that I had absolutely zero friends/girlfriends my whole life and even though I havr an ok relationship with my family I usually don't talk to them unless necessary. Basically this causes me to only say at most 30-50 words a week. Due to this my social skills are horrendous, but it gets worse since I end up stuttering quite a bit sometimes in the middle of saying a word I become physically incapable of finishing said word causing to just fake cough so I don't look any weirder.
Anyway because of this I have become very self conscious when I end up talking to someone and once I'm about to go to sleep I end crying myself to sleep because of how much I embarrassed myself in public. I'm even worried that people think I'm mentally retarded when I'm actually not.",1

"Sick of my parents' shit Just yesterday, my mom demanded I ""voluntarily"" cough up 200 euros just because my older sister did a few months back - she thought this was the most normal thing in the world. I refused on the basis that this skewed definition of ""voluntary"" doesn't sit well with me.

Just an hour ago I was told that I had to leave within 3 months time, that she wouldn't want anything to do with me anymore.

I've grown used to the fact that my mom doesn't listen to what I have to say and just pushes me away whenever I don't act according to her image but this is a new low. To sketch the situation I'm in: I'm a heart patient with half of my capacity cut off, unemployed and a second lockdown seems to be on its way shortly since the government is putting on stricter limitations.

Most of the time he would groan really loudly, walk loudly, close cabinets, doors loudly, etc. Those noises would keep me and my mom up at night and I obviously they made really scared, especially the groaning noises. 

But this year my dad quit drinking and he isn't as loud as he used to be, but from time to time he will cough or groan, or sneeze or make any other human noise, maybe close cabinet loud on accident or jokingly make some weird noise and those noises will freak me out, they would make me anxious it feels like my body goes into flight or fight mode and I don't know what to do.

"Anxiety and false symptoms? So I'm not always the best at wording my thoughts so please bear with me. As you can probably tell from the title I am one of the many with anxiety, generally I have it pretty under control, but these last few weeks have been trying to say the least. I am in a part of canada with a really low count of Covid-19 but seeing the reports and all the news has been slowly grinding me down. At the end if last week I found myself with a slight sore throat and cough, and that has caused my anxiety to rise back up. This causes my breathing to be a little shorter alot of the time. I'm without a fever or anything like that so I havent gone to get tested yet, I was just wondering if it's possible for my anxiety to give me some pseudo symptoms after reading so much about it?

"Help to diagnosis: Specific Activities Leading to Physical Symptoms Hi,  
I suffer from some specific physical symptoms (coughing, diarrhea) and impaired cognitive function after doing some specific activities e.g. computer programming, studying specific subjects (e.g. advanced math) and hard physical activities.  
I haven't been able to put a diagnosis to this link between activities and symptoms, and thereby not been able to recover. **I hope for your help to point me in a direction to find a diagnosis or an effective recovering strategy/method.**

I started having these symptoms during my time at the university. They were intensified during my (stressful) final thesis (constant diarrhea and coughing leading to daily vomiting).  
It is now four years since I graduated. The symptoms have slightly eased, primarily because I avoid the activities that trigger the symptoms. This also means that I avoid specific activities that I used to love, which is unfulfilling.

Thanks in advance, M.",1
"I've ""attempted"" multiple times today but the feeling is so awful that I don't follow through I'm not doing so good. I can't even tell how serious I am. I've sort of tried hanging by partial suspension but that feeling when my air is cut off and I immediately want to cough, which makes me gag, forces me out of it. I think I would rather something instantaneous so that I can't change my mind. But I don't have anything like that. 

I asked my mother to take me to the CSU (crisis stabilization unit) and then she saw me and angrily asked, ""Do you want me to take you to the CSU now?"" I don't think they take anything I say seriously anymore. She didn't ask me any questions. I must be a bother she eagerly wants to get rid of.

What's unusual about this is that I don't seem to have much control over it.

"I’m going to continue wearing masks post pandemic Not only has this allowed me to have my first hay fever free year, also 2020 was the first year that I didn’t get sick at all. Health benefits aside, it would be nice not to Have your movements recorded with facial recognition cameras. And not being judged for not smiling all the time. 

I do hope no company or department will be able to force you not to wear one.",1
I really want to have a baby and I have baby fever. Does anyone else want to have kids but you know you want to be more ready with a house and a steady job? I just want to be a mom so bad and I see everyone around me having babies and I'm just here. Barely progressing. Trying to get back to school. Ugh. And I would never get pregnant without my partners consent. We talked about waiting a couple years. Blah someone talk to me.,0
"Holidays make me want babies, ugh toddlers opening presents is my favorite freaking thing. I'm young, and definitely don't want any kiddos yet, but oh man are babies cute. I know all about the not cute moments but I really think me and my partner would be good parents. I seriously cannot wait to have a baby to buy presents for and snuggle and cook with. 

So tell me your cute kiddo Christmas stories? Was the present you bought a hit?? Favorite memory from the last week or so? 

Also anyone else with baby fever?",0
"I wish I was a kid again & could have just one more sick day home from school That was seriously the best. On a sick day Id get to stay home from school, so my parents would let me lay in their bed all day and watch cartoons. My mom would stop home on her lunch break to check in on me and make me soup and bring me ginger ale and then tuck me in before she left again. Staying home from work sick as an adult is awful. The whole time you’re stressed about the work you’re missing and if your boss is going to be mad at you or even fire you even if you’re throwing up with a fever and are also worried if you can even financially afford the day off. To be a kid again... it was like the only day where you’d just get to relax and be cared for and loved.",1
"I got into Dungeons and Dragons for the first time and it's AMAZING I've always been a fan of fantasy RP when I was younger, but due to the unpopularity of such things in my middle/high school (with it being too nerdy) and the lack of people I know IRL who are interested in it, I never got to experience it back then.

Lately with COVID and how the world is now, my friend on Discord was able to set up a campaign with the latest Frostmaiden expansion out and already being two games in so far I'm having an absolute blast. We just finished wrapping up our adventure today and just with how cooperative everyone's been and how much planning we all do it might start to throw a wrench in what our DM wants to do (in a good way).

"New-age Aquaman feels like a fever dream. Just watched the movie and to try and describe some of the things in it feels like a something you might hear from [Stefon on SNL weekend update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctoAyRDtzU). 

I've seen some of DC's animated things like the Flashpoint Paradox and Aquaman/Atlantis is pretty much equally as fucking crazy, but it's just so much easier to not even stop to think about in animated form vs in the live action movie. 

I don't even think it's a bad thing either. The movie was fun and enjoyable.  ",0
"This year feels like a dream/nightmare IDK but a lot of things happened this year. It was like if you told me some or most of the things that are gonna happen this year like last year or 2 years ago i would have thought it was a fever dream.

Over this year i notice that sometimes i will legit be staring at my phone and have the urge to cry. This happens like randomly. IDK if these feels are cause of this fever dream of a year. Let's hope next year will be better.

"Does anyone else have a fever dream like experience when they see/hear things that happened when you were 0-4 years old? For me personally, hearing some of the music released in the late 90s/early 00s gives me this eerie feeling. I was physically there, and at some point had a lot of memories of the time but these are now mostly lost to me. But when I hear this music, even music that I didn't know until recently, something about it takes me back. Sort of in a nostalgic way, but more like an imagined past haunting me. Does anyone else get this, maybe for a different era?

Here's some examples of the music I'm talking about

"Hot date tonight! Have had a six months wait list for this, the sun is finally shining, we are finally able to go out to Resturante de la Balcony!

"Anyone else tired? I find myself being always tired recently. Struggling to stay awake at multiple points during the day, needing a 2nd or 3rd cup of coffee to make it through a work day, just plain tired.

Anyone else feel like this?",1
"Although the whole COVID-19 quarantine situation sucks... Does anybody else find it relieving not to be pressured by social expectations of other people?

I've learnt that I'm quite the introvert and I spend all day at home on a regular basis despite the whole situation. Usually people find it strange how I can spend weeks at a time without seeing anybody, so now it's slightly amusing me that everyone else is (though it's forced) doing it too.

Personally, it feels like a big weight has been lifted off of my shoulders because I'm not expected to meet up with and talk to people constantly due to the fact that no one is essentially allowed to leave their house. I feel like I can be myself now without being judged for my lack of a social life. Does anyone else feel this way? I know that some people are going crazy with cabin fever and I understand that perfectly, but how do you think it's affecting your social life?",1
"How’s everyone else’s morning/day/night? Hello, I woke up this morning with a low grade headache (not hangover and hopefully not fever) and it’s since become medium grade with a lovely added bonus of wanting to do absolutely nothing. The only problem is that I have to start a project due in 5 days. It’s a five minute presentation on a piece of music I have to start it now because I’m a master of procrastination and if I don’t come back to it until the night before, at least I’ll have something to work with. 

I’m laying in bed, watching tv, only having done the title slide and half a bullet point. I’m gonna try and do a bit more then make myself some pasta. I’m making cupcakes tomorrow. 

The headache a likely from sleeping in too long or PMS. I’ll hydrate and hope it goes awa-ow.",1

"Using my quarantine to get into Radio Head During the initial quarantine I took it really hard. I wasn’t able to go to the gym, see my friends, and I felt some intense cabin fever. Over the past three days or so I’ve increasingly turned toward music and finally gave Radio Head the appreciation they deserve! 
I started with Kid A. Damn! So good! “How to disappear completel,” was beautiful and chilling at the same time. The album is great from front to back. Now I’m getting into In Rainbows and I like it even more! “All I need” and “15 step” are some personal favorites. Music is a beautiful thing and I’m so grateful I’ve had it to turn to not only now, but during any difficult time in my life.

Feel free to share favorite albums or tracks. Stay safe..",1
"How far do you think we should be taking quarantine measures? I have seen numerous new articles that state whoever has come Into contact with a COVID positve patient should be quarantined as well. However, the hospital I work at will only issue quarantine orders for someone who has come into contact with a COVID positive patient AND has flue like symptoms fever, cough, etc. etc. However, it seems like this virus can and has spread through asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, literature states it can take 2-14 days after coming into contact with the virus for symptoms to appear. So, what say you reddit?",1
"I can't wait to have pet rats! You know how people have baby fever? And when they see cute pictures or videos of babies they'll tag their SOs or best friends or something and get all excited about having one someday? I'm currently the same way but with pet rats. I've always wanted to have a pair, but in the same sorta distant way that I wanted a dog or a cat or a secondary degree someday. But I'm finally about to move into my first *real* apartment, and the options I'm looking at all allow pets. Taking care of rats would fall under my budget.

Recently I went to a newer friend's place and met their pet rat and I absolutely fell in *love*. It hung out on my shoulder and snuggled in my hair and didn't want to leave. I can't stop thinking about rats ever since, and I can't talk to my friends about it because I've already gushed enough about rats that I don't want them to get sick of me.",0
Getting close on finding a surrogate for our 4th child. (Casual) Me and my husband (we are gay) cannot naturally conceive cause we are both dudes.

"What’s good, Reddit? So a whole lot of things suck right now. I haven’t seen my immediate family in over a month due to quarantine. I’m lucky enough to be an essential worker at a grocery store and still have my job, but every day I’m at work I am anxious of encountering or contracting covid-19. I can’t do the thing I’m most passionate about (rock climbing) because all the gyms are closed, and all my local climbing spots are too full of people to be socially responsible. I’m wasting away my days playing animal crossing and lazing around with my SO at home. 

I’m grateful to have a few things to do at home, but the cabin fever is finally beginning to set in. What have you been doing to keep sane?",1
"How long do you think you truly appreciate that feeling of not feeling sick after you've been sick? They say you don't really appreciate how good it feels to not be sick until you're sick which I think is a universal truth, but I'm curious about why that is. When you're sick and you get better, you can appreciate the ability to breathe smoothly through both nostrils and not feel that sore lump in your throat, you appreciate not feeling a headache and fever, but how long does that typically last for you? A couple days? A day? Hours? Minutes? It's not something we're really conscious of but that's the whole point, do we really need to get sick to be reminded of how good we have it feeling nothing? It's weird to me how life works like that. It's nice to feel nothing after you're sick, but you can't just suck on lemons all day to appreciate the taste of nothing. Or can you? How do you keep feeling appreciative of the times when you're just not feeling pain?",1

My wife left on our bike trip without me. We are training for the AIDS LifeCycle next year and were supposed to leave super early this morning to ride a 30 mile in Berkeley with our friend. It was going to be my first ""long"" ride. 

She wanted to give my bike a tune-up ahead of time, but she's been busy and hasn't had time to look at it until 11:30 last night. Well, something went wrong with the derailer and now I can't ride it at all. She feels awful. I'm upset, but what can you do? It's just a crappy situation. I told her to go have fun with our friend and not worry about it. We can go on a ride together another time.

To top it off, I left my job recently and have been stuck at home for the past week looking after our injured puppy. She's really cute but now we're both suffering from cabin fever! Call the whambulance!",1

There are two examples we have been digging through the litureature to find a source but to no avail.  Talking to colleges in Norway, they found these to exist in the USA as well.  Two of our best examples are: ""SSRIs, you have to keep trying different ones with patients until one works"" and ""starve a cold and feed a fever.""  To be fair, we have heard the latter more often from nurses.

Is this commonplace knowledge in the USA?  Are there other ""folklore"" cures like this (Apologies for naming, not sure how to best describe in English).",1

The guy listened to me and my concerns.  Told me the old ""You're in an old package blah blah blah."" He reworked some things and saved me $10 dollars a month.  I said thank you and be safe.  He said,  ""Hold on a minute.  It's covid. You're nice.  I've not had anyone treat me so nice in a month. I'm giving you $50 just for being nice and not giving me a headache. "" Nice. It's sad that being nice is an unusual thing now.

So where does that put diagnosis for SAH beyond a 6 hr interval, if CT has good but not great sensitivity (80~%) and then LP of around ~60%. Is it just a hope that if CT comes back negative that the LP picks up the SAH that is present in that one  case ?

"Sobriety is a terrible thing. [Remorse]

When I'm drunk, I love it.  Everything is perfect and fun and nothing hurts.  I write better, shoot better in FPS games, get along better with people, and I'm just much happier and carefree when drunk.

Then I sober up, can't sleep, and have a hangover in the morning and feel miserable for a few days.

Then that passes, I feel decent again, and I want a drink, because...

Then everything is fine again and nothing hurts.

And again and again and again.

Why can't I just stay drunk?

I feel like society and people's condemnation of being eternally drunk is wrong if I'm forced to be sober.  Sobriety is just a blank, cold, empty void between periods of being drunk.

Damn you for making me feel bad for having to choose sobriety.  Damn me for caring what you think, too.

"Fellowship not reimbursing ""book fund"" Hi all,

I've graduated from a fellowship program, and it's been a headache getting reimbursed for my book fund (although other fellows got theirs).  I submitted paperwork almost 1.5 years ago, and the program ""owes"" me $3k total in book fund reimbursement.  I keep either getting the run around from the program administrator, and most recently literally got the ""check's in the mail"" message about 1 month ago.  Now I've gotten no response to any follow-up emails.

If I wasn't going to get reimbursed, I would have saved my $3k for other expenses.  Have any of you dealt with this or navigated this?  

Thanks!",0
"Medical plants of shame? I am a family doctor from Lithuania.
Lately here has been a huge increase in strange Russian products. One of them is umckaloabo plant extract. Which is not terrible on it's own, but the fact that is advertised as a ""natural antibiotic"" gives me a headache :D Now, every other time, when I decide to prescribe antibiotics I am asked ""can't we just use that extract? Won't it be much safier? We do not whant your pig pharma drugs"". 
And no mater what I do, I can't argue with the propaganda machine.

So I've decided to plant the actual plant in my office (we can have plants at most workplaces) and put a pair of google eyes on each leaf everytime anybody asks ""what about that extract"". It's much more fun to explain to the patient what antibiotics actually are and the kids seem to like it, too.

And what about you?
Do you have any plants in your ""black list""? :)",0
"Nursing home experience My partner is interested in picking up some nursing home patients, eventually we would have a third so we would alternate every third month.  The clinic is closed on Thursday afternoons so on my month I could run over after lunch and see 5-6 each week and that should keep me caught up.  My concern is the amount of calls from the facility & liability.  Right now with just two patients we get a few calls a week, I'm guessing with 25-30 it would get ridiculous.  

Anyone have experience in this situation?  Is the headache worth the extra revenue?  Right now I'm happy with m-f and occasional shift on weekends at urgent care clinic ",0
"Is allowing a fistula tract to form before repairing an intra-abdominal perforation acceptable practice? I posted this question to /r/surgery without a reply.  Let's see if there are takers here.

---

I seek guidance from the esteemed surgeons of this subreddit regarding this question. I've recently seen several cases where a patient developed a perforation of a hollow viscus in the abdomen. Instead of immediately taking the patient to the OR to repair it, it was allowed to continue until it formed a fistula tract, such as to the skin or perhaps another hollow organ, such as the bladder or vagina, and only then would exploration commence. Meanwhile, the patient would rage with sepsis, often for weeks on end, causing no end of headache to my service (critical care). Is this an acceptable practice for hollow viscus perforations/leaks, and so, under what circumstances is this the preferred surgical strategy, as opposed to immediate repair?",0

"Non-sad song suggestions? Hello all! Recently I've fallen into a rut of listing to music that makes me kind of sad. I want to get back into listening to uplifting stuff but I mostly get my music from specific artists or Grey's Anatomy (which has notoriously sad music) so I'm not sure where to start. 

I like Lana Del Rey, Declan McKenna (particularly his first album), Penelope Scott, Anna Nalick's Wreck of the Day Album, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift. Mostly I list stuff that I can sing to, and where the vocals aren't covered up by a bunch of instrumentals. I get headaches pretty easily too.

"Feelings of Nervousness I am seeking some guidance, because our dear old friend Google has not helped me at all.

The only thing I can think of is just the general state of the world with COVID. 

Is there anyone with a clue as to what this might be? Are there versions of anxiety disorders, where it's just nervousness? Does anyone know of any physical medical ailments that cause just nervousness.
