"Hi all!

So, my fiancé and I are wanting to buy this house in broad ripple. The only issue is that it is located in an AE flood zone /:  we got quoted $4000 for the flood insurance and this just seems so high. We apparently can’t add flood insurance to our home insurance. It has to go through FEMA. We were also told that because it’s the government, that 4000 isn’t something we can pay monthly. We have to pay it upfront each year. 

So my questions are, is this normal? Do you pay something similar or less? What insurance agency did you contact (we talked to homesite insurance)? And do you have any advice?

"Hello All,

I am looking for someone who is from a different cultural background here in Portland that would allow me to ask them a few questions for an assignment in my communications class. It would not take long, maybe 20-30 minutes at most. I will post the directions here...

&#x200B;

 

Kory Floyd (2011) discusses many dimensions by which cultures vary:  

**Individualism vs. Collectivism** (cultures vary in terms of their emphasis on individuals versus groups, or the ""collective whole"" in their societies)

**Low- vs. High-context** (the extent to which cultures rely on contextual cues to determine the meaning of communication behaviors)

**Low vs. High-Power** (the degree to which power, money, education, age, experience, and/or other valued characteristics is evenly distributed amongst people in a society)

**Masculine vs. Feminism** (the degree to which cultures cherish traditional masculine or feminine values)

**Monochronic vs. Polychronic** (cultures vary in terms of how they view the concept of time)

**Uncertainty Avoidance** (cultures vary in terms of how they embrace or reject uncertainty- i.e., cultures lie on a spectrum where one end represents the need to preserve the status quo, while the other end represents willingness to embrace change)

1. Interview a friend or acquaintance from a different cultural background to describe his/her culture, in terms of how these dimensions represent it.  
2. Explain, specifically, the culture your interviewee identifies with.
3. Ask the person you interview how they view American cultural values.  How do they see these US values in relation to their own personal values?  How has this affected a communication event in their lives

IF INTERESTED message me. Thank you."|Portland|2018|False|0

"As far as I can tell, most other states and countries do. Are we going to find ourselves behind the ball here? Trading them appears to be banned via an archaic law that has nothing to do with digital currency itself. All the candidates talk about expanding our economy and catching up with the rest of the country yet here we are on the verge of the explosion of a potential new currency and we can't even buy it or use it like the rest of the country.

*To be clear, I'm talking about Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Also, I happened to be in contact with Barasso's office on another matter, so I just let the woman I was talking to know about this. But I think it needs to be an issue with our state congress and governor more so then our federal representatives since they can change the law."|wyoming|2017|False|0

"I'm looking for a new set of modest-priced speakers and just can't convince myself to drop nearly $300 on something I haven't heard in person.

Fry's seems to have a hard time with the discounted speakers never being in stock, and even if they were, half the time they won't have an example hooked up in the listening room.

I tried the Best Buy in Fiesta Mall and they didn't have anything resembling a listening setup.

The guy in old-town Gilbert with the vintage stuff seemed okay, but speakers seem to be one of the few parts of audio where decent new kit seems to be reliably better than quality old kit.

Seems like most shops that specialize in audio gear are mostly interested in car audio, or at the sort of places that are so expensive that my budget wouldn't even cover the cost of the first consultation in a 29-step process that results in sourcing artisan amplifiers from Zanzibar and homeopathic cables for several hundred dollars per metre."|phoenix|2016|False|0

"Not sure if my fellow Georgians are aware, but Camden County, on the coast just north of Jacksonville, has been planning a ""commercial Spaceport"" for years now.  Any news you read about it is usually some glowing fluff piece, but NOTHING is going on.  The County has already been robbed of millions of dollars and absolutely nothing has happened.  I live about 6 miles from the test site on Harriet's Bluff.  Not a thing is happening there.  The site proposed is the former site of Tiokol, where one of the largest accidental plant explosions in American history occured when the magnesium manufacturing building caught fire.  At the time they were making flairs for the Vietnam War.  It was a disaster, and I know people whose relatives died.  Some residents still get sick with magnesium poisoning to this day.  The ground is literally poison, the work needed to clean the area and make it usable and safe for such a project would require astronomical (pun intended) cost and resources.  Our congressman Buddy Carter has also recently ""purchased"" about 350 acres near the site for next to nothing.  The County board of commissioners openly admit they are accountable to no one.  And despite being public land, you can be shot trying to enter.

The County, State, and Federal Government are literally robbing the tax payer, without even the courtesy of a plan of action, however fake it may be.  It's straight criminal and no legitimate news organization is looking into this.  If you or someone you know had the means or interest to help look into this and hold our elected officials accountable it would be greatly appreciated.  The people of Georgia deserve better.

TL;DR - Camden County government openly robbing the tax payers to such a blatant degree that even the most crooked of politicians would blush."|Georgia|2020|True|0

"Hello all you beautiful Melbournians!

Just reaching out before summer starts to see if anyone is keen to have some fun this summer playing Pub Cricket. I've played since my arrival in Melbourne 8 years ago and it is absolutely fantastic. 

YPCA - Yarra Pub Cricket Association is the competition. We have 12 pubs in and around the Yarra area each with a team. The competition has been running since the 80s and is as strong as ever.

It's super social - ages ranging from the young whipper snappers to the wise old veteran who once bowled 150 plus and scored 100 off of two overs (Definitely true)! Open to all genders. Open to all skill levels. It's really about having fun with good people on a Sunday. 

If you're keen, have a look on the website for more information. 

Alternatively, send me a message and I can give you more information. 

Have a wonderful day! And bring on a beautiful summer!!"|melbourne|2023|False|0

"Perhaps I don’t purchase stuff online much or I’m completely clueless about how the postal services work but the past two items I’ve ordered in the past month have taken such interesting routes to arrive to where I live. 

One example - I live in Noble Park for reference, I ordered something from the Good Guys. The package that was picked up from Essendon on the 24th of October and arrived at Melbourne Airport on the same day. The package was then scanned into a depot in Newcastle NSW on the 26th before returning back to Melbourne and being delivered on the 27th.

"As we all know we're in a major cost of living crisis, inflation, interest rates, rents, food, petrol, etc. 

Yet for a while all the GPs around me have started charging. $40+ gap in many places. Some of them started with new customers, but then they started charging everyone.

Coming from the UK, I find this truly bizarre and counterproductive. I can't comprehend having to pay to go to the GP. It means that if it's not very serious, I just won't go. Yet - I can afford it. It's just the principle. I'd rather Google the issue - which I know - is terrible!

But what about those for who $40 is just not possible? Who have to go without food so their kid can see a GP? I find this disgusting. 

The point of free healthcare is to catch serious issues sooner, and to prevent contagious diseases spreading as much. To protect the healthcare system from other pressure! Charging for it completely undermines this. 

What we are seeing is the healthcare system basically become useless overnight. The Victorian government supposedly cared so much about health yet now it suddenly doesn't matter a bit? Most of these GP clinics are laying off Doctors, and they are basically empty when you go in them now. 

And yesterday we also saw the closure of all the Respiratory clinics in the state. Overnight. Gone. 

Why is this happening? What's going on? What is everyone doing when they're sick? Is this a disaster in the making?"|melbourne|2023|True|0

"Hey everyone, just wanting to do a shout out to a super cute store in Richmond. It’s called PICTURE SEARCH!! 
I stumbled upon it the other week and wanted to share my experience. The front of the shop reminds me of something out of the Notting Hill movie, it’s so cute and quaint. Inside, there would be thousands of vinyl records, DVDs and VCRs, and behind the counter is the sweetest, kindest dude who owns the business - his name is Derek and he is so cool and intelligent and knowledgeable. 
He has sourced pretty much every movie that is hard to find and this is the last video hire store in Melbourne! Hashtag Nostalgia! He’s got an epic collection of vinyl records too. 
So hot foot it there and check it out. I hope he is really successful because he is so kind, he deserves it! Please share and spread the word.

"Does anyone know of a Reddit group of individuals that work in small businesses that do their company's IT/security in the Huntsville area? I realize there are bigger groups out there but I am trying to find ones that are here in Huntsville or close to it. I'm the only one at my small company (under 10 people) and I was hoping there were others out there in that situation. It doesn't have to be solo people but maybe just a few IT/sec people that work in small businesses. 

I was hoping to have a small community to share experiences or basic questions about security or best practices for a small environment in Huntsville. We can't really afford $3000 classes or expensive conferences. I would be more than willing to help anyone with their questions or direct them to resources that I've found.

"So I was just thinking of the wonders of light pollution we have in Wichita, and a thought occurred to me: Have one night where the city turns off all outside signs and all non-art lights. 

I don't know how practical this would be to get arranged, and how to go about it. There are probably also some technical issues with things light streetlights, and potentially requirements to keep lights on for streets or something. 

If that happened, I'm not certain, but it'd be likely that we could get it dark enough if we didn't have the lights to be able to see the milky way from inside the city. Apparently, it's not a unique idea: http://www.andrimagnason.com/cds-and-other-projects/lights-out-stars-on/ 

Plus it'd be cool to see the milky way behind the city landmarks with your own eyes (though that would mostly require it to be earlier in the year) or as an actual photo. Sure someone could do composites, but there are even people in Wichita who don't see it very often, even though it's a short drive away, if you live in the city. (To be fair, on really, really rare occasions, it can almost be made out within the light dome of Wichita) 

So, do you guys think this is something cool and practical, and if so, where would one start the discussion to see if it's feasible: The city council, public works division, police department, or? "|Wichita|2017|False|0

"tl;dr: Please PM me if you can pick up yogurt from two local health food stores and ship it refrigerated to Minnesota. I am more than happy to pay you for everything including your time.
----------
Today is my girlfriend's birthday. She has [ME/CFS](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html) (yes, it's quite real) and relies upon a large number of dietary restrictions, many of which have been learned by trial and error over the years, to reduce her symptoms. We live in Minnesota, and were supposed to be in Wichita over the weekend. She's been feeling really good lately, so neither of us expected any problems with the trip, but she unexpectedly crashed at the last minute and we weren't able to go. Early last week, I had planned an extra birthday surprise for her. I discovered that two health food stores in Wichita carry her favorite yogurt, which is made from sheep's milk, and is the only yogurt that she has proven to be able to eat without consequences. You can't buy it in Minnesota; we're well outside the distribution area. She's told me how much she misses it since she moved back up here from New Mexico, so I was pretty excited to find it in Wichita and thought it would be a fun birthday surprise to order a whole case for her. I called one of the stores and asked them to order a case, with the understanding that we'd be there to pick it up this weekend. They weren't 100% certain they'd be able to get it by the weekend, so I called a second store and ordered a case there too. Well, they both came in, so now there are two cases of yogurt sitting in Wichita that I ordered and promised to show up and pay for, and we're over 9 hours away. It's not really possible for either of us to collect in person (I have to work, she's still recovering), and we don't know anyone in town. I don't want to stick these stores with unpaid products that they ordered on good faith for me, and I want to still be able to give my girlfriend this weird (and now belated) birthday surprise. So, if there's anyone in town who is willing and able to pick the yogurt up, pack it appropriately in an insulated container with dry ice or gel packs, and ship it to Minnesota for me, please contact me directly and I'll fill you in on the details. I will cover all your expenses and pay you for your time."|Wichita|2017|False|0

NOAA’s most recent 3-4 week outlook discussion was short and brief.  I translated it from meteorological speak to English. 

They are expecting, based on model guidance, that a ridging pattern will dominate the 2 week period over the central and eastern US. With a trough over the NW. But not a deep trough.  And not a ridge that will drive temps way above average. 

They are confident that a combination of El Niño, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation will be the main drivers for the forecast period. With the other teleconnections not doing anything anomalous to contribute. 

As a skier, looking at the drier than normal conditions, made my stomach drop. However, I did email meteorologists Ryan Knapp from the Mount Washington Observatory regarding a question I had about these 3-4 week outlooks. He told me to take them with a grain of salt because the Climate Prediction Center is making a forecast for the entire country…AND 3-4 weeks out. So although they are good at what they do, it’s hard to get these forecasts right all the time. What meant even more is that “below average” means exactly that. That doesn’t mean, no precipitation. Instead of 1-2 inches of precipitation we may get 0.5” to and inch. That could be up to a foot or more of snow for the mountains.

So don’t be too worried when you see that brown over New England. But I wouldn’t expect a week of Nor’ Easter’s during that period either.  Also, keep your fingers crossed that the ridge over the east doesn’t become too anomalous.  But I don’t think that will happen. 

Thanks!

Thanks!!

Thank you all for your comments.  I've been working in fine dining for the last few years, but will be transitioning back to the legal field after I pass the Wisconsin bar.  My wife is amazingly talented in many things, but is trying to figure out what what she'd like to do professionally.  We do lots of cooking, and play lots of board/card games.  We can't wait to go hit the rails to trails, but biking out here is not nearly as easy as some cities.  Housing wise, we need to stay under 1500/month.

"Hi! I'm a wedding photographer from Iowa and have a couple that is eloping in Door County in June. They have nothing planned beyond that, not even a ""venue"" (for 20ish people). I have never been remotely close to that area. Any heads up or tips are helpful for small venues or cool outdoor places for a ceremony and to take photos. Want some killer shots! Happy to connect with any WI photographers as well. Thanks in advance.

"So I have 100% Disabled Veteran plates. So far they have been great. I no longer need to ask my doctor to renew my handicap placard and I don't have to pay yearly registration fees. However, I have run into a hiccup. I cannot change the address on them at my local BMV, at least according to the people who work there. Do I really have to submit another form with proof that I am still 100% total and permanent with the VA ( I am, so there is no trouble doing that)?

Does anyone here work at the BMV and is able to share some insight?

Edit: Solved. I was able to update the address on my registration by calling the Ohio BMV's main line. I still have to send a form in to get a copy of the registration with the updated address. I'm buying a new car in the next month, so I will be able to get a new copy with the new car then I guess."|Ohio|2021|False|0

Months ago, I read that Li'l Abner used to be one of the most widely US circulated comic strips/books. However, it uses stereotypes of Ozark people that are part of broader stereotyping of southern mountain people. I read that the author, Al Capp, was from Connecticut, so this confirmed by suspicion that the dialects in the dialogue, e.g. pronouncing *confusing* as *confoosing*, of the characters are not remotely accurate. Do think that Li'l reinforced such stereotyping that most people would regard as cringe? Do people in Arkansas, especially during the height of the strip's popularity, really hate Li'l Abner and its reinforcing of Ozark stereotypes in boarder US culture.|arkansas|2023|False|0

# Quick Stats

**Overall Score - 80%**

**Timeliness** 4/10 - From quote to final install , it took nearly 6 months to complete. It finished November 27th.  This caused us to keep a tile design we weren't perfectly happy with but still found acceptable.  Prevented us from pointing out that the vanity cabinet and drawer design wasn't what we requested, we ultimately are happy with it but we didn't want to wait another one month and half for the correct vanity.  Lastly, caused us to fear asking for micro fixes/changes because we were unsure how much more it would delay the project.

**Communication** 9/10 - Only reason I didn't give a 10 here was because we weren't always sure when to leave our door unlocked so people could get in and work and sometimes crew would show up randomly (random for us) to work even on Sundays which was great.  Also as you can imagine being available over the course of 6 months gets extremely difficult as time drags on.

**Responsiveness** 10/10 - Jeremy would always respond in a timely fashion seemingly no matter what time of day.  There were times he would respond where we wondered why he was still ""working"".

**Quality of work** 9/10 - Mistakes happen, measurements aren't always good, I get it.  Aside from a couple of oversights, the work itself is great.  Even beveled the edges of tile around the shower, which I didn't know was a thing.

# Pros/Cons

**Pros**

1. The quality of work is great.  Very happy with it all
2. Great at coming up with workarounds or alternative designs
3. Gave us a budget for materials which we naturally went over each time an opportunity was given
4. They sent someone to clean once evidently this will happen again but haven't communicated this yet
5. Kept a tarp over-top of the dumpster trailer.  Always put down plastic or rugs to protect the flooring
6. um

**Cons**

1. Installed closet system before cleaning carpets
2. Vanity installed on top of dirty tile (well would have been but I cleaned the area first)
3. Other walls in the house were scratched or bumped, I painted most of them with the left over paint they used
4. Broke our key pad door lock, presumably from the many times the door was slammed closed or just the frequency of use.  Not sure.  But we have to manually lock and unlock it now.
5. Closet could have been measured a bit better we have an awkward light switch cover that is cut so the closet system doesn't overlap it
6. Didn't get the correct vanity, drawers and cabinets aren't really what we asked for.
7. Lost an outlet because the mirrors we wanted would have covered it and there really wasn't anywhere for it to go.  Partly our fault but could have been avoided IMO

# Details

**Timeliness**

Back in late June of 2023 we accepted the quote from Jeremy to complete our bathroom.  We had a tripped planned so he recommended that we not start until we got from our vacation.  Fair enough, easy way to avoid problems early on.  Fast forward to July, we got all our materials picked out.  Paints, tiles, colours, etc etc.   We were told that after everything was ordered and shipped, that it would only take about two weeks to complete the project.  Which we thought was a bit ambitious but hey, maybe he has an awesome crew.  Demolition started in July and things were going smoothly.  Materials start showing up at the house a one man demo team is working day and night, it's going great.

First speed bump, the plumber must be subcontracted, we had a no call no show once.  He had to make a few trips and came back a few times.  It took him maybe 4 days to move some of the piping.  Then he had to come back because the pipes were not in the right spot which caused about another week long delay.  Plumber wasn't very timely and didn't show up when he was supposed to.  Got the work done the same week but it ended up being incorrect which delayed us an entire week. After he fixed the piping.

Second speed bump pops up.  The City notices we are having work done and finds no permit was issued for the work.  We had a wall removed and some plumbing that needed to move.  Which means we need a permit.  Jeremy got this knocked out quickly and the City let them continue working with in about a week and a half, if I remember correctly.

Not sure how or why but the custom vanity took 3 months to be built even though it was supposedly ready by the second month.  It finally installed in the 4 month of the project.

We had added some delay to the project by changing locations for lights and getting thing lined up more appropriately.  Also adding additional lights that weren't planned.  That added about two weeks.  After the tub was installed we noticed that the tile work left a hole in the slab exposed to where we could see the pipes also.  Well, we didn't like that so the tile had to be redone to cover the hole.  We had to wait for the only workers to be free from another job to come back and modify it.

We asked for a sliding door ""barn door"" style.  The door was ""too small"" for the opening but in retrospective, we should have had a door frame extension so the sliding door could be locked and maybe a piece of rubber or something to prevent peeping eyes from where the sliding door doesn't meet the frame work at an angle. [Something like this.](https://imgur.com/EYdXEQQ) [And this.](https://imgur.com/fclbpzy)  We ended up getting a larger door which really isn't the correct solution but it works.  Anyway, the larger door caused two weeks of delay because the first one we ordered was damaged in shipping and then we needed to get a second.

Glass for the shower, these subcontractors were stereotypical.  ""We will be there next week on Monday"", then the next, then the next.  We also had to delay this by an additional week because we saw an issue with the tile work that we wanted corrected.  Unfortunately the one man that Jeremy has was already busy with another job that it took two weeks to correct, which caused another week of delay for the glass to be installed.

There were certainly other delays and I had wish I kept notes or done a better job of remember them all.  Unfortunately there is just too much going on in our lives to be able to be meticulous like that.  Although I wish I had tried to find more time to remember the other smaller delays to share with you folks.

**Communication**

Jeremy did a really great job of keeping us in the loop for when to expect people to show up to the house.  Unfortunately some of the subcontractors didn't show up when we were told they would or would show up on the wrong day at the right time.  Thankfully, we had a working key pad door lock that allowed them to entry when we weren't home.  We would normally catch them with our door camera and let them know the code if they didn't already know it.  Jeremy was always upfront with us about things being delayed or his communication with other subcontractors.  We felt like we were pretty much ""in the know"" for almost everything.  For planning the bathroom he added in his experience with certain things and we went back and forth on the design.  His input was valuable and in the end I think it helped reduce a lot of additional unnecessary costs.  He did admit though, if we were adamant about wanting something, he would do it, but told us it wouldn't be cheap.  For instance, moving a toilet from one side of the room to another.

**Responsiveness**

I separated this because I felt like it should be in a different category on it's owned based from issues that arose randomly.  As when the City inspector came on the wrong day.  Or the plumber showed up but we weren't home and he rushed over from a nearby job site to meet the plumber.  Answering the numerous questions we had during the project.  Getting things scheduled or re-scheduled last second due to whatever reason.  His phone must be implanted in his arm.

**Quality of Work**

Javier is a one man team of absolute master craftsmanship.  Not only did he demo by himself but he did; tiling, dry wall work, concrete cutting and repair, some plumbing for the shower, electrical, carpet, painting, installation of all the things.   He worked alone day in and day out.  No help at all.  Absolute beast.

The people who did the closet were great.  It took maybe 6 people to do our custom closet work in about an hour.  Zero complaints about them.  Haven't noticed a single issue with their stuff yet.

All the plumbing looked good from what I could tell.

The vanity cabinet doors are misaligned, aside from that the real wood of the vanity is nice.  It's very well made and it looks very unique.  We like it.

**Cost**

$40,000 USD because I know you are curious and so would I, if I were you.  

**End**

Ask me anything and I'll answer as best as I can.  I probably forgot to mention something but whatever.  I tried.

Cheers!

"From 102.9 WGO-Minot Facebook Page --

(ND) - This week’s report to Governor Burgum from the White House Coronavirus Task Force places North Dakota in the Red Zone in three of the main categories that the White House uses to determine the severity of COVID-19 across the nation.

All data is compiled and distributed weekly and is presented on a per capita basis so that states can be compared against each other equally.

This week’s report, dated 10/25/2020, contains some strong language from the White House to North Dakota.  In its recommendations to mitigate the spread of the virus, the White House report states, “We remain deeply concerned about the speed of the rapid rise in cases, test positivity, and hospitalizations, as well as the number of long-term care facilities with positive staff members, showing significant and escalating community spread. This expanding community spread is being fueled by silent spread in specific counties that is leading to symptomatic individuals. Finding and stopping both the visible and invisible spread through aggressive community testing is essential.”

The report also states that both North and South Dakota are of particular concern to the White House when it comes to the percentage of the total population that has been infected with the virus. “Efforts must intensify,” the report states. “Both North and South Dakota have the highest percent of the population infected, with documented infections approaching 5% and with the missed silent infections, 20% of the population may have been infected.”

A warning from the report spells out the dangers of indoor gatherings – even small ones. “Indoor gatherings are part of the continued and unrelenting spread. We continue to see community-spread initiated by social friends and family gatherings. People must remember that seemingly uninfected family members and friends may be infected but asymptomatic. Exposure to asymptomatic cases can easily lead to spread as people unmask in private gatherings.”

"The day I was diagnosed with covid I got unnecessarily shitfaced alone in my house. After 5-6 beers, the CDC called and wanted names and phone numbers of everyone I had been in contact with that week. I told them I didn't feel comfortable answering and hung up. Three beers later they called back and I didn't answer.

The next day they called again, and while grilling me, I get another phone call. So being an asshole I tell her I have another call, I have to take this. I pick up and it's Burleigh county.

""We understand you're being difficult. If you don't comply, we'll be forced to come to your home with law enforcement and do a wellness check.""

So. Yeah. All of this could have been avoided if I wasn't a drunken idiot. All it amounted to was me emailing them everyday to tell them I was fine and complying with my quarantine. Now it's over and I haven't heard squat.

So if you get covid be nice to the CDC 😂

"Apologies if this is the wrong sub to post in. My gf and I are headed to Acadia this weekend for the July 4th weekend driving up from NYC and will be at the park from July 1-3rd. Very excited for the trip, been wanting to go to Acadia for quite some time. However, I'm getting worried that the traffic and crowds there will be bad...I'm hearing mixed things about it being bad, but not NYC bad. So I wanted to directly ask the people of the state! Exactly how bad will the traffic be and how crowded? We'll probably be using the bus for the first two days (sat and sun), but I'd like to be able to drive on the last day (monday). I know July 4th is a specific time frame, so any information on the weekend vs the weekday would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  

&nbsp;

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your helpful comments. I drove there expecting the worst and got the best, at least the best for a holiday weekend. Traffic was not bad at all, like AT ALL (sorry for the caps, but that's how surprised I was that there was no traffic). Starting early around 8am each day certainly helped. I ended up skipping the island explorer bus and just driving around in our car. I did all of the ""popular"" hikes first thing in the morning to skip the crowds and that definitely helped. Did Beehive first thing and while there was a small wait along the iron ladders, I'm sure it was nothing based on the crowd I was seeing as I finished the trail (also beat the sun). Beech Cliff was open and completely empty, as was the rest of the quiet side. Jordan Pond House was packed parking wise, but we were able to get a table pretty quickly (10min for indoors, 20 min for outdoors - I would suggest an outdoor table if you can stand the heat). Views were gorgeous. One tip I would give is that some of the parking lots are tiny, but just wait 10-15 min in your car and one will open up eventually. Also, Smokey's BBQ right outside of the island is DA BOMB for any bbq lovers. Ok, this is getting long, but hope it helps someone someday :)"|Maine|2017|False|0
"Hello Maine. I and 3 of my friends will be visiting from New York this weekend and I would love your advice.

The plan is:

1. Arrive in Millinocket this Saturday night (7/1/17)
2. Sunday we begin hiking by 6:30 AM and finish by 6:30 PM the latest. 
3. We eat and sleep off the long hike.
4. Monday morning head back to New York.

The advice I seek is in step 3 & 4. My hope/plan is to drive at least a couple of hours south on the 95 before going to sleep on Sunday night. That way on Monday we have extra time to spend on sight-seeing or potentially dropping by Boston.

I was hoping you could give me some advice as to where to rest Sunday night based on this [**MAP**](http://i.imgur.com/CuFSoCM.png).

The blue line represents the quickest route home (staying on the 95) and I wouldn't mind resting at any of those towns. I am also not against the idea of staying somewhere along the red line I drew.

Just an interesting city / landscape or any place you think worth checking out/staying the night at.

Finally, we are also interested in having some good lobster. If you can think of any places along this route please let me know.

Thank you.

"I'm moving to Portland with a date of August 1st to August 13th from several states away. Thus far I've been using craigslist and sites like trulia to scope out apartments. However, I've noticed the housing market moves very quickly and there are only very few places available for the time I'm looking for so far.  I'm trying to come up with a viable plan for visiting and securing an apartment but the speed at which places are rented makes me unsure of the timing. 

My plan is, when places do become available for the dates I need, to call and arrange a showing and then my SO will drive to Portland to see them. We are thinking he could stay a weekend and see as many places as he can and secure one in this time. From the looks of it, he may not be able to do this until mid July (for example most apartment listings up now are for July 1st or available now) and so it makes us in a serious time crunch for getting it all sorted out. 

For those with experience or knowledge about how renting works in Portland, does this sound like a feesible plan or will we screw ourselves? How much time/how early should we call for showings, how competitive are places? What are the chances by the time my SO makes it out to look at places, it will already be taken? Any other advice you may have? 

When I've moved somewhere from out of state before it was easy to secure an apartment several months in advance without even needing to see it in person or sign papers before move in day, and they certainly didn't ask for references or credit checks.  Portland seems more fast paced and has more rental requirements, so I'm just not sure how to navigate it all. 

Thanks in advance!"|Maine|2017|False|0
"the idea was floated a few years ago to consolidate Lewiston/Auburn and by doing so would make it a near-rival of Portland in population. but it stalled out for a variety of reasons, one being that culturally/politically Lewiston and Auburn are very different.

but what if Maine consolidated the Portland-area municipalities? they all tend to be culturally and politically similar. here's what a consolidated Portland might look like combining Portland, South Portland, Westbrook, Cape Elizabeth and Falmouth:

-A population of 133,000~, roughly around the 200th biggest city in the United States (currently Portland is ranked #530).
-A land size of about 92 sq. miles
-A density of about 1,437 people / sq mile

It'd be less dense than Orlando, roughly the size (population and land area) of Waco, TX - and actually, Waco's metro area population is about the same as Portland's, too.

Orlando and Waco each have 6 city councilors and, yet, Orlando is more than triple the popluation of Portland, Waco about double. Portland currently has 9 on city council. Combined, all the Portland-area municipalities considered in this merger currently have 37 councilors governing. THIRTY SEVEN! 

Wouldn't it be easier to solve the housing crisis, infrastructure issues and future development of the Portland region if everyone was officially working together? The municipal savings, political expediency, marketing/attractiveness, and infrastructure would improve immensely. And, unlike with Lewiston/Auburn, it's not like you are trying to marry right and left, more like marrying left and left so there is no political-party advantage either way

Portland would go from the 29th biggest city in New England to the 6th- much more indicative of it's current economic power and attractiveness as a growing city. just a thought

EDIT: i'm well aware of the make-up of the communities mentioned. very well aware that C.E. and Falmouth would (somehow) stick their noses even higher in the air at the mention of this- that brings in to doubt the feasibility of such a plan, but not the merits. having ALSO been to many medium-sized cities (100,000 - 250,000) i know that such ""different"" communities like Falmouth and South Portland can be governed under one roof, and when you compare to the socio-economic diversity of medium sized cities it would make a consolidated Portland look VERY homogenized (thus, ""politically and culturally similar""- a notion that seems wack when you are zoomed in, but zoom out and compare that to other cities and you'll see its actually very similar). this post is mostly about showing that a consolidated Portland is not very radical when compared to other cities in the country. In fact, it fits in almost perfectly in population, size and density with other places. so, if cities in the midwest and west can function governing a city just as physically big with just as many people and actually be GROWING, why can't Portland?"|Maine|2017|False|0

I live in a highly vaccinated area in the north. We don’t have much covid here anymore. We don’t have a mask mandate but most people wear them anyway in public. 

So why are people down there really rejecting the vaccine? At first I thought it was continued covid denial, but now with the delta variant  it’s gotten pretty hard to think that’s still the case. Considering these people are now taking medication for farm animals as a preemptive measure for covid, it can’t be denial anymore.

"Everyone was beautiful, in their most cute festival-wear.  It was the standard outing, pretty much how you can picture any major sell-out fest running these days is exactly how it went down.

The beards were perfect, the dresses colorful, the PBR flowed like it was a frat party in 1986.

I got there at 1pm for Diarhhea Planet thinking it was a totally different band.  The name elicits such visceral imagery I could have sworn they were some kickass pyschpunkextremeprotocore group, but no it was some Warped tour glitz pop punk with four, count 'em, FOUR guitarists and a bassist all playing power chords and taking turns doing solos and making rockstar faces while they creamed their pants and took themselves way too seriously.  Boring, generic, and mindless.

The middle sets of bands were such a snooze that I have managed to successfully block them from my mind already.  I have vague memories of Courtney Love-esque vocals and a Fleetwood Mac grunge cover band.  Everyone seemed mildly thrilled to at least be outside on a nice day.

I thought Parquet Courts were going to be a highlight, but at that point I'd already heard 67 guitar solos and was done with rock music entirely as a genre, so I just couldn't get into them either.  Unknown Mortal Orchestra turned out to be one of the more entertaining sets, but I found myself spacing out during them too and wondering why I even came out.

I couldn't tell if Ween were doing Grateful Dead or Phish covers.  The crowd was too baked to be able to tell either.

Lame Impala put on their most tame performance yet, and I was worried the band was going to fall asleep to their own generic space rock theatrics.  To remind everyone they were actually at a live show, they blasted a bunch of streamers and confetti multiple times that will probably kill at least a few fish or birds.  Their perfect hair and Aussie accents made it worth the $60 ticket, though.

This is what happens when a cynical asshole goes to a mainstream rock fest.  I should have known better.

The best moment was when a dude dropped his fresh PBR on the ground, puncturing it and making it spew everywhere.  The crowd chanted ""Shotgun it!"" and ""Chug!"" and the dude abided and killed that beer in a moment any capitalist would have been proud of."|Portland|2016|False|0

"Roo: Chihuahua mix, tan/white

Missing 8/28/2018 about 6PM

11 year old spayed female with slight scarring on front legs and larger scar on rear flank

Has a heart murmer

No tags and no chip

Is dog aggressive to the point of barking and charging- no biting

Is usually a bit people shy

Loves car rides

Please help me. I've made a terrible series of mistakes/carelessness and now I've lost my best friend, my emotional support animal and my fur child. I have a Jeep Wrangler and the windows are off. My dog Roo loves to stick her head/neck out of the rear window (it's lower on Jeeps/the seat is higher). 

I took her in my Jeep from Midval heading to Riverton. We traveled out of our neighborhood West down 7200 S and turned South on State Street. The last time I believe I saw her stick her head out was about 8000 S State. I continued on State to 12300 S and turned West heading to Riverton. I look back in my side mirror pretty frequently to watch her when she sticks her head out. She hadn't in a while, but sometimes she doesn't when the wind is in her face. I finally turned around to check on her when I was on 12300 S and about 2000 W. 

She wasn't in the back seat. This is my worst nightmare, I keep thinking I'll wake up. She must have leaned too far and then fallen. This was around 6PM. I called a few people for help and we've been driving the route I took for hours, I finally quit when it was dark. I believe she is alive because we didn't see any sign of a hit animal on the roads. 

I have a harness and leash strapped to my roll bar- I should have strapped her in.

I have always wanted to get her chipped and was actually going to do it next month, though I told myself that often. She's always with me.

I shouldn't have had my music blasting so I could have maybe heard her fall out. 

I should have checked back on her often so I could have noticed if she fell earlier.

I was beyond careless but nobody could love this little girl more than me. She isn't a dog to me, she is my child. I would give anything to fix even one of the mistakes I made causing me to lose her. She gets cold pretty easily, I'm so worried about her being cold, scared, lonely and hungry. I adopted her from the Humane society about 4-5 years ago. She had been in the shelters for about a year. I promised her that I'd always take care of her and she'd never be alone again.

I looked for her, I called SL County animal services (they only wanted to transfer me to Riverton). I left a message with Riverton animal services and called a number they provided on their voicemail which I think was county emergency dispatch. The word has gone out on my social media but I don't have many friends or family. 

Please help me in any way you can. Please share this on social media, or let me know what else I can do. Please keep your eye out for her in any of these areas: Midvale, Sandy, Draper, Riverton.

I know I made so many mistakes but she has a happy home here and I'd give anything to have her back. I need to know that she's not out there by herself. She is such a very good girl.

All I have to offer is $300 for her return or direct information leading to her return.

These are some pictures of her: Roo, Chihuahua mix 12lbs Missing 9/28/18 https://imgur.com/gallery/xHkHSqI

At the moment, I can only seem to find it at actual dry ice regional distributers, and they require a minimum order of 30 pounds or something, waaaay more than I could use. "|Connecticut|2018|False|0

Hey you crazy Canberra people. 

As you're so crazy, why not go out on a winter's day?

#What will be there?

* Soup 

(I'm planning a barley based soup, and a pumpkin soup. Any dietary requirements, let me know)

* Freshly cooked bread

(Any dietary requirements, let me know)

* Music

(Love a jam session, but I will bring a bluetooth speaker)

* Stimulating conversation

* Some shelter

* 12 Volt Power

* Fresh Water

* Maybe a fire barrel


* All of you sexy, sexy people, and some of your friends

#What won't be there

* Chairs

Bring a camp chair.  I can bring a few, but I'm expecting you to bring your own.

* Bad attitude

* Alcohol sales

We're going to be in a public place.  If you want to bring a drink along, all well and good.  Don't be silly about it, though.

* Rubbish

We're all grown up enough to clean up after ourselves, I'm sure.

what are the unique restaurants in the area/restaurants that shouldn't be missed?

Between the rock climbing gyms around central CT which ones are the best?

For social things, are there sports leagues for the town, or should I look for something closer to a bigger town (E.g. New Britain)? I'm a fan of ultimate frisbee but am down to learn other sports. 

I also enjoy Magic the Gathering but I'm just okay at it (i.e. play with friends and a beer, not competitively) and would love a shop to go play once in a while.

"I am glad I rejoined the Independent Party because I am learning about all kinds of corruption in our elections and the CT GOP this year. For all they scream about Democrats cheating...

Michelle Botelho is a Conservative Independent Party member. More conservative than candidates our Independent Party usually nominates but understood the GOP was corrupt and joined our party.

She did not have as good of a chance at winning the Waterbury Caucus for the 5th congressional race against Jahana Hayes as other Independent Candidates might have.

She didn't get a fair chance though and lost the nomination by about 10 votes to Republican Candidate George Logan.

George Logan from the CT GOP challenged her for the Independent Party ballot line. Apparently, the assistant chair of the Independent Party in Waterbury, Laurence DePillo, is in Stefanowki's back pocket.

In addition to the slimy practice of Republicans joining the Independent party on purpose just to vote for CT GOP members to get a second ballot line, this time Logan made it extra obvious.

When Logan announced he secured the Independent Party line on the ballot he said in his announcement, ""Our team worked hard on the grassroots level to earn the required support needed at the caucus"" 

Logan conveniently left out that one of the Republicans that joined and crashed the Independent Party to vote for him at the caucus was his own wife!

We need CT leg to make a law limiting candidates to ONE LINE ONLY in a race or they'll never leave our party alone. :(

"Hoping the friendly people in this sub will assist me with a query.

I own a rental property in the Darwin CBD and am having a long-running discussion with the tenant about the price of their power bill. Long story short, there was a problem with the aircon, which was fixed, but the tenant is now claiming their power bill is still too high.

I have an open mind about it, and want to hear about other peoples' actual real-life experiences.

So, if you don't mind telling me, how much do you pay per quarter for electricity in the CBD? Please let me know the type of dwelling and number of people.

I'd really love to hear from people who are couples in relatively new 2x2 apartments, as that will give me the closest data to the current situation. But also happy to hear details from other situations, anything will help.

Thanks a lot in advance!

"Hi all,  
So I've lived in Alaska for the majority of my life, grew up here even, but yet have never had the opportunity to visit some of the beautiful sights we have up here. My Alaskan life consisted mostly of being in either Anchorage or the Matsu Valley, and I'm looking to finally explore the rest of the state now that I'm older and capable of independent travel.   
I don't mind if any of the places you recommend are only accessible by air or sea, I'll just figure out a way to get there some other day. In the meantime, anywhere that can be accessed by car from Anchorage would be amazing (duration and distance won't matter too much).

Here are some places I already have in mind for visiting:

* Wood-Tikchik National Park, Kobuk Valley National Park, Katmai National Park (for The Valley of 10000 Smokes).
* The Great Kobuk Sand Dunes, The Nogahabara Sand Dunes.
* Illiamna Lake, Lake Clark, Becharof Lake, Lake Louise, Terror Lake (it sounds cool).
* Kotzebue, Nome, Little Diomede, Utqiagvik, Delta Junction.

A friend of mine has some job opportunities in Bethel and King Salmon.

Of course everything is going to be much more expensive, but we'd like to do some math on whether the advertised salary and COLA would be sufficient.

How do people find places to live in very small communities like King Salmon? Is there a facebook group we could look at to see how much rents run around there?

"Hi all, 

I've been given a transfer from England to Oklahoma and have to give my decision in over the next week. 

I'm feeling quite uneasy as I'm a British Indian (Asian Indian) with quite visibly Indian attributes and brown skin, I'm seriously concerned about the prospect of racism, which I've never ever faced in England.

Additionally, I have no understanding of gun culture, which really, is my **biggest concern**. 

I can take some racial slurs on the chin, but being around guns is just something I've never had to live with. I've never been confronted with a gun in England, nor any of the places that I've travelled to in Europe.

With constant reporting of: mass shootings, gun crime and racism in the USA, by British news outlets anyway, with a *police officer* in Oklahoma being recorded saying that he wanted to string up black people, I'm just feeling slightly... off, about the whole thing.

Hey y'all,

I've posted this on some of the local college pages and not sure if this is allowed here, but I'm a college student and my boss and I are looking to start hiring / training some people for next summer. Its a Direct Sales job for a local business in OKC and Tulsa, we hire almost exclusively college students to come and sell for us, this year we hired a bunch from OU and ORU, and we had a lot of success. Feel free to ask general questions here or DM me for more details. The job pays anywhere from 5-8K per month depending on how hard you work.

Sales is not for everyone, but it provides a ton of opportunity to learn, we do direct trainings every day during the summer with some of the best salesmen in the industry. My main goal though, is to provide financial freedom and opportunity to other students/ young people. We are not hiring everyone who applies, but anyone who can work hard and has basic social skills should be able to succeed. 

The reason we are hiring now is because there is some pre-summer training that can really help you make more money, and there are recruiting incentives, like a free cruise to mexico in the spring with the team.

Thanks everyone for your time, if you know anyone 18 or older that needs a summer job, feel free to direct them here, or DM me for other ways to contact us. "|Oklahoma|2023|False|0

2. Mountain biking in the same area: not looking for anything challenging like the (double) black diamond trails right on Mount Major, something like flowy blues and greens will be about right.

"Beware  of the Spectrum / Charter Direct Sales Rep who is canvassing  southern NH to ""win back"" former Spectrum customers who recently  switched to Fidium Fiber. Last week, he knocked on my door and won me  back to Spectrum with the promise of 300 Mbps in both directions -- down  and up. The price was good for what I perceived would be better speeds  than Fidium (I had 250 down and up with Fidium), so I made the switch back to Spectrum. As soon as I activated my new Spectrum internet  service, I ran a speed test and was getting about 300 down and only 9  up; I called Spectrum tech, as well as visited our Spectrum store in  Keene, and both service reps told me that 300 Mbps in both directions is impossible with Spectrum -- they don't offer this combination of speeds at all. I've called and  emailed the salesman for three days to follow up, and his only response was an  email saying, ""I'm not pleased that you're experiencing less than  perfect results. I'll check into this today and get back to you as soon  as possible."" In other words, he framed the problem as if I'm not happy  with ""less than perfect"" speeds, when the problem is actually that he misled me about the upload speed. I can't say whether he is blatantly deceptive or merely misinformed; regardless, the outcome is the same: I  switched back to Spectrum under false pretenses. tldr; BE CAREFUL if you talk to the Spectrum / Charter salesman who is canvassing southern NH -- you will not get the upload speeds he promises."|NewHampshire|2023|False|0

"There was a post a while back about possibly getting some of us Denver ladies in our 30's/40's together & this post is follow up to that. I absolutely & 100% understand the woes & complexities of logistics, so I am being the change I wish to see and posting this here for anyone who falls into this category. We all know not everyone who responds shows up & vice versa, though that's why I'm going with a large, outdoor open space (also my partner is extremely COVID cautious, which I suppose keeps life interesting, but also mostly very lonely). 

Anyhow, deets! 

Who: 30's/40's female-identifying Denverites (of course friends, pets, relatives, SO's, younger/older folks, are all welcome too, though just know & respect that you won't be the focal point!) 

What: Picnic fun -- bring a game, bring a snack or drink to share (I'll have a tray or two of light munchies minimally, so no worries if that's not in your capacity), bring a blanket, bring music, bring nothing but yourself -- it's all good whatever you decide. 

Where: Cheeseman Park, South Side (near 8th ave across from Little Cheeseman -- I'll bring signs & wear a big pink hat though please DM if you're lost!!) 

When: Sunday, September 3 between 1-3 pm. If things are hoppin' I'm happy to go later. If it's enough of a success, maybe we will try this again next month! I'm not a super early person though will do my best to be maybe 5-ish mins early. Again, DM if you are lost & can't find me.  

Why: There is obviously enough interest & need, and I already spend enough time at Cheeseman on my own anyway. 

I'll re-post as we get closer to Sunday. Ladies, let's do this thing!"|Denver|2023|False|0

Is this the usual case when calling for your snap benefit interview? Or do you think it’s longer now because of the massive call volume they’re receiving due to the current health crisis.

"It's currently 80.2ºF in my apartment but only about 50ºF and sunny outside. I get that, at this point, in Chicago, there is no guarantee we won't be in for more cold nights before June and city ordinance requires the building maintainers to maintain certain minimum temperatures, but it's become quite uncomfortable inside.

Are there any easy solutions that don't require installing custom hardware?

"Hey, I am cross posting to r/DND & r/DungeonWorld in hopes of finding people interested in playing tabletop/rpgs on a weekly or bi-weekly basis in the city. As far as I know, the only place with sufficient tables and free space is Dice Dojo but thats way up on the north side and only on Wednesdays (correct me if I'm wrong though.) While Dice Dojo is really great space, its sort of out of the way for a lot of people. 
I work at a cafe and we have a ton of table space, and are trying to start regular community events (FOR FREE) to make use of the space at nights (7-9pm). Some of the staff had talked about doing D&D or tabletop game night, to go with our potential lineup of Yoga, Movie night, ""ambient synth night"" and some other stuff. 
I know a lot of people have trouble finding either a group to play with, a space to meet regularly, or simply the tablespace for this. So I'm here to survey potential interest in a weekly or bi-weekly night, FOR FREE, at our shop. I'm not going to say the name unless we actually start it up, as I dont want this to come off as promotion. 
I'd like to stress that you don't need to have a group, though you can bring a group and just make use of our tables. My hopes for the event is to make it a communal game space for RPG/tabletop on a semi regular basis. We are located on the West side, so perhaps a bit easier to get to than Dice Dojo.

"Hi Reddit, just got an apartment for the first time and am feeling cautious because I watch way too much Judge Judy but what is the low down on making sure you keep your bond at the end of the lease?

I have taken an insane amount of photos of the place before I moved my things in and the real estate has given me till Thursday to return my condition report but all of their comments are very vague and photos not detailed/good lighting.

Do I:

A: Only return the condition report with my comments and keep my photos to myself

B: Return condition report with my comments and print out some photos, not all to hand in to the real estate, keeping the rest of the photos to myself

C: Return condition report with my comments and give real estate a usb with all of my photos

A friend has also moved out at the same time and they are doing Option A but I was really wondering about Option C but my only qualm is that if the real estate see how detailed I am, then they will be extremely detailed at the end of my lease, though naturally after a year of living there would be expectation of normal wear and tear.
I fear this especially because on the condition report I have now, all of their comments are extremely vague and their photos are not detailed or well lit.

I was hoping some of the amazing people here might consider signing and sharing this petition I started, which affects all pet owners Australia wide (Even if you aren’t in Australia, your support means the world).

It’s at over 1600 signatures now, and I’m planning to action it early next month. But I’d love to see it climb past 2500 before I do:

Pets across Australia are at risk of theft and loss, and the microchipping/registration system here is broken.

"Hey guys,

Last week, I went to Hairhouse Warehouse (Civic) to get my nose pierced. A couple of days into it, and my nose started to swell (as expected), however, the stud had started to sink into my nose!! Gross, I know! This is when I realised that the piercer at Hairhouse Warehouse had used a nose screw stud instead of an ""L"" shaped stud.

For reference, the L shaped stud is used for fresh piercings as it allows the stud to creep out if swelling extends beyond the size of the stud. The nose screw stud is kept in place regardless of how much swelling occurs. These are supposed to be used after the piercing has healed.

The swelling started at night so there were no piercers or doctors open this late to get it out for me. Sure enough, the next morning a layer of skin had started to form over the stud.

I instantly went to get it out at Hairhouse Warehouse, but the piercer wasn't in. So, I went to see the piercer at Redpaths. Because I was still able to push it out just enough to see the gem, he was able to take it out for me, cleanly and easily.

After also seeing a doctor, I was prescribed with antibiotic treatment to reduce the infection.

After going back in to Hairhouse Warehouse, to notify them of what had happened, they didn't seem to want to compensate me for the drama or money spent on damages, or even slightly care whatsoever, but rather, placed the blame on me and I was told that ""I am allergic to surgical steel."" Which is untrue as I have more than one surgical steel earring currently in my ear, causing no issues.

The biggest problem was denying they used the wrong stud (nose screw), and claiming that this is the standard; meaning they will continue to use these studs on clients, causing potentially much worse problems.

So if you're thinking of getting a piercing, drawing on experience, I would 100% NOT recommend Hairhouse Warehouse ((Civic) I can't speak for any other locations).

I've had several piercings at Redpaths (including a nose piercing once), all of which I've had no problems with - 100% recommend

Tl;dr: Hairhouse Warehouse in Civic pierced my nose with a nose screw, causing it to sink into my nose + become infected. Told me it was because I am allergic to surgical steel, despite all the surgical steel earrings I currently have"|canberra|2017|False|0

"I'm working on grading my lawn and I'm not sure if I can pull dirt from the back area of my property. About a quarter acre of it is swamp, and the other three quarters of an acre is land that gets soggy easily and has a lot of those phragmites (reeds). Once it warms up I can drive my tractor back there no problem (except the small swamp). It sounds like from the EGLE website below that I can't touch the back without a permit, but I have family members saying I can pull dirt from it. According to them, the big no-no is filling the swamp or causing water to drain into a neighbor's property.

"A family member of mine was arrested for driving under the influence. Both of his parents had died earlier this month and he was driving home after sorting things at their house when someone saw his driving and called the cops. They showed up while he was sitting in front of his house with the car still running. He refused the breathalyzer and they took him in to the station. He works an hour and a half away and desperately needs his job to support his ailing wife. It was his first offense and he has no criminal history.

"I moved here from Florida.  Not that I enjoyed it but I'd describe the driving style of most Floridians as either too fast or too slow and with an almost enviable lack of consideration of others and general ignorance.  I can't tell you how many times I almost wished I didn't use my blinker to signal intent because of how many assholes see it as an opportunity to make sure you can't merge by blocking you in.  

Now I'm here and yeah, I've seen the ""Massholes"".  However, I've also had this weird thing happen to me like once or twice a week.  I will be at a stop sign, waiting to enter a two lane road (double yellow stripe style) and a driver on the two lane will come up with their blinker on, stop before making their turn, and then flash their lights or try waving at me to ""let me go.""  A. I can barely see you through the glare and dust on your windscreen.  B. If I hesitate and pull out too late and you run into me, who would be at fault? And 3, can you just make the fucking turn and get out of everyone's way? I feel like there is a reason cars don't have a way to signal that you are relinquishing your right of way lol.

"Good morning! 

Yesterday morning I went and hiked the Marlboro Trail @ Monadnock, and I found a trekking pole that someone left behind.

If you were there yesterday morning (1/28/23) and lost a trekking pole, please message me and I will easily be able to confirm if it is yours.

"In Florida I know a landlord can't just threaten to throw a tenant out. Most of the time the process is more costly than is worth. The only time I've ever seen it happen was from a landlord whose wife was a millionaire.

My dog is a 70lb husky mix who is healthy with good stamina.

I have the hikes listed below penciled in (criteria of out-and back or loop, dog friendly, can be completed in one day). If there are other suggestions, I'm glad to hear them!

"Hey redditors, at about 4pm today a friend of mine was walking to her car from the Botanical Garden and was approached and chased by a man rummaging through the garbage cans around 11th/12th and York in Cap Hill. She described the guy as follows: 

- a white man in his early 40s
- shirtless
- wearing khaki pants
- very dirty
- either severely mentally ill or on drugs

Upon seeing her, this gent shouted ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT, SYLVIA?"" and began to run towards her, at which point my friend ran to her car and took off (I should note that this woman's name is not Sylvia). Apparently, the dude chased her all the way to her car. Luckily, my friend was a good bit faster than this guy. 

Anyways, she's since alerted DPD, but I thought I'd post on here to warn others."|Denver|2016|False|0

"Hi /r/Denver, 

My boyfriend and I were just out walking our dog when a man drove up and stopped his car & turned on his hazards next to the sidewalk we were on to get our attention. He said that he was just a few blocks down the street and saw a stray dog that looked like ours and was curious enough to think that the stray he had seen was the dog we were now walking. He kept asking us questions about the stray and whether there were signs up for it, to which we said there is another missing black dog in the area but assured him that this dog belongs to us. He then turned down the street and circled back around to find us again walking into our apartment because it seemed like he wanted to see where we lived. 

This guy may or may not have had bad intentions. But we genuinely cannot figure out why he did this. It seems like he was trying to accuse us of taking the stray dog, or he wanted to get a look at our dog. Has anyone at all heard of this happening around Denver, or does this just seem like a one time thing?

Edit: In case anybody is genuinely curious, this happened at 14th & Humboldt and the guy was driving an older white Ford Taurus-looking vehicle."|Denver|2016|False|0
"My brother had his  [adorable little husky puppy](http://imgur.com/rjwb5ux) ~~stolen~~ taken today around 4 o'clock from in front of their house on the corner of Hope ct. and McElwain. We have surveillance footage of a car pulling up calling to her, and driving away with her, but it's awful quality. [This is the best shot i could take of the car.](http://imgur.com/lqFScK0) (taken from a phone of a monitor, sorry) Hard to tell make or model, even color is questionable, we think it's maroon-ish.

She broke out of the yard a few minutes before the car showed up. and by the time anyone noticed anything, they were long gone. 

If i can find a way to upload the video i will, but the dvr is old, and doesn't seem to have the capability to do so.  And a phone recording of a bad quality cctv recording probably won't be of much help. 

Any information about, or help with this will be greatly appreciated as the family is all pretty distraught over this, not to mention husky pups are not cheap. We're checking craigslist, shelters etc.  but are having no luck. Thanks for reading.

We are budgeting for a house somewhere around 200-225k and would like to be close enough to a higher population area with access to some nice bars and restaurants. We don’t particularly want to be IN the city but on the outskirts with a short commute. We love being on the coast but don’t particularly need to be near the ocean. We’ve lived in multiple smaller cities around Boston and love the lifestyle and the fast pace. We also spent nearly a year living in an RV and are okay with a small house.

"Anyone local to the 757 area dealing with this too?

So I’m a 28 year old male, andI had covid during the New Year, it took me about 2 weeks before I was well enough to return to work, and about another 2 weeks to feel like my normal self again.  Fast forward a couple months to mid April, and I started feeling.. off.  

Chest pains, elevated resting heart rate, brain fog, fatigue, vision impairment just to name a few.  After going to the Norfolk General ER because of the chest pains/elevated heart rate, all results and blood work came back fine.  I scheduled an appt with my Primary doctor the next week, and had some standard blood work ups done, and everything came back fine as well.

"I grew up in a wonderful area of southern Utah County called Elk Ridge. Part of the appeal was being right at the base of the mountains surrounded by incredible scenery and wildlife.  Our yard is often visited by deer and elk and it was a huge reason why my parents decided to live there.

 Some of the city’s residents however hate deer and wildlife coming into their yards and have complained to the city council.   Consequently, they have decided to do a round up and slaughter of these beautiful creatures over the month of August. It’s beyond me that anyone would move to an area such as this and feel like the local wildlife is encroaching on them.  

 This is cruel and unnecessary, and while I know conservation does include the occasional culling of animals, this is driven by a few who feel annoyed from living along side these creatures.   Not wanting to start a debate but for those of you who feel like the problem is us and not them, I would encourage you to please sign this petition asking for this to be stopped.](https://chng.it/DjCyR4hzPg)"|Utah|2023|False|0

"My wife and I are currently in search of a rental to live in near Lehi, where my new job is located. We are open to living slightly outside of the city or in a nearby city if it offers more affordable rentals and I can commute to work. We have a small dog and cat as pets.

"TL;dr - Looking for a residential structural engineer and/or a contractor that can/will remove a wall and perhaps install some cabinetry/countertops, both of which would be around 10 feet long. Recommendations? Tips for how or where I should be looking? Area of service: 46218.

Recently purchased a home and am looking for a general contractor to remove a small wall. I've never needed a general contractor before, so I don't know any that specialize in what I'm looking for. I've done some searching online, but most contractors either don't have pages/sites/profiles with much information at all, or market themselves as doing jobs like complete remodels and other much larger jobs, so it's hard to tell if they'd be interested or charge reasonably to remove 10 feet of wall (and maybe install some countertop).

Pretty much the same story for the structural engineer; very few listings come up from a cursory google (yelp, angieslist, etc.) search and those that do don't have any info regarding their business, like where they serve, their insurance status, contracts, etc. 

I definitely plan to start calling the businesses that have appeared to find more information - as I realize that's likely just how this industry works - but I wanted to see if the subreddit had any suggestions for me on either front. 

Note: I realize I need both, not an either/or, but I figure if I can find one that I like, they might have recommendations for the other, so I'll take whatever lead you have."|Indianapolis|2019|False|0

"Hey guys,

I'm happy to say that I'll be starting a job as an entry level engineer in Huntsville! I'll be moving in about a month, and I'm starting my apartment search now. I'm looking for something decent for no more than $900 a month, and I'm finding that Madison and South/East Huntsville have the best looking postings in that range. Where would be the best place to go as a young engineer?"|HuntsvilleAlabama|2016|False|0
"The last two times I have gone to the Redstone PX, they have been sold out of the very popular green Federal Supply Service Notebooks. I also need a 6 ring binder for some loose leaf rite-in-the-rain paper and none of the office supply stores that I talked to on the phone appear to carry them.

Is there anyone out there who I can buy either of these things from ASAP? I leave TDY for an extended duration starting Tuesday.

Thanks!"|HuntsvilleAlabama|2016|False|0

"Hello everyone,

I grew up in Green River, Wyoming from 1986-2005.  During my last year there, I got in a lot of trouble with the law.  I took some plea deals and after 15 years of not being that person anymore, I am looking to get these things taken off my record.  

I've looked at the Wyoming State Bar website and called a few of the recommendations on there but the few I called told me they don't handle expungements.  Does anyone know of any attorneys or has anyone done the process themselves?"|wyoming|2020|False|0

I just signed a lease for a new apartment (which is super exciting!!) that has electric heating. It’s not baseboard, more like I a little vent in the wall and every room has its own thermostat. I have only ever lived places with an HVAC before so I’m not sure how much the electric bill is going to be in the colder months. The apartment is 1000 square feet... any ideas at what I could be looking at for electricity bills on a monthly basis?|wyoming|2020|False|0
Hello everyone I was thinking about moving to Wyoming from North Carolina. I’m 22 years old and working as a land surveyor. I was curious if anyone knows how the job market would be for my line of work? I’ve been working on roadways and mainly construction. I would appreciate any info on things like cost of living, quality of life, housing, and opportunities. Only thing I really know about Wyoming is there’s a serious lack of people and beautiful scenery which sounds amazing to me, just curious about the overall life and work aspect.

"Renters Rights Violation?

My landlord text me today, asking if I was home after I requested follow up for a repair that was started weeks ago.

The AC unit is going out and they came in at the time (over two weeks ago) and I gave them permission to check it out (screenshot with the white background). They came in, inspected and told me they need to replace it, but were wanting to hear from the owner since the unit was so pricey. They also put in a temporary unit at that time to help cool the house.

However, today… “are you home, this is James from (landlord name).”

I told him no, and he asked me details of the issues and that they’d schedule a time. (Screenshot with black background)

I came home and my door, from my kitchen that goes into my garage was locked, the AC unit was shut off, and the temporary unit was turned to the lowest setting to help cool the house, and my bedroom light was on.

Nothing, that I’ve noticed is missing, but is this not a violation of my privacy and renters right?

Any advice for information, questions to clarify, are appreciated. "|Tennessee|2024|False|0

"I've voted Democrat my entire life, I am pro-environment, pro-worker, pro-education, pro-literacy, but I can't do it anymore. Harris was installed not elected, she never won a single primary and yet the DNC shoved her in after  President Biden lost that debate. You don't have to like a candidate to vote for him, and Trump is more qualified.  
He was in office and we had cheap gas, I bought my first home under his presidency, we had great interest rates, we were at peace. The minute the Democrats got into office, Putin invaded The Ukraine.

Hey yall!!! I doubt there is much to be done, but I am trying to figure out who these people are… This is a postcard picture and is from somewhere in the 1920s or 1930s.

My 3x great grandparents were Clarence Alex Cobb and Allye Irvin Ezell Cobb, and they lived in the area of Indian Mound and Big Rock in Stewart County, Tennessee.

The Environment Dept has lost its status as a Department and has been placed in the Planning and Industry cluster. With the imminent death of NSW Marine Parks, this move has huge ramifications for terrestrial conservation. Watch as National Parks are progressively opened to lobby groups (shooters) and are commercialised - see recent changes to Lane Cove NP. Some of those in prime coastal locations,particularly in southern NSW may be opened for development. The placement of the Environment into a cluster that otherwise manages industry, minerals, water and primary industries (agriculture) and under a National Party minister shows the contempt that this government holds for the environment. This is the party who cheers every time environmental regulations are removed or watered down yet feign shock when a catastrophe like the Murray Darling occurs. Enjoy your National Parks - they will be irrevocably damaged by the end of this term of government. |sydney|2019|False|0

Hi reddit! I started dating an Aussie relatively recently (hence lack of knowledge of all things Aussie and why I still haven’t been there... sorry!) and found he gets homesick sometimes... I’ve lived away from home before... albeit not as far, but know the feeling well. So I wanted to gather things that would remind him of Sydney, where he’s from, or Australia as a surprise gift for the next time he feels this way. We’re in Canada, so anything that I can buy online or in North America would be the most feasible. Thank you! |sydney|2019|True|0

"Dear /r/LosAngeles, 

Recent posts about anticipated emergencies and disasters in L.A. (yipes!) have caused /u/LAFD to loudly wonder:

**Are official disaster plans for the City of Los Angeles in alignment with the thoughts, concerns and beliefs of redditors?**
_______ 
*The Good News...*

The City of Los Angeles [Emergency Management Department](http://www.emergency.lacity.org/) (EMD) is updating its Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP) to help reduce injuries and losses from disasters and ensure that critical services and facilities of the City will continue to function after a disaster. While our City has about 284 sunny days each year, we do face the potential for earthquakes, floods, fires, hazardous materials incidents, power outages, infrastructure failure, transportation accidents and terrorism.

________ 
*The Great News...*

**No one knows Los Angeles better than members of /r/LosAngeles, so we need to hear from you - and our friends at EMD make it easy via a simple survey** that allows you share what concerns you most about potential disasters. /u/LAFD asks you to take this opportunity to let our City leaders know exactly what concerns you before, during or after a disaster. Here's a direct link to the survey: 

**https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CityofLosAngelesLHMPSurvey**

We're not rich, but we make enough to feed our family and don't need the extra $300-ish. We've never had or used SNAP. My understanding is that while this p-ebt program is state-funded, the federal government is reimbursing states for all of it that is used, so I'd hate for it to go to waste.

I'm just looking to see if anyone can shed some light on the process of getting a resident parking sticker for Boston.

Currently, my car has CT plates. It's totally paid off and I'm in the process of getting insurance for the car in the state of Massachusetts and the title is on its way in my name.

As I udnerstand it, once the title is in hand, I can get my insurance and once that insurance is taken care of I can go to the RMV to apply for Mass plates.

Once I've got the Mass plates, I can apply for a resident sticker. Is this right? I've had friends who have said I also need my drivers license to go from a CT one to a Mass one as well but I've not gotten a definitive heads or tails about if this is something that I need to do to get my resident parking thing.

"Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Council Member Jamal Osman met with the Minnesota education commissioner last spring after the department halted federal nutrition funding to an organization now under federal investigation for fraud.

Education Commissioner Heather Mueller said in court documents that she believes the virtual meeting last May was ""the only meeting I've attended with government officials concerning \[the Minnesota Department of Education's\] administration of the USDA food program during the pandemic, Feeding Our Future, or any of Feeding Our Future's sites.""

The Minneapolis officials' involvement in the meeting is disclosed in civil court documents, which are drawing new attention after federal authorities [searched](https://www.startribune.com/fbi-investigates-nonprofit-feeding-our-future-for-alleged-fraud-millions-misused/600137966/?refresh=true) Feeding Our Future's headquarters last week as part of a fraud investigation. The organization and several associated with it are accused in search warrants of misusing federal money meant to provide meals for children in poverty.

A spokesperson for Feeding Our Future denied any wrongdoing on the part of the organization.

Osman founded Stigma-Free International, one of the nonprofits through which authorities allege money in the fraud scheme flowed, but said in a statement that he cut ties with the group before the period outlined in search warrants.

Frey received campaign contributions from six people named in the search warrants. He said he learned of the allegations after search warrants were unsealed last week. The mayor said he does not intend to keep the money and is working with an attorney to determine where he should send it, given the fraud allegations.

If the allegations are true, Frey said, ""it's reprehensible.""

**A virtual meeting**

Feeding Our Future was formed in 2016 and claimed to help community partners participate in the federal nutrition program.

According to court documents, the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) became concerned with the sharp increase in money going to sites sponsored by Feeding Our Future and blocked its funding. The organization sued the department in November 2020, claiming discrimination against a nonprofit that worked with racial minorities.

In May, while Feeding Our Future was challenging the department in civil court, Frey and Osman met with the commissioner and other staff at MDE, according to documents in the case. Frey discussed the meeting in interviews this week. Osman declined interview requests but issued statements.

Both Frey and Osman said they heard from people who were concerned about whether vulnerable people would have adequate access to food. Both said they recalled that the meeting was about federally funded food programs generally, rather than Feeding Our Future specifically.

Emails provided by Frey's office show that in May staff on the city's intergovernmental relations team asked state officials for clarity on whether requirements for the federally funded Summer Food Service Program had changed.

On May 13, a government relations representative for the city emailed MDE thanking them for information about the federal program and said Frey and Osman ""would like a meeting with the Commissioner to discuss this further.""

A virtual meeting was held the next day.

Frey participated in part of the meeting and said he is ""99% sure"" he left early to attend to something else. He later contacted a Star Tribune reporter to say he had corroborated with others present that he had left early.

""I didn't think twice about it,"" said Frey, adding that he frequently talks with state officials about other issues like the coronavirus pandemic and public works projects. ""It is almost the definition of my job to at the very least get additional information and understanding when a community is explaining concern around food shortage.""

Osman said in a statement Friday: ""I was very concerned about hungry kids during the closures of schools. I asked Commissioner Mueller to ensure that all effort was made to have this \[federal\] program feed underserved youth in Minneapolis.""

He added: ""I didn't mention Feeding Our Future or any other organization during the meeting. It was about kids in my ward being hungry.""

An MDE employee, in a deposition filed in court, said she did not recall Feeding Our Future being mentioned specifically but ""the issue of stop payment in general terms did come up.""

The education commissioner, through a spokesperson, declined to comment further.

**Forming a nonprofit**

In 2019, before his seat on the City Council came up for election, Osman and three others incorporated the nonprofit Stigma-Free International Inc., according to business filings first reported by the Sahan Journal. Records filed with the state in October 2020 update the list of incorporators, removing Osman's name and listing three new people .

In the search warrants released last week, federal authorities said Stigma-Free International is ""another company that appears to be fraudulently receiving Federal Child Nutrition Program funds under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future.""

The warrant says: ""Records obtained from U.S. Bank and Bank of America show that Stigma-Free International Inc. received more than $6.5 million from Feeding Our Future since January 2021. Bank records show that none of this money was used to purchase food or meals for underprivileged children.""

In a statement, Osman said that he formed the nonprofit as part of his work to provide businesses with training about crisis mental health responses. He said he ""gave up"" the nonprofit when he decided to run for office in the summer of 2020 and has had no association with it since then.

""While I operated and was associated with Stigma-Free, we never worked in delivering food or meals,"" Osman said. ""We had no association with Feeding Our Future and received no monies from them while I was with the nonprofit.""

Officials with Stigma-Free International — which has since dissolved — could not be reached for comment Friday.

**Donations and an appointment**

Two months after the meeting with the Department of Education, in July 2021, Frey received donations from six people listed in the search warrants.

The donations were logged within days of a fundraiser held at one of the addresses listed in the search warrants.

Frey said it was one of many fundraisers he's held with the Somali community, which has provided key support in his recent elections.

""Just to be very clear, there was no discussion whatsoever of these allegations or of the nature of any of the substance that is addressed in them,"" Frey said. ""As I recall, we talked about safety, police accountability, which was a topic in every fundraiser, and Somali history and politics.""

Each of the donors listed in the search warrants gave $1,000, the maximum amount allowed in a mayoral race each year. The donations represented a small fraction of the roughly $676,000 raised between Jan. 1 and Oct. 26, according to campaign finance reports.

One of those donors, Abdikadir Mohamud, was later appointed to the mayor's community safety work group. Frey said there was not an application process for the group.

""We routinely conduct community engagement and we heard from individuals that were interested,"" Frey said. ""A big part of all these groups was to have diversity of thought and background and so we wanted to ensure some Minneapolis, East African representation.""

Mohamud could not be reached. Frey said Friday that Mohamud is no longer on the group."|Minnesota|2021|False|0

"Use this information how you want.

I know what I will be voting on these 3.


**Edit:**
People are pointing out that if these 3 justices will be voted out, Rick Scott will get to choose 3 new ones. This is correct, and important to keep in mind.

However, according to BallotPedia these justices are relatively conservative to begin with.

If you look at BallotPedia's profiles on them, and scroll to the bottom, you see a score that was created by 2 professors at Stanford University. The score is an indication of how Liberal or Conservative Supreme Court Justices are.

Anything below 0 indicates a more liberal leaning judge, and anything above 0 indicates a more conservative leaning judge. The average score of Florida's Justices is a 0.51.

Canady scores a 0.87. [source](https://ballotpedia.org/Charles_Canady)

Labarga scores a 0.5. [source](https://ballotpedia.org/Jorge_Labarga)

Polston scores a 0.83. [source](https://ballotpedia.org/Ricky_Polston)

Of course this information is still rather limited in comparison to what we get on political candidates, but it is an indication of their ideologies.

Combining the facts that they voted that Amendment 1 was OK, are too conservative **for my taste**, and have already served their initial terms, I don't see much reason to keep these guys on the bench.

**Edit 2:**
In the [2015 case regarding gerrymandering](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article47576450.html) that came before these Justices, the following [final opinions of the court](http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2015/sc14-1905_Final_Opinion.pdf) are notable:

Polston **fully dissagreed** with the majority verdict of the court to adopt the district map *drawn by the opponents of the gerrymandering.*

Canady **partially dissagreed** with the majority verdict to adopt the non-gerrymandering map.

And Labarga **agreed** with the majority verdict to adopt the non-gerrymandering map.

"I made mistake of getting an apartment near freeway before I realized it can cause soot to accumulate inside and bottom of feet. Luckily windows and balcony dont face freeway however balcony rails def collect soot. Inside is not so bad after a deep clean.

I have central AC and It Gets too cold if I'm always running AC and I like to have leave window/balcony door open at night to be honest the air feels fresh and nice and cool and inside doesnt seem to get bad as a result of it.

I run A/C on my days off from 12pm-3pm when its hot. Thats all. So I'm not gettin much bang for buck on air filter on AC doing anything. I dont really like the AC on otherwise gets too chilly but I would consider if it makes a big difference in air quality.

My new idea is... What if I set the fan on my central AC controller to ON always instead of auto? Would the fans help filter some air? Does it push air through the same AC filter? I can leave fan all day with windows shut when i'm at work id fan would be helpful.

I have a house plant, may get more... considering an air purifier (altho I have zero allergies and this seems to be more aimed at allergens than black soot stuff?)

"I haven’t seen a post about it on the subreddit yet, so here it is (so no one is caught unaware). Sorry for the wall of text in advance. If you want the TL; DR, go here: [http://wvmetronews.com/2019/01/28/w-va-educators-ask-for-a-say-so-but-senate-votes-to-bypass-committee-on-bill/](http://wvmetronews.com/2019/01/28/w-va-educators-ask-for-a-say-so-but-senate-votes-to-bypass-committee-on-bill/)

The WV Senate railroaded a bill through today that is being referred to as the omnibus bill. The bill is 144 pages long according to some sources, and Sen. Rucker (who is charge of the finance committee) said the draft was just finished Thursday. When the committee discussed the bill earlier, she shut down any ability to discuss it with constituents. She also admitted that out of state lobbyists for private corporations that run charter schools were consulted in writing the bill, but it appears they didn’t even try to consult any educators.

Some of the things apparently in the bill (since they’ve been so quick about this, the text wasn’t even online as of a couple hours ago... and still might not be):
- Charter schools EDIT - Public Charter schools with their own local advisory boards that function like a BOE
- Vouchers (done in such a way that a parent could claim they were going to homeschool, get the cash, then enroll the student back into public schools a month later... keeping the money while the school gets nothing added to their own budget for said student) - EDIT - apparently they have to return some portion of it. It’s not clear how much, though.
- Larger class sizes for elementary (raised to 28, I believe) EDIT - 31, with 3 exceptions (meaning up to 34). I believe this is for K-3... I could only imagine the horror of 34 kids that young with one teacher.
- Seniority neutered by saying it isn’t the only thing used to determine RIFs anymore
- Big one here - we essentially become at-will employees who can be fired without cause at the discretion of our principal without cause (so, essentially, losing tenure) - EDIT - seeking clarification on this; some portions of the bill are just now being read through, and some changes don’t make a lot of sense.
- Paycheck “protection” - this is the requirement where teachers have to reenroll in their union every year. It was written by ALEC as a way of decreasing union participation in places where there was still strength despite right to work laws. In reality, all it takes is a phone call for me to stop union dues (which means I’m protected enough, thank you). This would require going to the board once a year to fill out paperwork again. Imagine having to do that for a utility every year. It’s nonsense, and they had no answers to the challenges like this last year - it’s just trampling my free speech by telling me what I’m allowed to do with my money supporting a perfectly legal organization.



My union had heard whispers for a while and offered to share their thoughts and those of affiliated teachers with Rucker. She declined.

The committee was not given enough time to discuss it before it was passed along party lines. It was then supposed to go to the finance committee (since, you know, the GOP is supposed to be all about fiscal responsibility AND railed on and on last year about how it’s irresponsible to pass bills without knowing how much they’ll cost). After announcing that, Carmichael decided instead to have the bill pulled from committee straight to the senate floor WITHOUT any idea of how much it will cost. 

This action has only been done twice in the state’s history, and shows just how desperate they are to railroad it through. 

The bill does include a couple of good things, but is written in a way that says any changes invalidates the whole bill. There is another 5% raise (laughable they’d give us another guaranteed 5% on top of last year’s raise without a lot of virtue signaling over the ability of the state to afford these actions), for example. Essentially, they’re giving us poison dipped in sugar.

Edit - fixing some information that was clarified at a meeting this evening. With how quick this is going through, there’s lot of misinformation we’ve been given."|WestVirginia|2018|False|0

Hello All, backstory… my best friend since I was 13yrs old is going through some things. We’re in our 30’s now. She’s had to send her children to their grandparents. Her oldest is a teenager (15/f) and now lives in Boise next to me instead of Texas (all she knows). Her mom is still in the other state. I must be out of the loop… everything I suggest to do with her sounds lame. Skate? Bowling? Movies?…. I don’t have kids but she’s my priority right now since I am her only friend currently. Until school starts. So wtf do you do with a teenager in Boise/Nampa/Caldwell anywhere ?!! Clubs ?! Summer program?! I need suggestions please and thank you! |Boise|2024|False|0
"Hi fellow Boise redditors, question for you. I live in a neighborhood that does not have an HOA, and while I love the perks of it (ability to park camper, no micromanaging HOA members, etc,) it’s apparent that there are some drawbacks to it. One being the lack of sidewalk maintenance on walks (there are multiple areas that I have to walk on the street with the baby’s stroller to avoid the overgrowth of weeds- and poor pup got some embedded cheatgrass in his paw last year that needed a pricey vet procedure ), as well as some residents letting their yard become overgrown with weeds. I’m not talking mild to moderate lack of lawn care maintenance, but extreme to where the weeds are waist level or higher. They are not my neighbor but it is something that I see from time to time as that house is directly near the entrance to the neighborhood. Another time we had random chickens in our backyard, which took a half a day to find out who the owners were. We do eventually want to get a new house but we are sort of locked in due to high costs and interest rates for the time being. We know our neighbors around us but not familiar with much more of the neighborhood as it is expansive. What are your thoughts on HOAs? Are there areas that have reputable HOAs or are they all a pain? Is there anything the city can do for maintenance of the sidewalks or is that a responsibility of the owner? Mostly I just want to avoid all that dang cheatgrass. Thanks in advance!

"My father has had the Whipple surgery--not due to cancer, but instead a large benign mass in a very bad location. He did very well at first and even gained but had complications 6 months out and is on an even more restricted diet to prevent further issues. 

He is currently on a ""low residue/low fiber"" diet and struggling to keep weight on.

I have to be quick since I'm off to work soon. I'll check back when I'm off this afternoon. Anyways, I'm a 26 year old girl, conservation degree, and I'm really set on moving to CT. I don't have much tying me down here except my job, which is I can manage with. I've done some research and understand that compared to where I'm at now (Minneapolis), there's a higher cost of living out there. I know that's all relative though. Looking around online can only get me so far, so I thought I'd get a more ""personable"" experience asking those who live out there. I had some questions that maybe you could help me out with - 

* Cities/towns/suburbs to look into that may be cheaper to live in (apartments), but are still close to business that will pay well.
* Tips on pursuing an environmental career in CT
* Local resources that help with relocating
* Average cost of apartments, daily living expenses etc. 
* Any other advice you're willing to give is much appreciated

Thanks! Hope everyone is off to a good Friday!

"As I went to vote this past primary, I was notified I was labeled ""u"", and unable to vote that day - but instead I registered again for democractic. To my surprise, but maybe I thought somehow - somewhere I was de registered as a democrat - or that it was my fault. Well, today, along with a few other hundred people who were registered democrats as well, I find my friend who had put a video up on YouTube calling bullshit - as he, and a few other hundred people had been with the same problem and unable to vote in the primary. Along with him, and many others in starting to think this was on purpose. Anyone else run into this problem this past primary Election Day? 

Edit: not first time happening: This was done in person at the town hall for me, I remember specifically because I had missed the checkbox for the parties so then I was given it back and I checked the box.  Which I had done back when I voted in the last presidential election as well, but. I thought somehow voting registration ran out, so I went back to reregister and luckily I did because I wasn't identified as a dem or republican - and thus it still happened, this was less then a year ago. So I'm very suspicious.

"You're all probably sick of questions like this, lol. The secret of your beautiful state becoming more and more known, eager people from all over the country looking to live there. I'm no exception. I'm your typical Midwesterner who swears I'll move south every winter. Now I'm looking to actually do it, if you can bear with me as I try to survive your summers and ask dumb questions. (It all depends on job placement really, but if I were to get the ball rolling, I want to be thinking about it.) 

I'm in my mid-20's, single, outdoorsy, and artsy/crafty. Pretty extroverted. I also like bars, board games, bowling, and casual softball leagues. Just to give an idea of the kind of person I am. I know your state will have a lot to offer in terms of exploring, hiking, experiencing the ocean, seeing the mountains, the whole shebang. 

\-For people in my age range who have moved to North Carolina, how easy was it to meet people and make friends? Any advice on how/where to do that? 

\-Would someone accustomed to a large metropolitan area be happy in a place like Asheville? Or am I bound to get bored there after some time?

\-What about between Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Durham? I know there are college enclaves, but my party days are long over. I'm looking for areas/places that cater to people 25-30 and up. What are the bad areas? What about the wealthy areas, that I should be certain I'll never be able to afford rent in? 

\-What about finding decent places to rent in general? Roommates? Would love to live alone but expensive places make it hard. I'm trying to be vague, but the area I'm currently in has an insane housing market, both buying and renting, and from my understanding NC's is a lot better. Is this true or is the grass just always greener?

\-Are there people here who have moved to NC from the upper Midwest? Did you miss our terrible winters at all? Will I survive the summer, and what should I expect? 

\-For those of you who are annoyed with people trying to move to your state (I get it, I get it), what do you wish they knew? What is there not to love about your state that you would use to dissuade someone from moving there? 

\-I'm sorry for the generalization, but are people in the south truly friendlier? I know it's a giant region with lots of cultural differences. But I've heard you all are way kinder than we are up here (we pretty much ignore strangers/don't interact with each other).

"I am expecting to accept an offer next week in the Triangle and I'm curious about off-roading in NC? I'm from Colorado and used to:

* Narrow trails
* Little to no mud
* Lots of rocks
* Switchbacks up a mountain - usually unknown if it's a real trail or a dead end
* Trails can be 90% something a Civic can do and 10% of the trail you need a Rubicon
* About 10-20% chance you'd ever get reception anywhere in the Rockies off-roading
* I'd say 60-70% trails you need a high clearance 4x4 and 10-15% you need lockers
* Winch can be useless when above the tree-line and our high altitude trees are too thin to hold the weight of most vehicles 
* Full size trucks are handicaped due to size on trails 
* I've definitely had to back down a trail 1000's of feet since I couldn't turn around anywhere

Can someone give me an idea of what vehicle/terrain NC off-roading looks like? Can I get by with a Subaru Outback or do I want a Rubicon? Do I want 42"" mud boggers or some 31"" AT's get me where I need to go? 

Finally will these trails lead to awesome camp sites? Or do they just kinda loop around with a million dirt bikes flying around it endlessly?

"Greetings Chicago redditors! 

Can you help me out? 

This is the third time I’ve stopped at Union Station for a transfer and I am determined to leave the station this time. I have always been afraid to miss my train but I am getting disgusted with myself for not trying...I’ve got the kid with me, and I want to explore even just a little bit of the city today. 

I do have more than 2 hours but we cannot miss our train so I’m calling it 2 hours to err on the side of safety. Our ETA for Union Station is 10:45. Our next train leaves at 2pm. Do we have enough time to cab over from Union station to millennium park, spend a few minutes at each landmark (long enough to see the fountain spit at least one time!!) and make it back without running around like a maniac? 

Are there cabs at Union station? And where should I ask to be dropped off to see the Bean + Fountain? 
Also, would there be cabs around to make it back to Union Station or should I just ask the cab who brings us there to come back in 30/40 minutes? Sorry for so many questions! 

Any tips on how to make this work or if it is even plausible are so very much appreciated. 

Please don’t April Fools me!! Haha

My kid is even more fascinated with Reddit since I told him I could ask for advice on here. “It’s even better than google mom” 
Thanks guys!!!
•••••••••

ETA: we did a fly-by through Millennium Park. Hung around the bean and got some great photos, then walked to the playground which ate up the rest of our time. I was assured we could find a taxi to get back but the area looked so desolate from the park that I still left early to give us time in case we’d have to walk back. Of course we got a cab right away....

My son and I both really loved it!! Thank you so much to everyone for your suggestions and advice. I replied the same in a couple comments below but I guess it bears repeating...we are from NYC and my son is very loyal to and obsessed with where we live. But he kept remarking as we walked around “Chicago is such a better city!” And that “Chicago does everything NY does but better. Except the cold. And the pizza.” 😂

"Hi, I’m Joey Stanley, a linguistics grad student from the University of Georgia doing research on English accents in the US. I did a survey over facebook last year and through another account ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/7c1v7j/casual_english_vowel_sounds_native_english/)) and got several hundred people to take it, but only 4 were from South Carolina. So I thought I'd come here to see if you could help me out.

If you have 5 minutes, please consider taking [this survey](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2lqEd8yULAUDoQB?Q_CHL=social&Q_SocialSource=reddit) about how you say certain words. It is brief (less than 5 minutes) and is open to native English speakers regardless of where you're from. 

Thanks,

Joey

[Edit (May 29): Thank you all for taking the survey! I apologize for not posting the results yet and I know I said I'd get them out by now. I just had an overwhelming number of people take the survey, so it's taking me a lot longer to process, but I do plan on sharing the results soon.

"Does anyone else have to do this? context, I live in a share house and we have a slightly annoying process we have to go through when paying our water usage. 

The real estate agent sends us a letter telling us what we owe and the only payment options are by sending a cheque to the real estate or a money order through Aus post. 

It specifically says we cannot pay via BPAY/DEFT which is how we pay them our rent and is also a much easier process.

Just wanted to see if anyone else has to go through this process to pay for their water usage and if there are any other options?"|sydney|2017|False|0

"I've been selling items on KSL Classifieds for years. I am a private seller. I regularly buy upgraded toys, tools, cars, sports and outdoor equipment, etc. I then sell my old items on KSL to recoup a little money from my upgraded purchase. Over the years I have seen hundreds of scam attempts. I keep wondering why these guys are still at it. The only reason I can think of is chilling, *it's working.*

I don't know who it is working on or how they are getting away with it, because there are some pretty obvious red flags with most all of them. Here are a few of the common ones I see.

>how long have you been using it, Do you bought it new, and why are you selling it, I mean no insult...

>I will like to buy it, but I cant make it there with cash or to check it out,I will pay you through PayPal and the freight company will pick up after you receive payment and do you have PayPal account?

* Poor English
* Say they want to pay via PayPal, Cashiers Check, Money Order or through KSL
* State they want to buy the item at full price without ever seeing it
* Say they will have a 3rd party pick it up

>Kindly get back to [NAME] via email at [NAME0000547t98s5@SOMEEMAIL.com] with your firm price she's interested in buying your [exact item description]

* Email address nobody would actually have
* Asking you to email them, which gives them your personal email instead of using the KSL filter
* Copy/Paste of your exact title, an indication they are mass texting every new item that gets posted
* Phone number is from the other side of the country (not always a sign since people do relocate, but it can be a minor flag)

These are just a couple examples, but most scams follow these basic patterns. They all look different, but there are a lot of similarities. Here are a few rules of thumb that can help out A LOT. These are not all mine, but they are tried and true:

* If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is
* If you wouldn't do it as a buyer, be skeptical of someone else being willing to do it (buy without seeing, paying more than its worth, etc)
* Deal in cash

I would hope that nobody would fall for these scams anymore. If you have additional tips and experience, please share. Good luck out there. Happy selling."|Utah|2017|False|0

It is #14.  I can't identify the artist but apparently it was done in 1992 and presented to John ""Turtle"" Baker, who must have done something special for Hardin-Simmons.  The photos are all the information I have on it.

Come to find out they Do not pay drive time and I couldn't even clock in until we hit the TxDot office in Abilene, so I find out that I am now going to be riding in a company vehicle going to a job for free, two and half hours there and two and half hours back.

I'm a 23 year old Japanese American male and I am going to be studying abroad at Deakin University from July to October. I was curious to know what are some things I should do during my time in Melbourne! I'm open to a lot of things: music fesitvals, food, sports, concerts, etc. 

I was hoping for less touristy things but if you recommend that then by all means! Trying to get the most of my time while I'm visiting. :) I'm also looking to get a tattoo done of some tribal and Japanese style tattoos, so if you know a good shop leave a comment for that too! 

I also have questions for you all:
How is cost of living compared to California? 
Is it hard to find friends being an international student?
If I wanted to sign up for a mobile plan, how much would it be for data and messaging? Any good plans out there?
Recommendations for neighborhoods to live in? (I was looking for nearby campus)

Genuinely curious about this, I knew it was coming but didn’t realize it was coming so quickly. From what little I’ve been able to glean, it sound like it will be run by some sort of joint cooperation between the lottery commission and the casinos? Will you be able to place bets anywhere you buy lottery tickets? Who sets the lines? Are the limits to the types of wagers and sports they are allowing you to bet on? I’ve been to Vegas many times and the sports books there are nuts, seemingly any possible occurrence in any conceivable sporting event, if they can out odds on it, they’ll let you bet on it. I assume it will be at least somewhat more regulated here and not allow for the kinds of crazy prop bets you see elsewhere?|Connecticut|2021|False|0

I have family members looking to relocate to the Huntsville area this fall. They are very concerned with finding a church home similar to where they attend in the Seattle area. They describe themselves as left-wing evangelical. Currently they attend an Evangelical Covenant Church but there aren’t any local churches affiliated with that denomination. Multiethnic, intergenerational, and mission driven would be their most important criteria. Is there anywhere in Huntsville that fits this ideology? They are visiting me in a few weeks and I would like to take them somewhere that might fit their wishes.|HuntsvilleAlabama|2022|False|0

"Hey there,

I’m the person who asked what is was like for trans ppl in South Dakota. Definitely staying away from rural areas, but I think Rapid City should be ok for people like me. I don’t really have a choice in moving haha, so I’ll have to go to SD either way.

Anyways, for people who go to WDT, what’s it like? What programs/majors are you in? How do you like them? Are there other trade schools near Rapid City that you’d suggest?

Any advice would be appreciated :) I’m thinking of going into a construction major/program. I’ve always loved doing stuff hands on and especially building stuff. Ever since I started masonry classes in HS, I’ve been set on going to a trade school. Eventually once I graduate trade school I’m hoping to be a carpenter. Or something like that.

"G’day Again Slagicals,

&nbsp; 

About a fortnight ago, [the r/Sydney community voted for the subreddit to restrict posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/14cwkp9/rsydney_community_protest_vote_results/) in order to protest Reddit’s well-known API changes.

&nbsp;

Reddit continues to fail to negotiate in good faith regarding API access, and have been happy to coerce subreddits to reopen. In particular, [major concerns remain regarding disability access features.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ixy1z/update_on_reddits_plans_for_moderation/) Over 2,400 subreddits remain in a protest state, at the time of writing, including a number of large and location-based subreddits. [r/Sydney’s traffic remains down 75% or more](https://imgur.com/a/8uxeBTw), and if other protesting subreddits experience similar declines, this should be reducing Reddit’s advertising revenues, which we hope shall end up bringing them to the table.

&nbsp;

However, this protest will not keep going without the continued support of the community. As such, we are asking you to vote again on the direction /r/sydney will take next.

&nbsp;

To vote, you’ll need to have at least 500 total subreddit karma, and have created your Reddit account on or before 08/06/2023. This is a measure to ensure that the vote is cast by participants within the r/Sydney community. Naturally, it's one vote per Redditor only.

&nbsp;

The question is:

&nbsp;

Should r/Sydney’s participation in the protest action continue?

&nbsp;

Please vote by responding as a top-level comment with one of the following two words only:

&nbsp;

**Yes** – you want the subreddit to continue to restrict posts, with a Daily Thread open for commentary until 17:00 AEST 15^th July.

&nbsp; 

**No** – you want the subreddit to re-open ASAP.

&nbsp; 

This post shall remain open until 20:00 AEST 30^th June, and results will be announced 17:00 AEST Saturday, 1^st July.

&nbsp; 

AutoModerator will validate and count votes, and remove all comments to keep the secrecy of the ballot. **If your comment includes anything besides the word Yes or No, AutoModerator will not be able to count your vote.**

&nbsp; 

There’s only two positions on this ballot, so majority rules.


&nbsp;

Should the community vote Yes, we shall release another poll asking for the community's stance before 17:00, 15^th July.

&nbsp;

It's sad that we find ourselves in a position where further action needs to continue, but this remains an important issue.


&nbsp;

Stay Slagical,

&nbsp;

The /r/Sydney Mods."|sydney|2023|False|0

"G’day Again Slagicals,

&nbsp; 

As the 48-hour Reddit blackout enters its 6th day, just under 5,000 subreddits continue the protest, and r/Sydney is one of them.

&nbsp;

[While Reddit is unwilling to make reasonable concessions regarding API access, disability accessibility, effective moderation, and research tools,](https://imgur.com/E7jSWf1) many subreddits have chosen to continue protest action. It is clear, for the moment, that Reddit has no intention of negotiating in good faith. [With that said, however, traffic on r/Sydney has declined over 75% since the start of the protest,](https://imgur.com/a/8FFeFbS) [and posts and comments sitewide have taken a hit of approximately 10% based on a graph we’ve seen.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1118623581899853965/1119053784228835411/image.png) It is our hope that declines in traffic will bring Reddit to the table in the near future.

&nbsp;

However, this protest will not continue without the continued support of the community. As such, we are asking you to vote on the direction /r/sydney will take next.

&nbsp;

To vote, you’ll need to have at least 500 total subreddit karma, and have created your Reddit account on or before 08/06/2023. This is a measure to ensure that the vote is cast by participants within the r/Sydney community. Only one vote per Redditor shall be accepted.

&nbsp;

The question is:

&nbsp;

**Should r/Sydney Close (go private) until 17:00 AEST 1^st July, Restrict (with Daily threads open only) until 17:00 AEST 1^st July, or re-Open forthwith?**

&nbsp;

Please vote by responding as a top-level comment with one of the following three words only:

&nbsp;

**Close** – you want the subreddit to go private until 17:00 AEST 1^st July.

&nbsp; 

**Restrict** – you want the subreddit to go restrict posts, with a Daily Thread open for commentary until 17:00 AEST 1^st July.

&nbsp; 

**Open** – you want the subreddit to re-open ASAP.

&nbsp; 

This post shall remain open until 20:00 AEST Sunday, 18^th June, and results will be announced 08:00 AEST Monday, 19^th June.

&nbsp; 

AutoModerator will validate and count votes, and remove all comments to keep the secrecy of the ballot. To assist AutoModerator with this, please only put the word of your vote in your comment.

&nbsp; 

If any position takes a majority of the ballot, it will be declared the winner.

&nbsp;

If no position takes a majority, but votes to “Close” and “Restrict” take a majority of the ballot between them, then “Restrict” shall be declared the winner. This is to prevent vote-splitting amongst those in the community that wants further action taken.

&nbsp;

Should the community vote to ""Close"" or ""Restrict,"" we shall release a second poll asking for the community's stance at 17:00, 1^st July.

&nbsp;

It's sad that we find ourselves in a position where further action even needs contemplation, but this is an important issue.

Much Love,

Your Slagical Mod Team."|sydney|2023|False|0

"A Police officer on Rt 66, stepped into my traffic lane and forced me to pull over. He stated that someone had complained about my driving and would I comply to a sobriety test. IU complied and passed and he said would I comply to a breathalyzer, knowing I had not been drinking( that day in my mind) I complied and blew over on the hand unit - apparently from my previous evenings hard drinking-I was at a celebration until 5 AM - the traffic stop was in the around 2 PM the next day. Ultimately, I was convicted of a DUI 1 for a BAC of .1 or .02 over the legal limit- in January of 2017. I enrolled, prior to my conviction, in a 28 day in house treatment program at the premier facility on the east coast, Ashley, formerly known as Father Martin Ashley (at a cost to me of $50,000.00,)as allowed by Virginia law. Upon completion of my treatment, on the date my case went before the court, I was convicted of a DUI 1 for driving with a BAC of .1 and my lawyer, without informing me of the ramifications, (i.e. once a restricted license is obtained one forfeits the option of simply not driving for a year), obtained for me a restricted drivers license. I was convicted placed on 1 year unsupervised probation and interlock requirement and as required went to ASAP and had a breathalyzer installed. Due to false readings, (the first in the parking lot of the installation, the 2nd 30 minutes later, 8 false positives in the first 6 months), I was violated by ASAP probation near the end of the interlock requirement period, even though 7 were deemed false positives by the commission one lock out was considered legitimate, I assume. I returned to court where the judge found in my favor.- sort of, no fines or jail, but another 6 months interlock. The machine was provided by Alcolock, the Company that was removed from Fairfax counties list of state sponsored interlock providers while it was still in my car, for undisclosed, to the public, reason. I discovered documents on Virginias own site regarding potential rules changes, that it was due the machines not being in compliance with existing VA requirements from the inception of their implementation, and were notorious for giving false readings. I was never given permission to remove the device, however, due in large part due to the issues it gave me, and my ASAP officers inability to schedule me for the 20 required classes for ASAP completion-(she instead made me do 2 different and costly interviews with state sponsored alcohol assessment companies, event though I had preemptively put myself into treatment, and as such had completed that requirement)- I had not been able to work and my car was repossessed. It is worth noting that at my first violation hearing, that even though the judge agreed that it was the machine, imposed no penalty upon me financially, or on a sentence to jail, I was somehow found to be in violation on the interlock issue, and as such, I was required to keep it 6 months Long story short, over the next month there were a couple of false positives - not lockouts, but ""wait 15 minutes and try again"" messages on the unit, and disgusted, unemployed, and despondent, I determined to stop driving until the 6 months was over., I was not informed of violations by my ASAP officer that any violations had occurred and as I was not using the car for the duration of the 6 months imposed upon me at the violation hearing, with the exception of taking the car to the alcolock center for monthly calibration as required by law, when the 6 months were up I called my ASAP officer to inquire about how I could have the unit removed. She got back to me a few days later and ""Sorry I have been ill and out of the office. It appears you had 3 violations which occurred 4 months ago so I am goin to violate you."" I went to court as required in August- the original hear had been continued from June, on the appointed day for the violation hearing but my attorney had a medical emergency (without my knowledge until a month later) and did not show up to the hearing. As covid was roaring through the prisons, and as I , a 52 year old that had almost died of flu/pneumonia/strep lung infection (I spent 40 days in in Reston Hospital isolation ward in Sept/Oct2017) and as such I have lung scaring and am in the age group at higher level of death from covid, there was no way i was going to chance going to jail because my lawyer was not there to defend me and potentially die from a near certain infection of covid. At the second hearing I was found guilty, fined $250 and my restricted license was revoked. My lawyer said pay it and it is over, which I did. However I have now received a letter from DMV telling me I have to do ASAP. AGAIN. I want all of this to end and think mthe original stop should not have been allowed in the first place.

article appended for non-subscribers.

It was true. Viola Allen’s dream home sits atop a nightmare. The city of New Orleans built 67 ranch-style houses on a sprawling former garbage dump in the late 1970s without saying a word to the Black, mostly first-time home buyers who were encouraged to move there by city officials. Under the untreated soil where the new residents planted fruit trees, grew flower gardens and watched their children play in the dirt were 149 toxic contaminants, 49 of them linked to cancer, according to an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The saga of 57 families living on the former Agriculture Street Landfill in the Gordon Plaza housing subdivision is considered by many to be one of the worst examples of environmental injustice in the United States.

The boundaries of the old landfill were certified as a Superfund site in 1994. And now, nearly three decades after residents finally learned they were living on deadly ground, government officials have refused their demand to be relocated from homes that lost their appeal and nearly all of their value. The properties are almost impossible to sell because of the contamination, said Akeem, who was 11 when EPA officials and environmental experts visited his mom that day in 1993.

Even more audacious, lawyers and advocates for the homeowners say, is that after residents were originally awarded a $90 million state court judgment against the city — which approved the construction — officials have refused to pay. The housing authority, which funded the development with federal dollars, and the public school system, which built an elementary school at the site well after the contamination was revealed, have also refused to pay their share of the damages.

An obscure Louisiana law shields municipalities from being forced to pay damages, attorneys said. Earlier this month, a judge reaffirmed a 2006 court decision but agreed with an appellate court’s decision to lower the damages, awarding $75 million to a class of 5,000 plaintiffs. Lawyers said they doubt that the plaintiffs will ever see a dime.

“This case is a living example of the need for environmental justice. And it screams out as an example of environmental racism,” said Suzette Bagneris, the lead attorney for the class.

“The residents of the Agriculture Street Landfill were hard-working, honest folks who worked multiple jobs trying to attain the American Dream of homeownership, only to suffer an American nightmare when the very soil under their homes literally started to kill them.”

It’s yet another challenge that the Biden administration has taken on in its bid to right historic wrongs done to underprivileged communities disproportionately burdened by pollution.

The solution for Gordon Plaza is far more difficult than the successes the administration has achieved so far. Last May, the administration shut down an error-prone oil and gas refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands that dumped oil on people of color. That same month, the administration influenced the city of Chicago to conduct a lengthy environmental impact assessment as officials mulled whether to allow an industrial metal scrapyard to operate in a Mexican American area already teeming with industrial pollution sites. The permit was denied in February.

During his “Journey to Justice” tour in November, EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited Gordon Plaza and spoke with homeowners. They reminded him that his agency was a major part of the problem.

Before the EPA warned Allen and her neighbors that the ground where they raised their families was toxic, it spent nine years telling them it was safe. Between 1986 and 1993, the EPA reassessed how it categorized toxicity of a number of contaminants and finally deemed that the Agriculture Street Landfill site was unsafe.

As federal and local officials stood by, cancer became a fact of life for the people there. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry discovered a breast cancer cluster and reported that Black women in the Agriculture Street Landfill census tract had a 57 percent excess risk of breast cancer over nine years, ending in 1997. More recently, a 2019 report by the Louisiana Tumor Registry found that the census tract where Gordon Plaza sits had the second-highest consistent cancer rate in Louisiana.

It is nearly impossible to link cancer to a toxic substance, so experts could not be definitive about the risk. But residents were terrified.

""Everybody knows somebody in the neighborhood who has cancer and has died from cancer,” said Akeem, who moved away from the area decades ago when he joined the military. He never moved back.

Arsenic and playgrounds

Gordon Plaza was a beacon for Black people who dreamed of owning a home.

Located in a part of New Orleans with a come-hither name, Desire, and a curvy road called Abundance in the Upper Ninth Ward, it dripped with Big Easy charm.

Black people had been excluded from the best neighborhoods by racist housing covenants, redlining and legal racial separation, but this middle-class housing was built especially for them.

As African Americans began to ascend in population and voting power, the city’s White mayor, Victor Schiro, entered into a cooperative agreement with the White-run housing authority in 1967 to plan the new development.

When Press Park apartments and townhomes, a senior living facility, Gordon Plaza and a shopping center were completed in the early 1980s, New Orleans had its first Black mayor, Ernest Nathan “Dutch” Morial.

Morial encouraged his Black constituents, some of whom worked in his own administration, to buy into the dream.

City officials were silent about the bleak history of the 95-acre site selected for construction. But within a few years, the tragic reality became the talk of New Orleans.

Shannon Rainey realized something was wrong in the early 1990s as she dug a hole behind her house to plant a tree. Her shovel struck a solid object.

“I found a canister in my yard, and it had just a skeleton head on it along with the X,” said Rainey, who worked in a city administrative office under Morial and had inside information about the sale of homes in Gordon Plaza. She knew the X stood for crossbones. “Now I’m breathing toxins every day,” she said.

Nate Parker realized something was wrong when he walked out his front door in the early 1990s and saw a white vapor rising from the soil. “In the morning, my dad would walk and he saw smoke coming from off the ground,” said his daughter, Elaine Parker Gavin.

Parker was a “do the right thing” kind of father who coveted homeownership as a financial legacy for his family, Gavin said. With a shopping center and plans for an elementary school, Parker and other residents felt they had no reason to ever leave their all-inclusive community.

Akeem’s voiced cracked as he talked about his adoptive mother’s reaction after she learned of the contamination, and how the news altered their lives. “She never regrouped,” he said. “She always came to us apologizing. She was, like, ‘I’m killing my kids.’”

Akeem was ordered to stop playing in the yard, and his mom had a new daily chore — wiping away household dust with bleach.

A woman who once focused on the positive became an angry crusader. She dragged Akeem to meetings where environmentalists and health consultants warned residents of the possible effects of living on land saturated with poison: neurological disorder, memory loss, stomach ailments and more, Akeem said.

Studies have linked arsenic toxicity to Alzheimer’s disease. “My mom has dementia, the same thing that EPA told them that they can possibly get,” he said.

Then came the tears.

“She doesn’t know who I am. She lives in that same house because she has nowhere else to go.”

Jesse Perkins, born and raised in the Desire Housing Projects, leaped at the chance to buy his first home.

“My mother had never, ever had a home that she actually could call her own,” said Perkins, a retired manager for the city sewage and water board. “So that was everything. I worked so hard, so long, so many hours, day and night, strenuous work, sacrificing and saving my dollars.""

The family planted and ate from a vegetable garden. One day, an environmental activist warned him of the danger. “I knew at that point in time that ... we can’t grow tomatoes here,” Perkins said.

Even Beverly Wright, a professor and environmental expert, was unaware. While she didn’t live at the site, her husband had a pest control contract there.

“I remember him coming home and he would say, ‘Bev, that place is a dump,’” said Wright, founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans.

One day she noticed that his face “had broken out on his forehead with ... little blisters and stuff,” she said. “Even then we did not put it together.”

The swampy 95-acre Agriculture Street Landfill was one of the city’s main resting places for residential and industrial waste. From 1909 until it closed 48 years later, fires constantly erupted. The site was reopened for a year in 1965 to accommodate debris from Hurricane Betsy, up to 300 truckloads per day.

After that the dump was closed, burned, covered with a layer of the city’s incinerator ash and grinded into the earth.

When the homes were built, the foundations were poured onto land with elevated levels of lead, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and arsenic that can cause cancer, heart problems, reduced lung function and developmental problems in children, along with other health disorders.

City officials claimed to have no idea about the extent of the contamination. But after two class-action lawsuits were filed in 1993, and city workers were called to testify for a trial that finally began 12 years later, the depth of their knowledge was revealed.

'An unacceptable risk’

Thousands of people said they were harmed.

Homeowners, cancer patients and children formed one class. Students, teachers and administrators at the Moton Elementary School — which the Orleans Parish School Board built even after consultants explicitly told them the land was dangerous — formed the other.

The classes were joined by Civil District Court Judge Nadine Ramsey. Ramsey did not buy that city officials were unaware of the contamination. In fact, city workers testified that the soil was tested, she wrote.

“As a result...the city required the developer of Gordon Plaza to add topsoil before constructing the homes,” wrote Ramsey. The judge ordered the city to turn over the findings. “The city has never produced a copy of the Gordon Plaza soil testing and has not explained why,"" she wrote.

Before the school board started constructing a school on land it purchased in 1975, its members knew that testing revealed incurable chemical contamination.

At a meeting in 1985, environmental consultants hired by the board advised members “that the site may pose an unacceptable risk of exposure to ... construction crews, schoolchildren and staff,” according to court records.

They recommended excavating three feet of soil at the site and replacing it with at least two feet of fresh topsoil. They also recommended installing a six-to-12-inch clay barrier to separate the topsoil and contaminated soil, and said testing should be routine.

During construction, the clay barrier was eliminated to cut costs. When 900 students entered Moton Elementary in 1986, they lacked that protection.

Wilma Subra, a technical adviser who has worked on numerous EPA Superfund committees, recalled a disturbing experience as she conducted environmental tests at the school.

“You could smell it and feel it,"" Subra said of the toxins, ""on your skin and feel it in your lungs.”

In her scathing judgment, Ramsey described the behavior of city officials as “shocking,” and said the school board’s actions were “particularly offensive and egregious because of its heightened duty in the realm of elementary schoolchildren.

The residents, ""who are some of the most unrepresented in our society, put their trust in the defendants,” who “did nothing as evidence mounted that the former landfill was hazardous.”

Two months after the trial began, Ramsey ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding $90 million in damages. Each person was to receive up to $50,000 for mental stress.

A core group of plaintiffs received up to $105,000 for the diminished value of their homes due to “the stigma associated with being located directly on top of a Superfund site,” court records said.

Viola Allen was awarded $140,000, and Nate Parker was granted $145,000. Another homeowner, Don Harrison Lewis Sr., was awarded $105,000 for lost property value. Diarra Ayodele McCormick, one of hundreds of Moton students, was awarded $40,000.

City officials appealed the decision to the state Supreme Court, which upheld most of the award. But as the city, housing authority and school board ignored the courts, disaster struck.

Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans, drowning the Ninth Ward, including Gordon Plaza, in more than six feet of floodwaters. Residents scattered as far away as Australia.

While they were gone, the Press Park apartments and the senior center were demolished, leaving only Gordon Plaza. Homeowners hoped disaster insurance would end their ordeal, but insurers would not buy homes built on contaminated ground.

Ten years passed before Bagneris and her legal team forced the housing authority’s private insurers to pay a sliver of what it owed in 2015: $14.2 million.

It was a small victory.

Later that year, a New Orleans Times Picayune reporter interviewed Joan Virgil Davis as she opened her court settlement letter. Davis had played in the dirt at Press Park when she was a child. Over 20 years, she fought breast, brain, lung and rectal cancer.

“I watched her go from a woman who walked like a stallion to one who had to be pushed in a wheelchair,” Rainey said.

She unfolded the letter and looked at her reward: $4,843.15.

A year later, Davis died, according to her Boyd Family Funeral Home obituary. She was 59.

'It’s death over there’

By the time Regan, the EPA administrator, stepped out of his black government SUV and took a seat in a circle of residents on Rainey’s front yard, Gordon Plaza’s residents had little faith in government.

But they patiently told their story — including the part about how the EPA misled them.

It started in 1986, when the EPA conducted soil tests at the former landfill. The results were not provided and residents were told the land was safe, court records said.

Later, after the federal toxic substance disease registry found elevated levels of lead and other chemicals, the EPA returned. A second round of tests in 1993 found that 149 toxic contaminants were dangerous.

A majority of residents asked to be relocated. But rather than pay an estimated $12 million for that, the EPA spent $20 million to remediate the soil, swapping a three-foot layer of contaminated dirt for clean dirt in just 10 percent of the development.

Adding to what residents considered an insult, the EPA told homeowners, senior citizens and schoolchildren that it was safe to go about their normal lives when contractors started digging and kicking up enormous clouds of dust.

The workers showed up wearing gas masks and hazmat suits.

“I can remember it like it was yesterday,” Jesse Perkins said. “They were looking like astronauts.”

Outraged, Perkins was one of many homeowners who refused to let contractors touch his property, fearing the dust they created would sicken his family. He believes every level of government — federal, state and local — failed him.

That included Morial, the first Black mayor who rode into office on the votes of a new Black voting majority.

Years later, Marc Morial and Mitch Landrieu, the sons of mayors who governed when the development was new, expressed sympathy for Gordon Plaza residents after becoming mayors themselves. Meanwhile, city lawyers fiercely fought the residents in court and refused to pay damages during their terms.

Mitch Landrieu, now the infrastructure czar for President Biden, did not respond to requests for comment. Marc Morial, president and chief executive of the National Urban League, a civil rights group, said the neighborhood was divided over the relocation effort.

“I’m saying that community leaders right back in the day said we don’t favor a buyout because we don’t want the neighborhood to be destroyed,"" said Marc Morial, whose eight years in office ended in 2002.

The vast majority of residents supported relocation, Bagneris said. Morial eventually supported a relocation, she said, but only after the EPA informed him that the city would be responsible for the $20 million it cost to repair the soil.

Subra said the relocation effort was undermined by the city’s vigorous court fight and hostility toward the EPA. Residents came to share the hostility when the EPA chose to spend $20 million to remove soil, but not people.

Sitting in the sun with Regan, the second African American administrator in EPA history, they wondered what he could do.

The bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress provided $3.5 billion to clean up Superfund sites, and the EPA is now considering another round of soil testing that could finally lead to a relocation.

Regan promised to consider the residents’ demand to be relocated, saying he would consult with Mayor LaToya Cantrell — one in a long line of Black mayors who have expressed sympathy for the residents while fighting them in court. Cantrell declined to comment.

The City Council recently voted to set aside $35 million in the capital budget for Gordon Plaza, but the money is not guaranteed.

For some people who lived in Gordon Plaza, any potential rescue is much too late. Parker Gavin, who moved to Mississippi years ago, said she will never go back.

"Company Name: Labor Loading Hauling Moving and More

My review is longer than Google's 4000 character limit so I'm posting it here. 

Move from Louisville to Radcliff 

I intentionally waited 48 hours to write this review because I was so pissed I wanted time to calm down. However, after playing the whole situation over and over in my head for the past 48 hours the conclusion is that I'm still pissed the FO! 
Secondly I want to comment that in order to be a successful business owner, you must listen to your customers feedback and retrospect. These is one of those moments.
I contacted Dre to get a quote on moving. I told him all of the large items and approximate boxes that needed to be moved. Initially I was going to split the move into two bc half of this 3100 sq.ft house was going in storage. 
Items:
A total of 3 couches and 1 recliner,
1 King bedroom group
1 Queen bedroom group
1Twin bedroom group
1 dresser for the baby
1 Futon
2 desks (one of them a sit-to-stand)
A six cubby hole bookcase
A 3 cubby hole book case
Random wall art (didn't provide the count)
20-40 boxes (turned out to be 44)
And other a couple small mics furniture pieces. 
Mentioned my son's toys and his little kitchen.
A back patio table
A 3 story ferret cage (cleaned)
A charcoal grill (cleaned) 
There were some other smaller mics moving items but this is the gist of it. 
Anyway Dre proceeded to explain his rates one of them.beimg $145/hr for 3 men (pretty high but I thought to myself they've gotten five stars so far...must be worth it) 

Day of move:
I got a text at 10:23am that he was 13 minutes away. Once there I started walking him through the house. Starting with the garage I told him everything that's labeled yellow is storage...90% of storage items were already in the garage ready to go. The bigger furniture items weren't. 
As I was walking.him through the house he started making comments about how I didn't tell him about everything. I was a bit taken by this because I'm a very thorough person...I literally labelled everything in the house to be moved... everything. 
But I didn't want to get off to a bad start so I let it go (1st mistake). 

They got started around 10:55am. 
He said he didn't think we could get everything on the truck. So I asked if I needed to get a 2nd truck...could go to Uhaul but I'd need someone to drive it...he said no problem. 
About an hour in, one of his guys got a terrible phone call that someone close to him had passed. The poor guy just broke down and it was challenging for him to focus. I asked if he needed to take off...we could try to work around it and go from there. But Dre insisted his guy would be okay. I left to get the Uhaul...ended up getting a 17' truck. Returned home and the guy told me he needed to leave...he didn't have a way home so I called/paid for an Uber for him. Cause that's just the type of person I am. The Uber arrived around 12:30 and the guy went home. So now we're down to 2 people instead of 3. Dre said his uncle was on his way...cool.
But in the meantime we started helping to move stuff because I needed to be out of the home before the cleaning people came. And being down one person makes a big difference. 

Okay so his uncle finally arrived and by this time we have about an hour before cleaners arrive. So myself and S/O who has a nerve injury hustled along with Dre and the young lady he brought to move boxes and smaller items. But I noticed that his uncle was kind of slow...but I thought maybe he's just not used to the work and was just helping his nephew out. 

Alright so trucks loaded and we're about 13 minutes passed the time we needed to be out. There were just a few stragglers behind but surely I could get those if they left with the trucks and I catch up with them on the road...wrong! 

Dre then told me that nobody felt comfortable driving the Uhaul. It was pretty much like sorry one of us (me or s/o) would have to drive the uhaul. At that time I'm like WTF...we needed our vehicles to move those straggler items so the cleaners could clean without stuff in their way. 

Dre and his crew left and me and s/o took about 20 minutes to try and figure out WTF to do. Bottomed line was we would have to come back to Louisville and things really started to go south there. 

By the time we left, we got caught in 30 minutes of traffic...you'll see where I'm going with this. I drove the Uhaul while the s/o took the pets and baby in the SUV.

By this time Dre and his crew had about a 50 minute lead on us. 

When I was 10 minutes from the destination in Radcliff I get a call from Dre asking where the place was. My immediate thought was how did we catch up with them when they had a 50 minute lead???

At any rate, they got into the house and started unloading. When I got to the house 10 minutes later my family and I start unloading the 2nd truck (Uhaul). 
But as I'm taking stuff into the house I'm noticing that the uncle was constantly taking ""breaks"" while everyone else was moving things in. I even watched the facial expression from the young lady that was moving the boxes like 'dude wtf are you doing?' 
My sister-in-law arrived...great we have more help. But as we are moving things in we're just looking like WTF...this guy is not really helping. He's standing around and talking a lot!! 

Fast forward, we got done and headed to the storage which was 4 minutes away. 
We let them in storage and they unload while we run to the bank and get some food. When we got back they were pretty much done (6:45pm) then that's when all hell broke loose. 

The price I was quote had almost trippled. 
I nearly lost it and asked how? Dre said 9 hours...I'm 10:45-6:45 isn't 9 hours it's actually 8 and it would've gone a lot faster but we were down a man for almost two hours then the uncle who came to replace was barely doing anything mutha@#$&en thing!!!!!!! 
I said.you know we've had some unforeseen situations...he said like what? 
I'm thinking WTF!!!! So I had to remind him that we lost his first guy, and started helping to get done and how his uncle stood around. Then he said his uncle took a quick break...he can't take a break?
Okay so I will admit I lost it. I literally lost my temper because I was being played! I couldn't believe it. I thought surely as a business owner you should be mindful of these things. But nope. 
The argument got pretty intense and I realized nothing was going to change and that I was going to end up taking this loss. 
He made some eff'd up comment about how we would've broken our backs moving stuff if they didn't help and insulted my s/o size. Im like the &$## do you think we got all that furniture in our home originally? No one helped us. Lol
In addition to that my daughters and myself have literally moved our entire household from State to State by ourselves with no help from a man what so mother@#$en ever!!! 

So why did I decide to hire movers this time? Uhh let's see I have a tumor in my left shoulder and like I said my s/o had nerve damage in his arm. But we had to move sh!t anyway!!

It all ended badly, I was appauled that Dre couldn't admit the situation was wrong and was so on the defense without listening to what his customers were saying. 

I almost left without paying...but that's not how I do business...that's not who I am
So I took the loss, paid and left. 
Oh and those cleaners that was supposed to clean my house said they couldn't clean bc the stragglers behind. So that pretty much ruined the rest of my weekend.. photographer was supposed to come on Friday, house put on the market, open house on Sunday...all...not... happening. 
So I really got screwed. Dre sent a text apologizing how things had ended but at this point I didn't give a @#$&. He got my $50 deposit, $1491 plus I paid $30 to get his first guy home. (I was originally quoted $628.)
I got completely...100% F@#$ed!!!!!!

Never a mother@#$&en again will I hire a ##$en mover!!! I...a woman have done this sh!t many times before with no help. This was a useless waste if time and money.

So yeah this was a very long post but I want you all to have all of the details. 
I'm not going to give a one star review and not tell the real story. 

Beware...if you're paying $145/hr make sure every last own of them are working. I'm too nice...thinking the whole time Dre would make this right but not everybody is like me. So there's that."|Louisville|2019|False|0

So my question is, do y'all consider yourselves a part of the south? Is Missouri southern too?? 
I don't really know much about Arkansas, so I was a bit surprised to hear the accents with a drawl in the movie. Now, growing up, I was left under the assumption that the southern states (cultural-wise) were: Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, (northern) Florida, South Carolina, and some parts of Texas. Now I'm all confused as to what states actually share southern culture and what states don't. Where is the line drawn? I know that the Civil War isn't a good guide for it, as Arizona was a Confederate territory but isn't a southern state. If any of y'all have a list of states that are considered southern by their culture, that would help me so much. Thanks!

"So I work for a public school and this stupid voucher plan is making my coworkers and myself mad. We got to talking about how unfair it was to give private schools any state money, considering they are allowed to refuse to enroll Special Ed kids and don't have to deal with 504s and IEPs. Well one of my coworkers brought up the point that by taking state money, they are now subject to state and Federal civil rights law. 

If they refused to enroll someone who had a disability, or wasn't the right religion, that would amount to state sponsored discrimination. In my mind, this situation would fall under Burton v Wilmington Parking authority, where the SCOTUS ruled that a coffee shop and a state parking garage had a close symbiosis making the state government a joint participant in discrimination.

"Synopsis:

The new case average dropped considerably again today and has passed below 1000 for the first time since Oct 10th. This seems largely spurred by a significant drop in new tests. 30-day lows were set across the board again: 7-day New Case Average, 7-day Average Positivity, and Active Cases.

https://preview.redd.it/hu4fobns0be61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26464180f9b643d41ed337a820aea01914154aa

After a glitch last week, the percentage of new tests is pretty standard for a Friday (20.7% today vs 17.6% last week and \~20% the two weeks before), and the positivity continued to decline (5.8% today vs 6.3% last week.)

https://preview.redd.it/sn7yghyt0be61.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e88980fad1057f869b679af97e11ca53efade5

New tests decreased a whopping 21.7% since last Friday, but still outperformed new cases (down 28.6% in that same timeframe.) As a result, the 7-Day Positivity Average dropped down to another new 30-day low (down 0.07% since yesterday and down 0.59% since last Friday) to 6.3%. The 7-Day average for new cases is now down only 13.5% from where it was a week ago but the 7-Day average for testing is only down 5.3% in that same time. 

https://preview.redd.it/00ebe47v0be61.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb0a037ebbd957b4647f8716bc9bd3e7eed7f2c

Due to the number of new cases dropping considerably relative to last week, the 7-day average new case rate dropped 55 to \~970/day. The 7-day new tests average also dropped by almost 700 and is now \~16600/day.

After the lull last week in the downward trend, it seems to have to have resumed with strength and is now dropping considerably faster than I would have expected. It’s unfortunate to see that there are considerably less tests being performed, but that could just be a result of less people seeking testing since there are now less people getting sick. As I mentioned in a comment yesterday, I see no sign of there being difficulties in getting a test if you want one. The positivity rate also continues to drop, and this implies that we are not having issues with too little testing."|Iowa|2020|True|1

"My actual confession is at the end, but I think I should put it into context. So, let me give you some background:

I'm a 22-year old Mexican guy, living in Mexico, although I am *somewhat* well-traveled and I generally know what's up with the world.

I love to learn how things work, to reason, and to ponder. I'm very skeptical and I don't usually let emotions get on my way when assessing the truth of things. To illustrate this, I am the only atheist in my family even though I'd like my former religion (Mormonism, the religion I was raised in) to be true.

Now, let's leave that aside for a second and let me tell you a story: 

I had some issues with Mexican bureaucracy that prevented me from getting accepted into any High School in the country, so my best chance to study was to go to the U.S., where I had some relatives. In retrospect, it was a brave decision, as I spoke no English at the time.

I arrived in Utah and spent my High School years there. Long story short, I thrived academically in a way that I had never thought possible. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that all I had needed all along was a little (and I mean very little) guidance that neither my parents nor Mexican schools had been able to provide. Soon, I was a fully independent learner, diving into science, literature and Mathematics all by myself. Pretty cool!

As you can guess, my High School years were a time of deep introspection.

My inquisitive mind inevitably ended up thinking about the concept of human race. I always suspected (slightly) that the differences between human races were not skin-deep, but I wasn't sure.
Sure enough, I did my own research, read a lot of scientific studies, observed people of different races and ethnicities, and suddenly the conclusion that races aren't truly equal seemed inescapable, even though I wanted them to be.

Next, I wanted to know how that knowledge applied to myself. ""what is my racial makeup?"" I asked myself.
I thought about my family members, which look, in general, mostly (and please notice the word ""mostly"") European, while only one or two look fully European.
Still, I am from a country of Mestizos, so it wouldn't be surprising if I had some indigenous blood.

Since I hadn't taken a DNA ancestry test, I didn't have a lot of trustworthy information about it, but, hey!, fun fact: the Mormon church encourages its members to do genealogy, and it has the largest genealogy library in the world, so I didn't need to start from scratch, because my mom had done a lot of genealogy. I looked at my ancestry records and found all my ancestors supposedly traced all the way back to Europe, mostly Southern. BUT I later found out that some important records were altered, so there's a lot of missing information, and some of my relatives have subtle, suspiciously exotic facial features, so I couldn't delude myself: there was a chance that I wasn't completely white, especially when comparing myself to white Utahns. I compared myself to them and I felt pathetic.

Oh, yeah, white Utahns...Let me talk a little bit more about them.

I admire white Utahns. They are some of the most intelligent people I've ever met. They are some of the most valuable manpower in the world. Their home state is very safe and ranks sky-high on human development. Also, they have created a very important tech hub in the area, from scratch, with only two and a half million people. TWO AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE! Can you imagine that?
Not only that, but they look tall, blond, healthy, and plain majestic to me. I'm certainly not exaggerating when I say that I had a MASSIVE crush on every other girl I met there.

I should probably mention that they actually accepted me in their group. This is very significant, because Utah is a place where racism is very much alive. They usually wouldn't give Mexicans the time of the day. They would be superficially nice to them then speak ill behind their backs...but they wouldn't do that to me. I was different and they made it very clear with their attitudes, and those pretty, blonde girls would actually give a damn about me!

When I am socializing with white people, I feel an instant chemistry, a bond, a kinship. I rarely feel like an outsider. The interaction just feels very natural, and it is a feeling I rarely get when interacting with people of other races. It's really strange, since I'm technically not part of them. The only other comparable race in this regard are North-East Asians, kind of; and I don't really think it's a cultural thing. My perception is that some patterns of behavior are linked to biology and they become evident if you dig deep enough, regardless of culture. To me, it's like comparing a Pitbull with a Poodle: they can be trained similarly but you can't suppress their biology.

Anyway, Utah turned me into a different person, for the better, in every single aspect of my life. Wow!

The above wasn't really clear to me until I moved back to Mexico, got my life in order, and enrolled in an Engineering program at a Mexican university. After all, how bad could it be? When I embarked on my intellectual journey about race-related topics, I surely must have been overestimating the differences. Mexicans couldn't be that bad, since all of my best childhood memories took place in Mexico. Right?

Turns out my trust was misplaced. Studying at a Mexican university was one of the most disappointing and eye-opening experiences I've ever had. The education is a joke, the laboratory equipment rarely works even though there is a LOT of money to fix it (yeah, they blatantly steal the money), teachers are extremely condescending to students, leaders artificially inflate student statistics to make the university look good, and students only care about money and have no qualms about cheating their way through life.
Also, I got to have the experience of feeling like an alien...again. I mean, Mexicans have been warm to me as they are to everybody, and obviously I'm very familiar with Mexican culture, but I still felt like an alien.

It became even clearer when I spent a year abroad in Europe (did I mention that I got my life in order after living in Utah, making it possible to achieve anything I set my mind to, including going on an exchange?).
I got a glimpse of many cool Engineering projects that are being developed there. Once again, I felt like I was truly in contact with my creative side. Once again I felt like people was sane.

I'm back in Mexico again, working on a project to help the country, as agreed when I was awarded the scholarship to study abroad, but I simply can't picture myself living here over the long term. I will get a job abroad and get out of here as soon as I can.
It makes me sad that I have to do this. Mexico is an insanely wealthy country; a true goldmine, and I now understand that the real problem are the people who inhabit it.

Now, my actual confession:

I really, REALLY love white girls, especially Caucasian, blonde girls from Northern European stock. Seriously. The sole thought of being in a relationship with one of them (given that we are actually compatible, of course) makes me very happy; and, much to my surprise, I stand a very good chance.

I don't think I'm being superficial. I already told you what I think. If you think I'm being superficial, I suggest you read my thoughts again.
I have met many such girls of different cultures (Netherlands, Germany, Norway...both urban and rural) and I stand by my words.

Soon I'm going to take a DNA ancestry test via 23andme, and I'm terrified of the possibility of not being white enough. I don't want to know the results.
Now, don't get me wrong. My relatives are all very smart people. They are above-average entrepreneurs, Engineers, doctors, etc., so I have good genes, but if I turned out to have a sizable percentage of non-white in me, I would hate myself for polluting such a fine gene pool, which is already threatened.

That's my secret, and this is probably the only thing where my emotions trump my reasoning, because I want it bad enough. 

So, what are your (insightful, preferably) thoughts on this? I really want your honest thoughts. If you'd rather not post your opinion under your real account, I guess you could create a throwaway one.

"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao.

How is it being non-white in AK? I (white guy) grew up in the Deep South and have experienced out in the open for racism down there many times through my childhood (towards friends, family, etc). That kind of racism is easy to see and is known. Having lived in a small foothills community in CO for over a decade know I have noticed more subtle forms of racism…people being threatened by people of color wanting to meet up for hiking groups (community members claiming reverse racism for simply wanting to connect with people of color in an overwhelmingly white community). I’m hoping to gather from Alaskans what life is like for people of color in larger communities (Fairbanks specifically) and smaller as well. from the outside looking in it seems like community is such and important part of life in AK and the reality  of living in such an extreme place may get people past looking at skin color as such a dividing aspect of life. My SO is a Mexican/Spanish woman and just would like to get a pulse on how that might affect her from a cultural perspective of the state if we were to relocate their eventually. I grew up lucky enough to get to travel around Alaska fishing and hunting with my father and your state has always had my heart.

"Hi all, looking to take a big Alaska vacation in May!  My fiancé and I are heading up from May 11-18 to celebrate our birthdays.  We were planning on flying into Anchorage, renting a car for the week, driving north to Trapper Creek area for three nights to explore the Denali region and do some hiking.  After that we plan to head to Kenai peninsula for four nights and this is where we are seeking advice.  We were advised by a friend that Seward and Homer are must sees.  Problem being, they are 3 hours drive apart which would be a little too far to stay in one and take a day trip to the other.  

Would you recommend one of Seward or Homer over the other?  Should we look to stay in the middle somewhere (Soldotna, Kenai, Sterling) and take day drives to both spots?  Am I thinking too much like a lower 48er- is it possible to catch a flight between the two towns for a day trip?

We love hiking and fishing, looking to see some wild life (fiancé has yet to see a wild moose, its on her bucket list), maybe a sight seeing flight, would love to catch a charter boat out of Homer for some halibut.  Would also love to catch a boat tour of the Kenai glaciers / Fjords.  Thank you all in advance!"|Alaska|2024|False|0

"I am currently residing in a state with uncertain economical outcomes. Without getting into details, the state's overall policies, investments, and changes in their economy do not seem promising in the long term for further investing. It's a sunk cost.

I'm considering alternatives and Carolinas are one option as I'm drawn to southern climates as well. However after researching, I'm not seeing a lot on growth data or potential future industries. I figured it's skewed to my lack of knowledge (local knowledge problem) and so I would appreciate the honest opinion form those who reside in this area. What are your opinions on the prospects and future growth for SC? 

I'm really torn on NC or SC but want SC due to the climent but only if I can plant seeds worth investing long term. INdustry specifics? What's the trend or emerging industries? Also which cities should I look into for more growth opportunities?

I did a survey over facebook last year and through another account ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/7c1v7j/casual_english_vowel_sounds_native_english/)) and got several hundred people to take it, but only 4 were from South Carolina.

Thanks,

"We've been renting this place for 2 years now, renewing yearly. The lease will end around New Year's, but the property manager started asking in September (about 4 months in advance to the lease end!) whether we plan to renew. 

Yes we do, but she kept asking for how long and at what price. [Realestate.com.au](http://Realestate.com.au) and similar sites only show availability 6 weeks in advance; that will be mid-November. So we're over 2 months too early to get an idea of the market. I said so, but she keeps pushing. I proposed a 6 month renewal for the current price, she wants a higher price for 12 months. It starts to look on the higher side of current prices, but OK I guess to avoid the cost of moving. 

So I'm wanting to tell her that we're OK in principle with that offer, but we won't sign anything until mid-November when we can actually start to check the market, and to please piss off until then. 

**My question is:** how come they get so pushy *so early*? Can they do anything to force us to decide so early? I *imagine* they could get petty and somehow decide they don't want to renew us, but I *hope* that, just like the process of moving would be costly and uncomfortable for us, it would also be some friction for them, right? 

Even, is there anywhere I could complain about this pressure?

For context, this PM has always been starting the renewal process early and I always have had to push back a bit; last year it was 3 months early. But this is getting silly. 4 months!"|brisbane|2024|False|0

"My partner and I eat out a lot. Moo moo, Walters, Fatcow, Boatshed etc. 2 or 3 times a week. The Norman when we have the kids.

We’ve dined at black hide 20 or 30 times, and with the treasury gold membership we enjoyed the 30% off.

The new black hide is such a let down. The wine list sucks. Only a few Barossa Shiraz, in fact like 5 Shiraz only on the list.  Nothing aged, no middle range. One torbrek but out of stock. Anything over $1k is a grange or HOG.

Sides, ok but fat cow is complementary.

"Has anyone dealt with renovating an old building in Montana?

We bought a building built in 1909 that has been used consistently but not kept up very well. It hasn't looked good for probably 60 years. Our goal is not to create luxury apartments or anything, just make the space useful and affordable. 

When applying for a federal grant to help cover some of the costs, we had to report to SHPO. Unless we follow their stipulations, we aren't eligible for the federal grant funding. Unfortunately, the cost of period-appropriate windows and fixtures would make the original grant funding moot. If we chose to stick with the funding and be subject to their regulations, we'd need to raise rent cost, which goes against our values. Housing is tough here and our hope is to make it easier to live here, not more difficult. We are probably going to withdraw from the grant entirely, but now we're on their radar and they are pushing to put our building on the historic registry.

How much involvement can we expect from them? This is not a famous building and has looked abandoned (even though it wasn't) for a very long time. Is this going to slow down an already arduous task? Thanks for any input.

If it matters, we are not out-of-state investors or anything. We were born and raised in this small town and are working on this building as a way to invest in our community."|Montana|2023|False|0

" This is part of an email Mike Rounds sent to me today. What he is trying to do is convince you that while he has some control over 'discretionary spending' he has no say in the funding of Social Security and Medicare; he 's trying to fool you into giving him just that, the ability to cut both these programs. You gotta' read between the lines of the fine print!

""Background brief for the next question: The federal government spent $4.8 trillion on mandatory spending programs in Fiscal Year 2021. This includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and paying the interest on our debt. Furthermore, the federal government spent $1.6 trillion on what is termed discretionary spending, which includes defense spending and the rest of the operations of government. While Congress votes on the defense and non-defense discretionary portions of the budget, the spending on the mandatory programs is not actively managed by Congress and does not get voted on through our annual appropriations process.

""Were you aware that over 70% of annual U.S. federal spending is considered ""mandatory spending"" that Congress does not vote on?""

"Yesterday evening I got a phone call offering me a great deal on DirecTV. Several factors made me suspicious.

(1) I never get ""legitimate"" telemarketing calls on my cell phone, not counting companies I already do business with. (2) The caller had a strong accent which I think I'd call Middle Eastern. Such accents can come from legitimate calls, so that was a minor factor, just mentioning it for completeness. (3) The caller ID showed my local exchange (Kingston). That's the big one, since DirecTV doesn't have offices in Kingston, and scammers love to spoof local exchanges. Hardly anyone in Kingston has a Middle Eastern accent.

I decided a couple of sentences in that this had to be a scam call and blew off the caller. A Web search shows that scam calls impersonating DirecTV are common. Just one more thing to be cautious of when answering the phone."|NewHampshire|2019|False|0

"I rented a kayak on Eagle Creek last fall, definitely looking to go again. Only had one complaint. The trash. The reservoir is full of floating litter. I happened to have a plastic bag on me with snacks and sunscreen that I emptied into my backpack and used it to collect trash. Gave me an idea maybe eagle Creek could use. What if they issued a small trash bag along with the kayak and if you came back with it reasonably full of trash you got $5 off your rental. Wouldn't cost them much in $, the lake would get a ""free"" cleaning from visitors making it nicer for the environment and guests. Just a thought.

"Hey fellow Hoosiers, I'm wanting to see about getting some choir singers together for a video. I wanted to put together a video for a song. Would definitely like to get some people who have some musical backgrounds and play instruments, can shoot a video, etc. Shoot me a comment and/or a pm if you are interested. 

The basic outline of my idea is forming a fun group of people who love music and would like to collaborate in making a song, or songs, that really highlight genres of music across the board and use it as a platform to really display everyone's individualistic talents accompanied by others to help better convey each person's story through their song. 

My first thought is doing something that has a lot of reverb, something good like a church, but maybe like an abandoned building or something. A choir but seeing how we can play with it and incorporate other types of music in it to make something beautiful. 

It's just a thing to do, not a paid promotion or anything, but if you love music, are bored, and want to try something new in your life, now's the time to do it. I'd also love for anyone who'd be willing to assist me in working all this out. If you are a pro at scheduling and organizing things, hit me up. 

Lastly, all credit would be given to the group in the videos, and I'd plan to upload it on the web of course as well.

"Okay. My wife and I were near the Meijer on Carmel Drive and we saw this... thing. It kind of looked like [this](https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photo-velomobile-bicycle-car-recumbent-bike-modern-streamlined-vehicle-uses-human-power-to-travel-image40753605), but the wheels were totally covered and the top was closed in like the rest of it - we had to drive past it twice to confirm through the tiny windows that someone was in it, since we initially thought it was, like, a self-driving car or something. 

I would normally assume it's just a recumbent bike with a body kit or something. But this thing was going decently fast at a sustained rate - like 35mph(?) maybe. I passed it pretty easily in my car both times but it wasn't being disruptively slow, like a bike would be. 

Any idea? Again, this was over right by the Meijer on Carmel drive - the guy in it was heading towards the roundabout at Pennsylvania. This will drive me crazy until I get an answer, and I hope to god one of you know what I'm talking about.

was wondering if anyone would know any good 2-3 day hikes. I'd prefer 2 days since my friends have a bit of time restrictions this holiday but open to hear anything you guys might be able to suggest!

I was originally going to take them on the southern-eastern wilsons prom hike that's shy of 40km in about 2.5-3 days which i've done before quite comfortably. Knowing this anything around that difficulty might be good as one has never been hiking/camping before and isn't too fit. 

Also would be great if they're scenic for some nice photos :)

"This is probably not the right place to post this, but I am not sure where to start. In 1979, I was born in South West Harbor, Maine. My family lived in what was known as the Dicky Butler House. Apparently, this house had the negative, evil, bad reputation. Kids would always cross the street and run away from the house. My mom and dad asked around town as to the history behind the house, but people basically refused to discuss the topic. Even for years later, after we moved to Portland when we would run into people from SWH we would mention the Dick Butler House and we would be met with some weird faces, and they would avoid discussing the topic.

"I'm relocating to Maine, and I'm wondering what [M.B.A.R. 11A(a)(2)](https://mainebarexaminers.org/reciprocal-admission/qualifications/) means by the phrase, ""**active practice of law**,"" in the following excerpt:

In order to be qualified for admission by motion pursuant to Maine Bar Admission Rule 11A, an applicant must meet the following criteria:
Has been primarily engaged in the **active practice of law** in one or more United States jurisdictions (which may include the active practice of law in the State of Maine to the extent permitted by Rule 5.5(d) of the Maine Rules of Professional Conduct) for at least three (3) of the five (5) years immediately preceding the date upon which the motion is filed.

To clarify, I began working under a practice order in my current jurisdiction about a year before I was admitted to the bar. I basically was allowed to perform all the functions of an attorney, as long as I was supervised while in court.

Do the Maine Bar Examiners consider ""active practice of law"" to simply mean ""admitted to practice in a jurisdiction,"" or do they take other factors into account as well?"|Maine|2017|False|0

 Not sure how these restaurants call what they serve soul food. In the 30 years since I move here with my family. I've had people over the years recommend different place around Georgia, where they had lunch or dinner. I've visit a few over the years, only to be disappointed. Which bring me too my lates search for soul food this particular restaurant has been in business for over 20 years. My order Salmon never had a piece of dry salmon 1 inch high. AND I didn't know they serve it over rice. The rice was soggy, collard greens, not my mother greens and sweet potato souffle which had too much cinnamon. I've cooked everyday over the year raising the kid's, family holidays. so i know my way around the kitchen. my husband and i yes, we are part of the baby boomer. he tries to get me to stop cooking and join the let's go out and eat crowd.

So I am active duty military, I recently was in a situation where I needed to drive my back up vehicle which did not have an up to date registration or up to date insurance. long story short I was pulled over and given a ticket for both of those and let go with a court date of January 10th. I have a Washington state license which I have had for my entire 15 years of military service with no issue. Yesterday I was pulled over for speeding in a separate vehicle that was fully legal to drive. The Officer however was not understanding that I did not need a Georgia license in order drive in Georgia as active duty military so she proceeded to arrest me and take me into jail which I just bailed myself out of. Was this a legit arrest or should I be hiring a lawyer for false arrest. The only thing I am concerned about is the temporary license number that is given to you if you receive a ticket in Georgia which I have looked up multiple times and have no way of seeing any information online. my current Washington license is not suspended or revoked I have checked this multiple times including from a police officer to verify. I am wondering if this default license number that was given to me is somehow suspended or revoked or something without me knowing or having a way to figure out online. |Georgia|2023|False|0

Personally I’ve been to Ace Hotel twice, which is open to non-guests, $20 entry but the money goes towards  food/drink and it’s really nice and clean so definitely a good spot to float some beers.

I’ve also been to the drifter hotel a few times for various DJ events. Definitely a mixed bag- usually a cover, overcrowded on weekends, pool water gets pretty filthy I’ve only dared it once, but the toptional views and regular house music DJs are attractive poolside vibes. 

Would love to hear y’alls tips for getting wet this summer. I know some of the hotel pools like W and Meridian don’t open to public until Labor Day.  I also don’t have any ethical qualms with crashing the private/hotel pools. Here’s an article from curbed, if y’all have any input or experience I’d love to hear it.

"Hoping there are some opinions here, or someone who has experienced similar.

Just finished up at a rental place, during the rental period one copy of a front door key got bent (which I then threw out). 

The rental agency are saying since I can't return the exact same keys as I was provided, the lock has to be replaced and charged to me.

I feel like I should be charged to replace the key, but not the lock. The argument that since I can't prove the key was broken and disposed of is irrelevant - any renter could theoretically makes 100s of copies of the house keys and hold onto them. Either they have to replace all the locks after any renter leaves, or it's just assumed the renter hasn't done this.

Is there any concrete answer on this - am I required to pay for a new lock and locksmith because I can only provide 1 of the two original front door keys?"|canberra|2022|False|0

"I am hoping someone here can give me some advice. I am nearing the end of the recruitment process for a couple of APS positions, both requiring security clearance, NV1 or NV2.

I am concerned about criminal associates. My sister’s boyfriend has just gotten out of jail on bail. His case is fairly serious and I have suspicions he is connected to organized crime, mostly because my sister has sort of been on the periphery of that for years and I am sure she is a “known associate”. She has also worked in the sex industry, not as a sex worker, but as a manager for many years. She’s had substance abuse problems and had a couple of DUI’s, but nothing else. She’s been to rehab and has been clean for a while and has just gotten out of the industry she’s been in.

She and I are very, very different. I went to law school, honours and academic excellence scholarships, and have always been on the straight and narrow. I tried weed and ecstasy as a teen, but nothing since. I barely even drink. I don’t associate with “criminals”, except through working in criminal law.

My sister and I aren’t especially close. We don’t share intimate details of our lives with each other. I lived very far from her for the last 8 years and consequently only saw her a couple of times. Now I live closer and see her about once a month. 

She wants me to meet her boyfriend. I am not sure whether to meet him while I am going through this process.

"Hi friends,

I'm considering attending NJIT/Rutgers/S.I.T (among others spread throughout NY-NJ metro area) for the rest of my undergrad and any feedback would be extremely appreciated!

Desired degree is bio/bio-tech/bio-informatics/biomed engineering (anything works, since I need pre-reqs for med school and love these fields anyway). So far I have completed mainly gen ed courses. I am a great cook/baker (so meal plans are w/e for me), value my independence, tire easily (not psyched for commutes but I can deal) and want to finish up my degree as quickly + with as little debt as possible. (Yes, I know I have to appreciate the experience etc etc--these goals are not mutually exclusive)

I would really appreciate any feedback from any student/alumni of the unis mentioned above--or any other unis tbh--as I am trying to make the most informed decision I can possibly make!

Questions:

* How are the science/math courses (bio, chem, orgo, physics)? Too difficult, just right, professors, workload? Anything is of use to me.

* Did you participate in any clubs/organizations, and if so, how was that? Is there a social union?

* if you commuted--how was it?! Exhausting? Draining? Soul-sucking? Surprisingly not bad?

* Do/did you live on-campus, or off-campus and how is it?! Rent rates, roommates, food, utilities, weekend scene, jobs?

* How much did you manage to fund thru financial aid/merit scholarships/private scholarships & grants? (lots of debt or no worries?)

* If you studied abroad for a semester, did your uni give you a hard time or was it gr8 for you?

* Are you satisfied with your experience & education? Did you get where you wanted to afterwards?

Please friends--any feedback you can give (esp from those of you who are math/science-based degree-seekers) would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance!!"|NewJersey|2016|False|0

"My partner and i recently got engaged, and while its a really exciting time in our lives we have realized that weddings can be pretty pricey (who would have guessed) and there a lot of options out there.

The minute you search ""wedding"" in google you're in for a world of pain.

We aren't really keen on the traditional wedding structure and wanted a really laid back, cocktail styled day.

We have done a bit of searching ourselves but if anyone has any locations that may fit what we are after, id greatly appreciate the help!

We are after a rustic / shabby chic wedding. (not a literal barn, but exposed brick, fairy lights that kind of stuff).

We are specifically trying to find a cafe/restaurant  that has a big tree where we can have the ceremony, take some photos and have a lovely cocktail evening with our guests (under 70)

We have searched around the Mornington Peninsula area specifically, as its so beautiful but anywhere that fits the bill is worth a look!

"Have you heard this robocall (soundboard) ""Hello this is Ray. Thanks for calling back. How are you today? Ar..are you there? I called on behalf of the Texas Coalition of Police & Sheriffs just kicked off their fund raiser that helps to provide financial assistance...""

From what I can find, the calls are coming from Outreach Calling (super legit website) owned by Damian Muziani ([here](https://twitter.com/DamianEmCee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [here](http://damianmuziani.com/Home_Page.php), [here](http://damianmuziani.brandyourself.com/), [here](https://www.facebook.com/muziani), and [here](http://973espn.com/author/damianmuziani/), etc.). The address on their website is listed as the company Regus which offers shared office space (a front for businesses). Glassdoor reviews says how shitty this company is. Tampa Bay Times did a whole write up [here](http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities2.page) on 'America's Worst Charities'. Smarter Giving has terrible reviews ([here](http://smarter-giving.info/category/outreach-calling/)). KSAT did a write up ([here](http://www.ksat.com/news/defenders/dont-be-fooled-know-before-you-give)) that's identical. Essentially, his company thrives on donations for charities in which they only give back like 1% of what they make and pocket the rest. Essentially he pays $8/hr and treats employees like shit.

Apparently he is in New Jersey, a struggling actor, and a *update* anchor for 97.3 ESPN WENJ. 

My question, is how can a radio station hire this guy. They have to know. How has the station, his Facebook, his Linkdin, his Twitter, his website, etc. not been BLASTED with people calling in/posting ""Hello this is Ray""?

"Hello, hoping for some advice related to traveling through your state, as we'll be visiting this summer. Planning to fly to Glacier National Park in Montana to explore, then travel to Devil's Lake and Grand Forks, ND to visit family. 

We are really interested in taking Amtrak if we can - the Empire Builder line runs through this corridor and is competitive with driving! Plus we really like trains. However, we see some logistical issues related to train arrival times, and getting from train station to hotel or rental car. We'd probably be getting off the train in either Minot, Devil's Lake, or Grand Forks. 

So my main questions: If we needed a ride (traditional cab, or rideshares Uber or Lyft) from a train station to a hotel, is it likely we'd be able to get a ride in the 10pm-1am time frame? How is cell service - can we count on it? Basically wondering if we should be worried about being stranded somewhere, or if it's no big deal and we're worrying for nothing. 

Thanks for any advice or tips!"|NorthDakota|2021|False|0

"We were just offered a spot for our soon to be 1 year old. We don’t know anybody at GLPCC but the tour went well. It’s established, the teachers were on the younger side but seemed to handle the conflicts we saw during our tour well. It’s walking distance for us which is my main motivation, our current daycare is in shoreline and the drive is tough with work schedules. We spent about 80-90 minutes a day driving our kid there and back. Our current daycare is a mixed age home daycare so there’s a bit of a sense of community that my partner feels may be lacking at other daycares, even though the class size will be the same, our kid will be one of 12 1-2 year olds instead of the youngest in a 0-5 daycare where she probably gets more attention being the baby. 

Who can provide any testimony in favor or against of the experience at GLPCC? "|seattle|2024|False|0

"Advice on moving to Seattle: recommendations

My partner (32) and I (44) will move at the start of July, coming from Tokyo. The short of our lifestyle, gay but not deep in the scene, interracial (Asian or Japanese supermarket would be awesome), dog that walks 4 miles a day, drive, eat out a fair bit but maybe will cook more. I work remotely but travel a bit, he has full working visa and would like to find a job but not sure on timing.

We will stay near pike place market for the first month and look for long term apartment. I’m earning a bit over 270k, maybe in future he will pitch some in but not relying on it. We are used to living around 800sqf in Tokyo but in smaller rooms. He loves high rises, I like them for the facilities but prefer living lower to the ground.

So the basic question, where would you live and why?

The other fantastic wildcard is zero credit history. Will need to rely on company guarantee, or some third party guarantee. Japan has no convertible credit rating system to US."|seattle|2024|False|0

"I'm making this post to highlight a frequent problem I see in /r/Seattle that I honestly believe is making open discussion much harder than it needs to be, and to solicit opinions on what we can do to fix it. 

I see this pattern play out continuously: 

1. Some user makes a post complaining about a politically contentious topic (eg: homelessness, drug use, etc). 
2. A small group of Reddit super-users (eg: 300k+ comment karma) will immediately descend into the comments section to attack and shame the poster and any agreeing commentors for not being sufficiently liberal or progressive.
3. The comments section devolves into arguments and personal attacks. 
    1. If the super-users are upvoted, they leave their comments up. 
    2. If the super-users are downvoted, they delete all of their comments and block anyone who responded to them.

A good example of this is [this recent post about public transit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1d45gef/as_a_transit_lover_im_worried/) - these folks immediately jumped in to shit on OP for their opinion being reactionary / regressive / republican (literally), became incredibly condescending and rude when they got downvoted, then cut their losses and deleted all comments. 

The beautiful thing about the /r/Seattle comments section is the ability to hear opinions from a wide and diverse array of viewpoints. I know what my friends think, I know what my coworkers think, I want to hear what people *outside of my circle* think. However, I feel that this is absolutely ruined by this group of people who seem more motivated by dunking on others to score karma than actually engaging with the debate in any remotely productive way. Just look at how defensive OP had to be in their public transit post - they couldn't just express their personal and subjective feeling of being uncomfortable, they had to be on guard. It's almost like they knew the attacks were coming.

I know this is the internet, but it's gotten to the point where I actually know these folks by username - if I see them in the comments, 9 times out of 10 it's just the same thing again and again. Why do we tolerate this toxic behavior? Is there anything we can do about it?"|seattle|2024|False|0

"Just wanted to thank whoever is responsible for this. My commute takes me along the bike lane that runs through the waterfront and down the bike lanes on E Marginal Way S to SODO. 

When I heard about the new fancy bike lane being built down there, it was a bit bittersweet. Yes, obviously I love new bike infrastructure, but it wasnt going to be completed until 2025 at least and I would have to find a different, potentially much less flat and protected, bike route to work.

However, to my surprise, SDOT appears to be doing everything possible to keep bike traffic running smoothly during construction. Not only have they rerouted truck traffic though temporary lanes, but they've even made temporary bike lanes squeezed on the sides. They even have flaggers that watch for bike traffic and wave them through when they dont have enough room for a bike lane and a transit lane.

They could have easily closed off the bike lanes entirely during construction to allow car and truck traffic to still go in both directions along the street, but because of this extra care, us bike commuters can bike to work in safety AND we will get a new, even better bike lane in the process. I guess you really can have your cake and eat it too! Usually this kind of thought only goes into how things will impact car traffic, so it feels really nice to be thought of as a biker.

That's really all I wanted to say. Thank you SDOT! (or whoever made this decision!)"|seattle|2024|False|0
"Every single day I have to drive down Eagle Road.   


I. HATE. IT.  


WHY DOES EVERYONE GO 30MPH DOWN EAGLE ROAD? Seriously people. It is 40mph from State Street to the Boise River, and then it is 55 miles per hour from the river until Fairview. From fairview until Overland it is 50mph and from overland to the end of South Eagle Road it is 40mph. So there is no need to go 30mph.  


No one can ever go the damn speed limit. It TRULY grinds my damn gears. When it was announced that the law passed that requires slow drivers to go to the right lane, I had high hopes that it would alleviate this problem; only it has not. It doesn't seem like they are enforcing it, because we still have people going 30 mph down Eagle Road.

"My fiancé and I heard about the free covid testing at the Pepsi center and he decided to go take one even though neither of us had any symptoms. We were shocked when his results came back positive! I went and took one (the whole process takes about 3 minutes) and I am positive as well! Turns out we are both asymptomatic carriers.

Representatives from the center called us and let us know to call back if symptoms develop. They said they want everyone to go get tested. When you sign up online, it gives you a list of symptoms. You need to check at least one to get a test. Do it. They want people to come in. If they are able to show the rates are low, we can move forward with reopening the city, and if they’re high, they can roll out more resources. I’ve heard some people expressing that you shouldn’t go unless you need to because of concern that we will run out of tests. According to the people I spoke with, this is not a concern at all.

Edit: I’ve been told that as of 6/1/2020, you now can be tested without having any symptoms! Answer honestly and go get tested!"|Denver|2020|False|0

"Native of Virginia Beach here. I’ve lived in a couple of different places (NYC, LA, now living in NoVA) and often find myself arguing that Hampton Roads is much more aligned with the Northeast region of the U.S. (NYC, Boston, Wilmington, Baltimore, D.C., etc.) than with the Southeast. I feel that culturally and economically (given that it’s sometimes seen as the southern tip of the Northeast Megalopolis) it’s much more Northern than Southern.

Also share your opinion on other parts of Virginia (or even Virginia as a whole) that you think should be classified as the North instead of the South, if any!

Edit: Meant to say northeast, not northwest

Edit 2: I’ve since sort of landed on more of Mid-Atlantic. I like this distinction, as I find it much more accurate than Northeast and Southeast. It’s just that a lot of people don’t classify the Mid-Atlantic as a real region."|Virginia|2022|False|0

"So I’m a long ways out from making it happen, but I’m considering moving to Hawaii. Within the next two years I will have plenty of savings to get settled into something nice.

I want to do a long term stay before I decide anything, but I want to know what areas I should look at to narrow down where I should visit.

I’m a nurse. I’m also an avid outdoorsman (lots of hiking, bow hunting, fishing under my belt). I have a lot of experience with gardening and livestock. I live near Houston, Texas currently.

I’m hoping to live in an area that is: 

Within 1 hour of beaches I can swim in (preferably closer)
Within 1 hour from a “good” fishing location
A good place for growing fruit trees.

I’m also wanting more of an “off grid” home life.

I know Puna seems to be popular with mainlanders, but the lack of swimming (I hear the beaches have rough water and that most of the water there is very... gross) and high crime rate scares me. My current home is fairly secluded so I’ve never had to worry about that.

"We’re about to renew our utility plan and noticed that average kWh rates are significantly higher than our last contract that was signed 24 months ago.

The avg rate on that plan was 7.8 cents/kWh for 24 month plan. The best rate I can find now is 9.8cents/kWh for a similar plan. That’s a 25% increase.

Are utility rates unusually high right now, or was my last contract unusually low?

"Recently, Marshall County Animal Control has enacted a 60 day to euthanasia policy. The community has done a fantastic job getting these dogs out. Over 100 animals have either been adopted, fostered, or pulled by rescue organizations in the last two weeks. But, there are three left that are scheduled to die on either Monday or 5/15. 

Al is a German Shepherd who did great with livestock and other dogs but was intolerant of a rowdy puppy with no manners yet. For that, he's scheduled to die as early as Monday. 

Mae is a tuxedo pitty type with dog aggression issues. Reported to be great with people.

Champ is a yellow lab mix who's goofy and needs some training, but would make somebody a wonderful pet.

We're heading from Launceston to Hobart on Wednesday. Just wanted to ask what's a fun place should check out? 

I wanted to go to any comic book stores down here but couldn't seem to find any online. Theres one I think in Moonah I want to check out on the way to Hobart. Anyone know of any stores still open?

We also need to get a phone mount for our rental car, we can't seem to find one and dont know anywhere that might sell them other than maybe like harvey norman but ugh.

"Hi friends,

I'm considering attending NJIT/Rutgers/S.I.T (among others spread throughout NY-NJ metro area) for the rest of my undergrad and any feedback would be extremely appreciated!

Desired degree is bio/bio-tech/bio-informatics/biomed engineering (anything works, since I need pre-reqs for med school and love these fields anyway). So far I have completed mainly gen ed courses. I am a great cook/baker (so meal plans are w/e for me), value my independence, tire easily (not psyched for commutes but I can deal) and want to finish up my degree as quickly + with as little debt as possible. (Yes, I know I have to appreciate the experience etc etc--these goals are not mutually exclusive)

I would really appreciate any feedback from any student/alumni of the unis mentioned above--or any other unis tbh--as I am trying to make the most informed decision I can possibly make!

Questions:

* How are the science/math courses (bio, chem, orgo, physics)? Too difficult, just right, professors, workload? Anything is of use to me.

* Did you participate in any clubs/organizations, and if so, how was that? Is there a social union?

* if you commuted--how was it?! Exhausting? Draining? Soul-sucking? Surprisingly not bad?

* Do/did you live on-campus, or off-campus and how is it?! Rent rates, roommates, food, utilities, weekend scene, jobs?

* How much did you manage to fund thru financial aid/merit scholarships/private scholarships & grants? (lots of debt or no worries?)

* If you studied abroad for a semester, did your uni give you a hard time or was it gr8 for you?

* Are you satisfied with your experience & education? Did you get where you wanted to afterwards?

Please friends--any feedback you can give (esp from those of you who are math/science-based degree-seekers) would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance!!"|NewJersey|2016|False|0

"July 27th, Saturday: my fiance, my 7yo stepdaughter and myself were out of town for a birthday trip. LMPD reported to my house for an aggressive dog call. 


My stepdaughter's grandmother (Juanelle) was staying at our house and dogsitting while we were away. At some point in the morning, our 3yo hound dog got out of our yard and into a neighbor's. Juanelle realized this and retrieved the dog from the yard and returned him to our home, not knowing that the neighbor had called the police. 


Later- she took both pups, the hound dog and a pit bull, outside to the bathroom. Not knowing that at that moment an LMPD officer was following up on the call and knocking at the front door.


Walter, our Coonhound mix, saw someone in front of his house and went to greet the officer, who then drew his weapon, firing multiple rounds- hitting and killing him. Mercy, our female Pitbull, was also shot in the leg and ran inside.

I received a frantic call from Juanelle telling me what had happened, and also spoke to a Sergeant Matthew McDaniel.

They left the body of our dog to rot in the sun in our front yard after promising that animal control would take care of ""disposal"" and didn't so much as do a wellness check on our other dog that was shot and cowering in our house. 


These were beloved members of our family and had done nothing wrong outside of being in a neighbor's yard for a matter of minutes. One of them is dead and the other has a shattered leg from a gunshot wound and will likely have to have it amputated. 


I believe that LMPD acted completely irresponsibly and dangerously and not only jeopardized the safety and lives of our pets, but did so in such a callous manner that we are shocked.



Any light you can shed on our story is greatly appreciated."|Louisville|2019|False|0

A business called [14th Street Storage](https://louisvillestorageunits.com) with a listed address of 1400 S 14th. Searching this business on Google Maps shows it between 13th and 15th, where 14th Street would be, however an actual 14th doesn't exist in map view, and street view opens to 15th. 

The other result is a Wikipedia entry for the [14th Street Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Street_Bridge_(Ohio_River)) which also exists between 13th and 15th, but again, is not on an actual 14th Street according to Maps.

* Notices have been placed on the car by myself and the strata management, and haven't been touched since.
* I've called towing companies - some are willing to take it on, noting that the car is down on a lower basement floor - but will charge me a significant cost, and will only leave it in a visitor space (my complex has no visitor spaces).
* I've checked with the police, the car is not stolen. The police apparently won't get involved as the car is on private property.
* Building management has checked camera footage and noted that it was parked on Friday night, but they could not identify the person as they were wearing a mask and hat.
* Building management is trying to get in contact with the owners of the adjacent car spaces.
* My property manager can only keep calling the strata company.

At the moment I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Given now it's day 6 since the car has been in my spot.

"So i am moving into a new house tomorrow and yesterday i got an email from Meloneys that the maintenance team needs to come inspect the balcony to give a quote to fix the balcony.

I cant help but feel frustrated about this since my current landlord did the same when she knew we were about to leave she came into the house with a team and strata manager in our absence stating that this was an emergency as there was a leak in the water pipes somewhere (it was actually to get quotes to get her house renovated)

Now we found ourselves a new place leaving behind this awful experience with our previous landlord, and just after we have paid them the rent and the bond and signed the lease they tell us oh also the balcony needs to be fixed so please accommodate the maintenance team.
To do this i have to either miss my job and stay at home or let complete strangers in my house in my absence.

Please tell me they can’t just use that clause again where they don’t need the tenants permission to enter the house if it is and urgent repairs like a safety hazard of a broken balcony.

"Hello, all! My husband and I are at the point where we can start seriously looking at homes. We have a 20% down payment for our price range, as well as a modest but not insignificant cash bonus ready to go.

We're focusing on areas that don't appeal to the Ski/Remote crowd. Also, far enough away from Burlington that national rental agencies swooping in to install cheap granite countertops, bottom rung stainless steel appliances, and flip it as an $1800/month ""luxury condo"" is less of a concern.  Between current listings and recent sales records of properties similar to what we're looking for, we know it's not impossible to find something relatively soon we can afford.

Anyone know of realtors who have had success for local people making initial offers at/around asking price for starter homes? We know that this may be a long, arduous process and are hoping to find someone who sticks it out with local couples, and understands that we can't afford to play games or get into bidding wars."|Vermont|2021|False|0

"Memorial Day weekend my girlfriend and I are visiting my sister in North Carolina.  Tuesday am we are headed out and want to be at my friend’s house in folly beach by Wednesday night.  I’m an outdoorsman but haven’t explored much down south.  I was intrigued by both Congaree NP and woods bay state park.    My original thought was to either leave super early Tuesday, drive 3 hours, and do a canoe trip at Congaree Tuesday and then camp overnight,  or hit up something like woods bay Tuesday on the way to Congaree, camp and kayak Wednesday.

I was assuming it would make more sense to rent kayaks than haul them down there in my truck, but I’m open to both, as we also plan on doing some kayaking once we are in folly.  I would just want a reasonably clear idea on where to kayak as I’ve heard kayaking down south can be a bit more maze like than up north.  I’d need a shuttle at the very least.

feel free to tell me that any of this is a bad idea, or to steer me in a different direction. maybe skip woods bay and zip straight to Congaree and maximize our time there.  or perhaps skip both and do something entirely different.  Or do a short stop at Congaree and save kayaking for after we arrive at folly beach?

Davidson opposes mail-in voting and only abides by it because it’s law. His arguments against it are extremely niche and what-ifffy. For example, he literally argues:

>It gives a greater opportunity for ballot harvesting and ballot stuffing. Now there's no proof that this is happening, but neither is there proof that it isn't happening.

That he would even consider this method of logic and publicly declare it tells me he‘s a believer of Trump’s lies—and even if he isn’t, he clearly participates in the same rhetorically fallacious nonsense. 

His arguments against ranked-choice voting are cherry picked examples of RCV results he seems to think didn’t work (because they worked just fine but republicans didn’t win).

He wants to shorten the window people have to vote, citing potential ‘voter’s regret’ by people who vote early but want to change their mind.

He conceded that the one redeeming quality is that people have time to vet the candidates carefully in front of their ballots instead of in lines—which is the most important feature of it, and against which any of the other BS arguments pale.

Oaks has [Vowed to refuse marriage licenses](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/07/29/candidate-utah-county-clerk-says/) to same sex couples in Utah County, and that should be all you need to know about him.

Does anyone else believe wythe county is the worst county in VA? They baby an old building for an old presidents wife (Bolling Wilson Hotel) and act like we are some classy town. Its one of the biggest Hotspots for opioids (no fault of the people) and absolutely terrible healthcare and low paying jobs (unless you want to drive an hour each way to and from work). They are closing down a dialysis center in Wytheville while agreeing to use our tax money to install a hockey arena at the apex center that was a flop (it doesn't have paved parking or any indication how to get to it. You literally drive in between 2 ultra busy gas stations to get to it without really knowing if you're going the right way). Maybe I'm just a Debbie downer. Maybe I'm just an A-hole.

Hello Vermonters! Flatlander here. My husband (a Bennington native) and I are considering purchasing a great house up a steep(ish) hill. My 4x4 got up it just fine in sleet/icy conditions no problem, but the road is very narrow and steep with a drop-off on one side. My concern is going in to this without any idea of what our road maintenance responsibilities are. There is no formal agreement in place - only a “handshake agreement “ for plowing in the winter. I noticed the road was covered with a heavy gravel type substance one time, so sanding must be part of that agreement with the plow driver. What happens when there are heavy rains and ruts form? Do I just worry about our portion of the road? Of course the 3 other houses are higher up than us - so I am worried that we will bear the majority of the responsibility to maintain the road at its steepest parts. (which is in front of the house we are considering). We are up for an adventure but don’t want to go in to this in complete ignorance. Your advice is appreciated!! Thank you 🙏 |Vermont|2018|False|0

"We've seen daily updates of Covid stats on here while we were setting records.  However, now that the news is good (we do like good news, right?), the updates from the negative people has stopped. So, I've decided it would be nice to add a good news post.  This is the status of three important metrics: Total cases, Deaths and Hospitalizations.

**Cases**: Overall cases are still trending up slightly.  However, peak case number was on June 12 and testing positives has been holding steady in the 8-10% range.

**Deaths**: The death numbers and death rate continue to drop.  This is a stat that is obvious at the national level as well as in NC.  

**Hospitalizations**: At 843 today, it is the lowest number since 829 on June 16 and has been trending down since the peak of 915 on June 23.  Total and ICU beds are looking stable and plenty available.

I'll be the first to admit that I don't know which way it will go from here.  There are many things that could have contributed to the positive trend in the statistics.  But, it is good to at least see that, at least so far, the reopen and protests have not put us in the dire shape that some have been predicting.

"Hey, not sure if this is the right place to post - but I've been looking around for a short term rental (june to august-ish). Very common dates, I know. 

I've been up to Maine a few times and it's always been a draw to me. I'm most familiar with Rockport, Portland, Acadia area, Bangor, Belfast, and a few other spots. I have a few friends from *the deep south of the far north* too, so I've heard a bit about the ins and outs.

Anyways, I'm looking for a short term rental near the water and was wondering if there are any sites that go by monthly (vrbo, etc all go daily). Or if anyone has any tips on areas. I'd like to be somewhere quiet, but not totally recluse - like near a town with a bar or two and a grocery store. Also being somewhat near an ice rink would be pretty cool. 

So I guess my main questions are if there are any sites besides craigslist or vrbo for short term rentals and what areas I should check out.

Thanks, and sorry if these types of posts are frowned upon here.

Trail Dames is a hiking club for women of a curvy nature. However, all women are welcome! The Dames are a group of women who are looking for a chance to get out and see the beauty that this world has to offer. We hike relatively slowly, enjoying every second, because we know that it is not the destination that is important, but the journey. If you are concerned that you are too old, too out of shape, too curvy to keep up, you need not worry. We stop frequently, laugh a lot and are committed to creating an experience of celebrating nature and each other. All Trail Dames hikes are chosen with beginners in mind, and are do-able by everyone!

"Hello Reddit

We have a serial pooper and an amazon package thief in our apartment complex. 
For the last year and a half, we have throughout our apartment complex had someone who enjoys defecating in the walkways.
Our apartment complex has not done anything to resolve this.
  
Last week an amazon package was stolen from the front door of my apartment.  My neighbor has a ring camera and we reviewed the footage we noticed this one middle aged caucasian male that always walks around our complex at odd hours.  He was the only person near our door on the ring camera after amazon notified us that a package was delivered.  I was even angrier to find out it was a resident.

Coincidentally, the next day I stepped outside to go get a coffee and lo and behold, this same person was walking by my front door.  They were extra talkative to me.  I immediately confronted them about the stolen package.  They seemed very nervous and couldn’t get their story straight.  I demanded that they return our package.  When I got back from getting coffee, the package was there.

The next day, someone defecated in our walkway.  The serial pooper struck again.  
I am convinced this package thief is also the serial pooper and this was a retaliation for being caught.
Thus far, our apartment complex, Tamarron apartments, has done nothing to resolve this.  They did not answer my emails.  When I went into the office to discuss this with them they tried to give canned responses.  They still have not even had the feces cleaned up.  Outrageous.

It’s really frustrating.  I have purchased a blink camera that now keeps an eye out from our window.

Since I’ve adopted her she has been attacked five times by other dogs; three at the dog park - other dog owners were on their phones, myself and other people had to break up the fights- and twice on our walk in our neighborhood. We do not go to the dog park anymore, and we avoid parts of our neighborhood. I used a dog trainer when I first adopted her and things were going well, no aggression towards other dogs. Fast forward to now and she is aggressive towards dogs over resources like food, toys, and her space. Does anyone know of a reputable dog trainer here in the valley? Thanks!|phoenix|2023|False|0

"Curious about /r/Australia's comments about former Prime Ministers getting their payments after serving for a certain amount of time, I wondered if there was an equivalent for the NT, and what the terms were.

[This is the document I looked up](http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/members-of-parliament/Guide_to_Members_Entitlements.pdf): ""Guide to Members Entitlements.""

Page 6 of 19 states:

> **2.2 Resettlement Allowance** 


> An allowance is provided to a retiring or defeated Member who meets the following criteria [Clause 15, RTD, section 4AA AMSORE and Chief Minister’s Determination tabled 26 May 2016]. If:

>• the Member was elected at or after the general election of 2005;

>• the Member will not receive a pension or superannuation benefit related to service in the Assembly immediately after ceasing to be a Member;

>• the Member has not been disqualified from continuing as a member due to a
conviction for an offence resulting in imprisonment for 12 months or longer as per
section 21 of the *Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978*

>• the Member has not been elected to another Australian parliament.

> The Resettlement Allowance is equal to one month of basic salary for each year served as a Member of the Assembly with a minimum of four months and a maximum equivalent to 12 months. It is payable at the rate of basic salary applicable on the date the Member is taken to have retired.

So if a person serves for over 4 years, they get 4 months worth of a basic salary, one month for one year. If they were elected after 2005.

Above this part, in 2.1:

> **2.1 Level of Basic Salary**

> From 1 January 2016, the basic salary of a Member is $153,312 subject to normal taxation rates paid fortnightly in arrears.

I'm not very good at math, but before tax, $153,312 over 12 months is $12,776 a month. The *minimum* is four months, so at a minimum, the NT Tax Payer is giving these guys $51,104.

If they served longer, they get more, to a maximum of 12 years. If they act as Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Opposition Whip, they're still serving and will get $153,312 a year, plus more. You can see the additional salary on Page 7, and then Electorate Allowances on Page 8.

With all this money flying around, I hope the newly elected Parliament does a good job, and doesn't waste public money for another 4 years."|darwin|2016|False|0

"I'm looking at moving pretty soon and would really appreciate any recommendations for apartment buildings in or around the city. 

I work in the CBD so pretty flexible as to which direction I live. First choice would be South Brisbane but there's not many options in my price range, so having to expand the search to more suburbs. 

I prefer a modern high rise building, and my main requirement is an oven (I don't have one now, and it kills me). 

Got a few viewings booked for next week, including the Peppers building in the Valley, which on paper sounds ideal but the reviews concern me.

If anyone can point me in any other directions, I'd really appreciate it! 

Also, if anyone has tips on the questions to ask at a viewing, let me know. This is my first time not looking for a place on flatmates so I'm a newbie.

"Okay guys, I'm in the market to build my 1st home. But I'm in a bit of a pickle. I have a price range of max around 450k that's all I'm comfortable looking at going into debt with. So that limits my options. So does my preference for Northside, I've no interest south of the river. And I'm building, the grants just make things a lot more feasible for me as a single guy. 

So I'm in a predicament. I can either spend 400-450k in the likes of Caboolture/Morayfield/Upper Caboolture for 600m2 house and land. Or I can spend 400-450k in Narangba/North Harbour/Dakabin/Kallangur/Griffin et Al house and land on max 400m2.

I'm hesitant to bite the bullet with Caboolture as I grew up in the area and really didn't want to go back to there but the price and land size is enticing. 

I like Narangba area have friends that live in the area and it's quite nice in the their little areas.

I did consider apartments but I wouldn't really qualify for the grants, and for me to afford to buy I would need the grants, and with the way the grants are worded I wouldn't qualify. And I'm not sure many places do low deposit loans for apartments anyway. 

I am considering putting it off and saving more, but cost of rent and living us just making it an extremely slow slog and the rise in house prices outstrips my ability to save.

"Im going to ask legal aid tomorrow but ill ask here as well, the father of 2 of my younger siblings is threatening to call police to come to the house and forcibly remove possessions of those siblings that are in this house. Up until my mother died on the 8th of this month, they lived 95% of the time here, and i am already in contact setting up legal aid to dispute him going for full custody (there are many various reasons such as criminal history and previous restraining orders etc. against him for this). My mother and he were NOT in any form of relationship for 7+ years before her death, so there is no de facto relationship stuff for him to claim.

The father of those 2 only had visitation every 2nd weekend, since her death he has kept them away from this house. (he came over the days he died and took them, did it while we were all in shock from her death still, claiming it was overnight.) Honestly if i wasnt so overwhelmed by everything (im only 22) i would have stopped him taking them, but i wasnt mentally aware of what was going on from it all.



So basically, he is demanding all of their clothes that we keep here for them (they were all bought by mum, and as her next of kin, basically belong to me now) He is harassing me and my father through calling and texts claiming he is coming over to get them and bringing the police as we are 'illegally withholding their possessions'. As stated though we are going through legal aid to get custody ourselves, and believe that it all should remain in the household for when they are back here, or even if they just visit. 

As this time he is claiming to hold court orders confirming his current full custody but also refuses to show them to us. As it has only been 3 weeks since her death, i and my social worker find this unlikely unless he lied to court about our wish to have part/full parental rights."|brisbane|2017|False|0

"Hi everyone, 

My partner just got offered a job at John Hopkins Childrens (Baltimore) and we are hoping to move from Missouri to Maryland soon. I was wanting to check in for a few things with the locals. 

-My partner and I will be making 139k gross (this is a bump in our income). Would Maryland be nice to us on that salary? We don’t want to live paycheck to paycheck. Savings is definitely something we want to continue. We know there will be a sticker shock compared to Missouri for sure. We are in STL right now.
-With John Hopkins being Baltimore, is it safe? The shifts are at night so we want to make sure it’s not funky. 
-We are trying to find a suburb which is decently close to John Hopkins and where we can rent a 1bd1bth for under $1600. Is that possible? 
-Safety of course for where we live. 
-We have two cars with us. Upon some research I found out MD title transferring is crazy expensive (north of $1000). We have a 10 year old sedan and a 5 month old SUV. 
-No kids for now. Will probably have 1 in the next 1.5-2 years
-We love food and would love a good food scene. Love nature so hiking trails and parks etc are wonderful. 
-Ideally would want to rent for 2 years and if we like MD, get a house. We are not into the whole big house thing. So a good condo or townhome would be good for us. 

Reasons to leave MO
-It’s very red (STL is purple yes) but we are hoping to be somewhere BLUE. 
-School districts are rough overall
-Proximity to a major airport. MDs access to IAD is great. I at least travel 2 times a year international and have family fly in 1-2 times. STL has an international airport but it’s for name only. The major airport really helps in cutting down travel time and cost. 

The internet so far has been very mixed on our gross total salary and being able to live in MD. I am hoping to get some clarity if this is even a good move. 

Thanks in advance!!

"Hey reddit,

My husband and I were talking about a stray dog we found in late 2018 (sometime after August, I don't remember exactly when), and realized that someone here might know him.

We were about a block from the Siff Uptown at about 10pm one night when we found a dog by himself without a collar or license. The dog was one of the friendliest, chillest dogs I'd ever met. If I didn't have cats, I would become a dog person and adopted him on the spot.

The vet and pet shop were closed, so we couldn't check for a microchip or get a leash. Another couple saw us and they had a rope, but they didn't have a car to take him to the all night vet. We did, so our powers combined, we were a full grown adult capable of dealing with the situation (if you were the other couple, and wondered how it turned out, it turned out great thanks to you. Thank you!)

As they were going to get the rope, the dog wandered across the street to the gas station on Queen Anne and Denny. That felt weird, because he'd been happy to hang out with  us and get pets before then (thankfully, it was late enough that there weren't any cars). He parked himself in front of the door and cried a little.

I tried to apologize to the guy at the gas station, that it wasn't my dog, but he was nice. The guy said he knew the dog. He was  a homeless guy's dog\*. According to the gas station clerk, the homeless guy stole some beer from the gas station and since it's easier to find ""guy with dog"" than ""guy,"" he ditched the dog. The dog kept sitting in front of the door, waiting.

The couple came back with a rope to use as a leash and I grabbed the car. We drove him to the 24-hour vet and he was scared (it seemed like his first time in a car), but he didn't snap or bark. The vet helped us figure out what to do with him overnight until the shelter opened in the morning.

We didn't think to take a picture, but one of the vet techs sent us this one. We called him Dave Grohl on the surrender form (because Nirvana was on the radio on the ride over and he was So. Chill.), but a coworker who was a shelter volunteer heard he got adopted out almost immediately with the name Seamus. We texted the vet tech who ALSO tried to adopt the dog, but didn't get her landlord to agree to letting her keep a dog fast enough. By the time she got there, he already had a home. Literally everyone who met this dog at every step of this story wanted to adopt him, he was that great of a dog.

Like I said, last I heard, he was adopted out as Seamus. If you know him, I'd love to hear how he's doing.

TLDR: We brought a stray puppy to the shelter in late 2018 and I was wondering how he's doing.

\*Please don't villify the guy. Addiction and homelessness are rough and he'd obviously done a great job of socializing him. Part of me still feels bad that I couldn't reconnect them, but that night, we were trying to do what was best for the dog, and right then, that was a steady stream of food and shelter.

"Some more info:

Just got my first utilities bill. Water/Sewage/Trash/Gas is billed through the leasing company so I have no insight into the actual numbers. Leasing office is closed today, and I fully intend to ask them the same question, but figured I'd try and get some info and maybe some answers online.

I have an electric stove, and my heating is through a heat pump. I have three potential guesses as to why I was charged for gas, but all of it seems like kind of BS, not sure how they will spin this. My guesses are that they charge all apartments for gas because some apartments have a gas fireplace (I don't), it's for gas that _might_ be used for heating common areas, it's for gas that _might_ be used to centrally heat water before it's distributed, but I also have a hot water meter so idk.

The charge also indicates that it's for 12/01-12/31 but I only moved in halfway through the month, so that's also BS.

&nbsp;

Anyone know if there is a way to get the specific meter readings for water/gas that were used to calculate the bill? My PSE account just shows electric. I'll ask all these questions tomorrow to the leasing office, but this post is also my way of ranting a bit, appreciate you good people listening.

"I'm moving to the Wilmington area and am house shopping.  Recently saw a townhouse in Midtown Brandywine.  I'm debating between living in that area or instead going for a peaceful, boring, expensive house in the suburbs.

The appeal of Wilmington (specifically Midtown Brandywine or Trolley Square) is that it is much more affordable to get a high quality house/townhouse.  The suburbs of DE are loaded with god awful cookie cutter housing monstrosities.  Additionally, I have read that Midtown Brandywine is a nice little community, and Trolley square is accessible from there and is hip/etc...

But for the most part, you read that Wilmington DE is a total goddamn disaster.  Sure, there are a few nice neighborhoods, but for the most part the city is overburdened with crime, often violent.  Therefore, if you choose to live in Wilmington, you go for one of the nice areas and avoid the others like the plague (and hope that occasional spillover violence doesn't get you).  There are new articles about the new mayor trying to revitalize the city, but it's not clear that there is any trend in the right direction.

I'm all for giving a city a chance, but I don't want to be afraid to leave my townhouse, or accidentally turn the wrong corner and get stabbed.  It doesn't bother me so much that Wilmington has a reputation for being boring; the crime does bother me though.

"Hi Reddit,

I'm a travel journo that visited Hawaii late last year and am wanting to feature this amazing food truck paradise that I found in Waikiki.

I can't for the life of me remember what it's called, except that it's got an Ohana Burger there and an outdoor seating area with red umbrellas. I've got a picture that I snapped.

Can anybody tell me what this food truck lot is called (if it has a name) and where it's located? Of if there are is any information you can offer about this place?

"Hey there,

I’m the person who asked what is was like for trans ppl in South Dakota. Definitely staying away from rural areas, but I think Rapid City should be ok for people like me. I don’t really have a choice in moving haha, so I’ll have to go to SD either way.

Anyways, for people who go to WDT, what’s it like? What programs/majors are you in? How do you like them? Are there other trade schools near Rapid City that you’d suggest?

Any advice would be appreciated :) I’m thinking of going into a construction major/program. I’ve always loved doing stuff hands on and especially building stuff.

"I am ashamed this absolute piece of shit represents Maine. He’s been nothing but disappointing, and his past comments on the “radical left” and student loan forgiveness were just further proof he isn’t interested in policy to benefit Mainers or even is aligned with his party— he totes the line to stay in power and masquerades as a democrat. 

He’s against student loan forgiveness but had no qualms with his wife taking out huge PPP loans that were forgiven. 

He was against tighter gun laws and regulations until the shooting in Lewiston.  

He has declared he thinks Trump will win and that he’s fine with it.

He is one of 12 democrats who haven’t endorsed Kamala for president despite her being the clear front runner, was quoted saying he will not commit to voting for her in November bc he’s a “free thinker,” and explicitly criticized her while over the border crisis. Biden/Harris can’t snap their fingers and change the asylum seeker or immigration laws, that’s the job of Congress— why isn’t he acting more assertively in congress, then?

 He said he will not endorse Kamala until she shows him how she will benefit his district— bc project 2025 and the man telling people at rallies there will be no more voting ever again if he’s elected will clearly help the people, especially the seniors who will lose all their benefits, in Maine.

I live in Maine and need new heating system. I am looking at switching over to natural gas and looking at the wall hung units. My question is where I would not be using heat for approximately 4-5 months out of the year should I just get new separate heat pump hot water heater instead of the combination gas unit wall hung combo that does hot water. I am getting very different recommendations from professionals. My goal would be to get as much life out of wall hung unit as possible but also have the most efficient energy.

"Hello,

I hate asking for help but my cousin David really needs it. He and my uncle lived together in Cumberland and when my uncle got sick, David stayed home and took care of him. My uncle received care through Medicaid as he was in his 70's and was not able to work. Unfortunately, my uncle died and has left David with the burden of having to pay back the $110k of his medical bills. The reason is this was David's childhood house and it is his home. In order to keep his home, David has to pay this or the Estate Recovery will take everything. They do not care that David does not have the money or that is his home. They do not care that it will leave him homeless. My family has gathered as much as we can but we need more to help him. Any amount is truly appreciated.

"So, I'm planning a long weekend for early September, like the weekend after Labor Day. Probably 10-15 dudes. Everybody lives pretty close to Wilmington or in Philadelphia. We're all middle-class, 30-year-old white dudes, but no one's really raking in tons of cash at this point. We're on a budget of maybe $400 - $500 total per person for the whole weekend. So - a total estimated budget of between $4000 - $7500 for everything (food/drink/lodging/travel/activities). 

We're pretty adventurous. We all like to drink and smoke a little pot. A few of us have dabbled in psychedelics. I've been to a few strip clubs, but I don't consider myself a ""strip club guy,"" and I don't really have any intentions of cheating on my fiancée. It's a fairly physically active group overall, so I'm not opposed to some light physical activity. Maybe paintball? 

I want to keep the travel time to a minimum, so maybe a 2-3 hour drive in any direction. I'm ruling out flying anywhere.

**Some of the things I am considering are:**

-Renting a beach house in Wildwood or Avalon

-Renting a lake house in the Pocano's 

-Renting a bay-front house on the eastern shore of Maryland 


**Some things I'm ruling out:**

-A weekend in Philly, since a bunch of people already live there, and we've done it before 

-Atlantic City, since I spent five years working in a casino and I'm over it



Any recommendations for locations or activities would be greatly appreciated!

"I am fairly new transplant to MN - and live in Scott County. I have a first time middle schooler - and his school informed us they do not offer any after school care.

When I called the school, the administrative seems surprised I'd need this service, almost insinuating he's old enough to stay by himself (This is my first child at this age - so I really don't know what's normal). He does have a iPhone. He also can walk easily from the bus stop to our house.  I just feel like thats a drastic change for him but looks like we are running out of options.  

What have other parents done? Is this normal in MN? Any suggestions or feedback?

In fact, just days ago, I got downvoted in here for saying let's become a community again and support each other. Politics are politics. These two parties that most of you support are driving us nowhere but into the ground. 

This rant began after watching the ""confirmation hearing"" of RFK Jr. Watching that debacle, of ranting and raving, no questions asked just statements, no interest in his answers. Just mouth flapping. The Democrats trying to hold his hard line on abortion. The Republicans trying to hold the same line on abortion. As if this is the only goddamn thing Iills our society. Or what did you say about a vaccine on a podcast 6 years ago. Well my kids are all vaccinated, we don't care about that. What about this podcast?

All of this absolute nonsense going on, as someone who comes down the center and says we need to focus on why Americans are not healthy. They grow up on bad foods, they develop diseases, and this puts a tremendous strain on all the healthcare that we have in this country. Someone just trying to say that simple thing, is railroaded. By both sides just to push an agenda. And increase outrage. 

Wake up people. These people who you elect to represent us represent nothing, but corporate interests, and their own pocketbooks. Set your differences aside, and start trying to lean into listening to the other side.

What you see represented is what I walk a day, compared to the average 40-year-old American. As you will see, the average 40-year-old American walks less than 5,000 steps a day. We are fat, we are unhealthy, we don't exercise, and we eat horrendous chemicals through our food. Wake up.

* 1 dried (small) New Mexico Pepper (seeded)
* 1 ancho (small) (did not seed)
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1T brewed soy sauce (I like light to cook with, dark is for dipping sauces)
* 1T fish sauce
* 1/2 cup AP flour
* 3/4 stick delicious butter
* 1T chili powder (or more, to taste)
* 1T olive oil
* 1 14.5oz can of ""tomato sauce""
* 1 bottle Miller Lite
* 2 cups water
* Salt to taste
* Black pepper to taste

In Dutch oven smash ground chuck into single layer on bottom of DO. Barely cover with water and cook on low, go watch cartoons and now and then stop by to mix and break up chunks with a whisk.

Repeat with ground pork. Drain both in colander for 5-10 minutes.

Add both to food processor and pulse a couple of times until completely broken up and sort of fine. Put mix back in bowl.

Seed New Mexico pepper and bust up Ancho. Add to small saucepan with chicken broth and simmer at low until peppers are fully hydrated and mushy.

Take remaining vegetables and jam them into food proc. Seed jalapeno and Fresno peppers and remove that white stuff. Leave them in for additional heat. Add chili powder. Add teaspoon of salt/pepper. Pulse until finely chopped.

In same DO, sauté veg mix in olive oil until soft and rawness cooked out of powder. Add soy and fish sauce. Looking for a nice rich brown. Liquids should be completely cooked down and incorporated into veg mix. Deglaze with 1/4 bottle of beer.

Add back to food proc. Add peppers/chicken broth to food proc. Process until pureed. No vegetable textures are wanted, only flavor.

Pre-heat oven to 350. Wipe down DO. Add butter and melt over low heat. Whisk in flour. Cook roux over low heat until flour and butter are fully incorporated. It should be about the consistency of toothpaste with a slight sheen from the butter. Not clumpy. Cook in oven until beige-ish. You don't want a gumbo roux.

Remove from oven and back onto low heat. Add puree. Add meat mix. Add can of sauce. Add remaining beer. Add 1 cup water. Mix until all fully incorporated.

Watch 3 episodes of Rick & Morty. Chili is now ready to serve. At Lindy's, they serve it with finely shredded mild cheddar, finely chopped fresh onion, and a dollop of sour cream. I don't like crackers because I fell like they dilute flavor, so to hell with those. Use the green parts from your green onions if you are cheap, because that's what I did, because I am.

THERE IS NO GODDAMN CUMIN IN THIS RECIPE. DON'T DO IT.

The offer was about $55,000 mexican pesos a month, which translates to approx. $2,500 usd a month. (Payment would be in USD)

Also since tensions rise between both countries, is it a good time to move to USA? It would include a work visa of course.

"Hey all! 

I visited Hobart for a weekend earlier this year, and really enjoyed my time! I'm in dire need of a break over the Xmas/ny period, and was contemplating spending my leave in Tassie! I have a bunch of niggling questions: 
- What's it like over the break period, people-wise? Is it hectic?
- Do the national parks often get closed due to weather? (I'm guessing less likely to have fires in the upcoming season due to La Nina/+ IOD?). 
- I don't particularly care for Christmas, but I'd assume a lot of places would be closed - do they close national parks on Xmas?
- I am partial to fireworks on NYE... I'm guessing Hobart would be best? Or any other NYE location suggestions?
- any other recommendations you've got for travelling at this time of year? Should I come over this period? Or is there a better time? My partner and myself are restricted really to this break as far as leave goes unfortunately...

When I was here I did the Salamanca Markets, MONA and Pt Arthur, I'll definitely do MONA again, loved it! But the other two I'd be happy to forego! I think I'd rather spend my time in Tassie out and about away from Hobart, so any tips or advice I'd be super appreciative!

"I found a cassette tape titled 'Random Notes live - Caribbean Room 23/11/86'.  I remember the band, because I was in it, and I even remember this venue, at least the playing in it part, but I don't remember exactly where it was.  I know it was in Salamanca Place, and it was on the top floor of one of the pubs on one of the corners, because I remember lugging gear up and down the stairs.   Anyone remember anything more than that?

One thing I do remember about The Caribbean Room: we got a residency there on Friday and Saturday nights. This was  cool, because we got to take the door, which meant we actually made money for a change.  But it fucked up big time when we couldn't make a Friday night for some reason.

"...And I need you guys' opinions. 

So I sold my car before I moved here a few months ago, because 1. it was getting old and I figured it made more sense financially to just buy a new one instead of spending $$$ to ship it across the country, and 2. everybody would tell me horror stories about how often they got parking violations, and how they would add up to almost a car payment every month. So I figured I would try things out without a car at first, and get myself established before I considered getting one. I've been taking the bus/train everywhere, and don't really mind, it's only $100/month and I never have to worry about parking. 

But now i'm considering a new transportation method. I was thinking about getting a Vespa instead of a car. My S/O has a car and we live together, but he has work, etc and I have school, so we each have our own schedules during the week, but on the weekends he does all of the driving :) So the Vespa would just be a weekday transportation method for me, to and from school, and maybe weekend beach strolls. 

Any thoughts/opinions/tips?

"I am fairly new transplant to MN - and live in Scott County. I have a first time middle schooler - and his school informed us they do not offer any after school care. I have tried to search for after school care but I am only getting daycares for small children. My child isn't interested in any of the sports offerings and is planning on a few evening activities offered by community ed - but while we are working we aren't sure where he could go between 2-6 pm. 

When I called the school, the administrative seems surprised I'd need this service, almost insinuating he's old enough to stay by himself (This is my first child at this age - so I really don't know what's normal). He does have a iPhone. He also can walk easily from the bus stop to our house.  I just feel like thats a drastic change for him but looks like we are running out of options.  

What have other parents done? Is this normal in MN? Any suggestions or feedback?

"Hi! So, a little background: I currently live in central Indiana with my husband. We have a 2.5 year old daughter and a baby due to arrive in August. My husband was just told last week his company is shutting down and he will be out of a job in 60 days. However, the parent company really likes him and would like to keep him. This means a raise, a sign on bonus, and relocation. Their current opening is in Lumberton, NC. I started doing research and read it’s the most dangerous city in the state. I also have read some really positive reviews that it’s a great small town, friendly people, southern hospitality, etc. 

If the job is offered we will certainly visit - but I am too anxious to wait. What do you know about Lumberton? Will I be okay to put my kids in the public schools? Will it be safe for me to take my kids to the park, out and about during the day while my husband is at work?

I am from Indianapolis. I am not a stranger to high crime and watching my surroundings, but I also know the city like the back of my hand so I know where to avoid or be extra cautious. With moving out of state, I just worry about moving with my two little babies to a “dangerous” city I know nothing about. 

If you don’t recommend Lumberton, are there any surrounding cities you think are family friendly? How is Fayetteville? We are middle class, and my husband is willing to commute up to 45 minutes.

Our backup plan was him to title it in NY and then sell it to me and then I'll title it here, but that just sounds like extra steps. It needs to be titled to me and registered in state for me to add it to my insurance."|Tennessee|2021|False|0

Anytime there's traffic near the airport, the solution seems to drive through Airport Dr and crawl through the airport, where there's more intersections, more traffic lights and larger vehicles.

We were close, started our university degree together (Software Eng. - Monash Clayton) in 2003.

I visited him in the Alfred, and a while later (unsure of time, could be months to a year or so) in a private hospital/care facility in Ivanhoe - both times he was unconscious/in a coma.

I know:

* his name
* background was South African/Indian
* he was from Apendale Gardens (area-ish)
* finished highschool in 2002 (not necessarily in Aspendale Gardens)
* his dad was also in the accident, but IIRC his inuries weren't as bad
* back sometime in 2003-6 I remember searching (online) for him and finding a local church article on him - this is how I may have found out about his stay in the Ivanhoe Hospital

North Dakota
Political control: North Dakota has a legislature dominated by Republicans who want to ban abortion, and the GOP governor had hoped to see Roe v. Wade wiped off the books in favor of state's rights.

Background: The state has passed some of the nation's strictest abortion laws, including one that would have banned abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can happen before a woman knows she is pregnant. The law never took effect because the state's lone abortion clinic successfully challenged it in court. One failed Republican proposal would have charged abortion providers with murder with a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Effect of Supreme Court ruling: North Dakota has a trigger law that will shut down the state's sole abortion clinic in Fargo after 30 days. That 2007 state law makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless necessary to prevent the pregnant woman's death or in cases of rape or incest. Violators could be punished with a five-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.

What's next: The owner and operator of the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo said she would explore all legal options to ensure abortion services are available in North Dakota. Should that fail, clinic leader Tammi Kromenaker plans to move across the river to Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion has not been outlawed. Planned Parenthood says it can provide abortions in Moorhead until Kromenaker gets up and running."|NorthDakota|2022|False|0

"Hey /r/LosAngeles,

I'm looking for someone who would be able to foster two adult cats (11-12years) for two months. They've been staying in an office for the past month and before that in a tall kennel. They belong to my sister and I and we've been going twice every day to clean and feed them but unfortunately this month is the last month they can be there. After my father passed away in late June I've been trying to find a place to live for myself and them. A good majority of rooms in the area don't allow pets. My mother is going to be moving into a house at the end of November where we'll be able to keep them. Everything is already signed for the house so we're trying to hold onto the cats until then. I'm willing to provide all the supplies they need. 
They've been indoor cats all their lives. The black one(female) usually slept with me. The boy does have a behavioral problem that I've noticed in the last few months where he'll use the litter box but pee right outside of it. I've seen the vet about this and there seems to be no infection. It could be because of the new surroundings. For this reason I'm hoping they'll be able to stay in someone's back yard for less of a mess and problem. I have paperwork for all their shots and they're spayed and neutered. They really only have until tomorrow and we've called around on local facebook groups for pet boarding but no luck so far.

"I'll keep it brief,

I work for a Virginia country club that closed down mid-March due to COVID (I work in the childcare section within the rec center). They did not furlough us but offered to continue paying us until we were allowed to come back.

It kind of sucked to see everyone around me making bonkers dough off unemployment but there was nothing I could do.

So anyways, cut to late May when I get the notice we are reopening for Phase 2 the first week of June. They send out a message saying leave pay will cease the 31st of the month—as everyone in the rec center returns to work on the 1st. However, my chill boss informs me our section is not opening until the 9th. I text the higher-ups asking if this means there will be a gap in wages. No response.

So—here's a critical piece of the puzzle: there's a weird mandatory orientation the Friday before we return (keep in mind this is the gap week). It's basically us, a few college kids, standing around with our hands in our pockets waiting around for a higher-up to briefly explain the obvious (the importance of hand sanitizer and washing hands). It seemed normal enough at the time, but in retrospect, I think this was arranged as a formality to possibly gain legal leverage (which I'll explain now)...

Basically I get back and receive a paycheck at the end of my first week. The gap week is not included in my pay. I am told by my boss to just swallow the cost and basically implies I should dawn an attitude that whatever the higher-ups do or say goes. My co-worker doesn't seem to mind or care either (to be honest, their apathetic reactions make me feel like maybe this is only affecting me, but who knows?)

I walk to the main house after my shift and ask if I can get paid for those hours or if I should just claim them on unemployment. She says I can't file them for unemployment because technically I did work that week (Friday, the orientation). I point out the obvious—a few hours and a week's wages are two different things. She says she'll look into it.

So basically she is saying the club won't compensate me but also that I can't claim unemployment because of a suspiciously BS orientation I am now convinced she orchestrated for this reason. Is she right? Or can I claim that week?

I actually forgot to clock-in for the orientation if that makes a difference haha.

I make 14 an hour so this money is legit like my rent/food money for me. Their attitude has been very discarding so I hope there's some positivity at the end of this tunnel.

Thanks for taking your time to read this,

John

TLDR; my employer, who continued to pay us during quarantine, did not include the final week in my paycheck.

"Full Article:

The viral, rash-causing and headline-grabbing disease that was first diagnosed in Fairbanks in 2015 is getting a new name: borealpox.

Known up to now as Alaskapox, the disease is caused by a virus in the orthopox family that includes smallpox and other pox viruses.

There are only seven known cases to date, six in Fairbanks that resulted in relatively mild effects that resolved on their own and one on the Kenai Peninsula that led to the death of an elderly man whose immune system was weakened after treatments for cancer.

News of the name change came from Katherine Newell, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiology field officer working at the Alaska Department of Health, who spoke at a conference hosted by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.

“We are changing the name of Alaskapox virus to borealpox virus, which is what it will now be known as from now on,” Newell said in a presentation Tuesday at the Alaska Tribal Conference on Environmental Management held in Anchorage.

There are two reasons for the name change, which is already shown on the Alaska Department of Health’s website and is expected to be made official in coming weeks by the CDC and the World Health Organization, she said.

One reason is scientific. While the discovery is new and the only cases found to date have been in Alaska, there is mounting evidence that the virus has been circulating in populations of small mammals for decades – and is expected to be in boreal regions beyond Alaska.

“While we’re only had cases to date in Fairbanks and now in Kenai, it’s likely that this virus probably is endemic throughout most of the state, if not the state, and also into Canada and potentially other regions as well,” Newell said.

The fatal Kenai case, which elevated Alaskapox from a scientific curiosity into a more serious issue, provided some key evidence about the wider range. The virus identified there was different genetically from the virus found in the Fairbanks area, indicating wider geographic dispersal over a longer timeframe.

Other evidence comes from the vast collection of northern animals kept at the University of Alaska Museum of the North.

Several of the museum’s northern red-backed vole specimens, including one collected more than 25 years ago from Denali National Park and Preserve, tested positive for the virus, said Link Olson, the museum’s curator of mammals and a former biology professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

“It’s been circulating for a while. How long is a while? No one knows,” said Olson, who was a coauthor of the scientific study that first described Alaskapox and the 2015 human case.

The second reason to change the name to borealpox is more philosophical. The WHO in 2015 took a stance against naming newly discovered human diseases after geographic areas to avoid unfair stigmas.

Geographic disease names can be inaccurate. That was famously the case for the influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 50 million people starting in 1918. Despite being first diagnosed in Kansas, that disease came to be known as the “Spanish flu.”

Some geographic disease names are already too entrenched to change, Newell said. Some examples are Ebola, first discovered near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo; West Nile virus, which first emerged in the West Nile district of Uganda; and Lyme disease, discovered in and around Lyme, Connecticut.

But the discovery and naming of Alaskapox and the virus that causes it is new enough that a name change can be made effectively, Newell said.

The WHO’s 2015 recommendations also advised against using animal names for newly discovered human diseases. Thus the disease originally known as monkeypox, to which Alaskapox is related, has now been officially renamed mpox.

For the Alaskapox/borealpox virus, red-backed voles and other small mammals scurrying around the forest appear to be the reservoir. But it took a few years to pin that down.

In 2015, after the first case was identified, Olson and Aren Gunderson, manager of the museum’s mammal collection, trapped some small mammals on the woodsy property where the patient had been living. None of the trapped animals tested positive for the virus.

In 2020 and 2021, after additional cases were identified, Olson, Newell and others fanned out into the woods in the Fairbanks area, where they trapped hundreds of small mammals of different species and tested them. Of the nearly 400 animals trapped and tested, 16% had antibodies showing past exposure to the virus and 5% had active infections of it, according to information presented by Newell at a CDC conference last year.

Northern red-backed voles dominated that group that tested positive, which made sense, Olson said.

Found in almost all of the state, they are extremely abundant — “one of Alaska’s most ubiquitous and common species,” according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s species profile – so a lot of them wound up in the traps the scientists used to detect virus presence in small mammals. They also have very short lifespans, generally no more than 12 months, so they might not have time to overcome any viral infections they acquire, leaving those viruses still active when the animals are tested.

There is no evidence that Alaskapox/borealpox has harmed the animals it infected, Newell said. Among the hundreds of small mammals trapped, there was not even a single lesion, she said.

As for potential harm to people, the virus was considered to pose little threat, at least until the fatal Kenai Peninsula case occurred.

In the six Fairbanks North Star Borough cases, initial signs of infection were lesions that resembled spider bites, she said. In those Fairbanks-area cases, all among otherwise healthy people, symptoms included fatigue, swollen lymph nodes and fever – possibly uncomfortable, but not dangerous. All the Fairbanks patients recovered, some within a few days, though the skin lesions took longer to heal completely, according to state information.

In the aftermath of the fatal case, the Alaska Division of Health’s epidemiology section issued a set of recommendations that include extra precautions for people with compromised immune systems. State epidemiologists are also urging more public awareness, prompt reporting of any suspected cases and careful behavior around wild animals.

There is no evidence that the virus can spread between people. Pet dogs and cats that mingle with or prey on infected wild animals are considered possible transmitters. The Fairbanks-area patients owned pets, and the Kenai Peninsula man who eventually succumbed to the virus had been caring for a stray cat before his symptoms emerged, state health officials have noted.

Much more investigation is planned, including an expedition this summer to the Kenai Peninsula to trap and test animals there, Newell said. More discoveries of the virus are expected, she said.

“Until we had our fatal case in January of this year, people probably weren’t looking for it much,” Newell said.

Many questions remain unanswered. Among them: What other animal species, including bigger and longer-lived species, are carrying the Alaskapox/borealpox virus? Is there a reason why infections are just now showing up in people – or were there human cases in the past that went undiagnosed? How widespread is the virus in space, time and across various animal species?

Olson, who has just sent 100 specimen samples up to 20 years old to the CDC for testing, suspects that investigation into the last question will reveal much wider reach than originally believed.

“We should have never called it ‘Alaskapox,’” he said. And though he had advocated for the borealpox name from the start, even that may wind up being obsolete, he said. “I’ll go on record predicting it’s probably not going to be limited to the boreal region.”"|Alaska|2024|True|0
"From 2000-2004 my elder cousin was a volunteer Firefighter in Fairbanks Ak. The station was right down the street from our house, not even a 5 min walk. When they'd get a call we could hear the alarm from our house, that was our cue. Any time of day or night, if we were home and heard the bell, we go to the station, you could just walk in. We would move all their stuff all over the place and find silly ways to mess with them, but we always left behind gifts like beer and candy along with ""thank you for your service"" messages on the white board.

""Alaska is facing an energy crisis, and AGDC is exploring every option to deliver a new, affordable, reliable, and long-term energy supply.

"We've been renting this place for 2 years now, renewing yearly. The lease will end around New Year's, but the property manager started asking in September (about 4 months in advance to the lease end!) whether we plan to renew. 

Yes we do, but she kept asking for how long and at what price. [Realestate.com.au](http://Realestate.com.au) and similar sites only show availability 6 weeks in advance; that will be mid-November. So we're over 2 months too early to get an idea of the market. I said so, but she keeps pushing. I proposed a 6 month renewal for the current price, she wants a higher price for 12 months. It starts to look on the higher side of current prices, but OK I guess to avoid the cost of moving. 

So I'm wanting to tell her that we're OK in principle with that offer, but we won't sign anything until mid-November when we can actually start to check the market, and to please piss off until then. 

**My question is:** how come they get so pushy *so early*? Can they do anything to force us to decide so early? I *imagine* they could get petty and somehow decide they don't want to renew us, but I *hope* that, just like the process of moving would be costly and uncomfortable for us, it would also be some friction for them, right? 

Even, is there anywhere I could complain about this pressure?

For context, this PM has always been starting the renewal process early and I always have had to push back a bit; last year it was 3 months early. But this is getting silly. 4 months!"|brisbane|2024|False|0

I also did Port Arthur and Cataract Gorge today.

"Hi Montanans! I'm from England, but a little over a hundred years ago my family decided to try and make it ""out West"" in the mines of Montana. What I know about their time here is, however, very limited and I was hoping than some of you might be able to shed any light on it.

In 1883 or 1884, my great-great-grandfather George Tuckett set sail from his home in Yorkshire (where he had been an iron miner) for Butte, Montana. Thereafter he appears in pretty much every town directory as a miner (or assistant) until 1901 or so. That included the Gagnon Mine (which I have found photos of) and also the ""Mt V"" mine - are any of you able to identify that particular abbreviation?

In 1885, my great-great-grandmother Annie took herself and their three children Alice (b. 1879), Elizabeth Anne (b. 1883) and George (b. 1884). It appears that little Elizabeth did not survive the journey, or otherwise died shortly after arriving.

Carrie Hammond Tuckett, my great-grandmother, was born in Montana in 1892 but three months later the family seems to have been split, with Carrie, Alice and their father George still there, but Annie and George Jr not. I surmise during this period Annie was in a lunatic asylum, perhaps with George. (Ten years later, back in England, she was again committed and her doctor noted her previous incarceration while in the States) - though I have no record of this and I would be very grateful if there was any way of verifying it.

George was naturalised as a US Citizen in 1894 followed by the birth of Nina Tuckett (b.1894) and Bert (b.1897). By 1901 Annie and the children (all?) appear to be back in England, though George is not - they are ""separated"" and it appears he thought twice about his marital status on the 1900 US Census. (The children, for their part, pretended to be Canadian for the 1901 UK census!)

I have only very incomplete records of what I know must be several transatlantic trips from Ancestry - would there be any other ways to verify comings and goings? I understand the 1890 census records are lost, and that birth/death records were not common at the time."|Montana|2017|False|0

On December 25, 2024, I was driving home from my girlfriend’s place when my car’s brakes locked up, causing the airbags to deploy and completely immobilizing the vehicle. I had to call a specialized tow truck to take it to my mechanic. I won’t even go into the full repair costs, but I’m looking at about $700 just for a new wheel and column.

This car was not only my daily transportation but also how I earned extra income through DoorDash and Uber. With the car out of commission, my side income has been completely wiped out. I even reached out to my father for help, but unfortunately, he’s unable to assist.

My rent ($1,800) is due on the 1st, along with my water and electricity bills, which total about $260. These are final notices, and I’ve already pushed them as far as I can without losing services. I do get paid on January 2nd, and I’ll be making close to $800, plus holiday pay and extra hours, which will bring my total to around $900. However, this will only be enough to cover the bills, basic essentials, and gas—not my rent.

I’ve been working 8-12 hours after my full-time job to try to make some extra money, but it’s barely enough to cover gas, let alone everything else. I don’t have many friends or family to turn to, so I’m at a loss for what to do.

I hate asking for help—it makes me feel embarrassed—but I’m out of options. If anyone can help in any way, I would truly appreciate it more than words can express. My CashApp is $pingodingo.

Thank you so much for reading this, and may God bless you all. Anything helps, and I’m beyond grateful for your kindness."|Florida|2024|False|0

Hi, I’m not with any shelters or anything and I’m not sure where else to put this but I’ve been searching for dogs since my other one passed suddenly and I’ve found a lot that are old or have special needs that need homes and I just feel so bad seeing them not have homes.

"At ~6:30 AM, my husband noticed that something was wrong with the small fish pond in our yard. The lily pads were torn, the usually crystal clear water was brown, and the 2 larger goldfish were nowhere in sight. We quickly realized that the larger fish (5"") were completely missing as were several other small fish (1-2""). The pond sits beneath an orange tree and our yard is secured by a 6' block wall. The fatalities occurred some time between 9PM and 6AM.

What murdered our fish? A hawk? A heron? A raccoon? (Do raccoons even live in Phoenix?) The neighbors's cat?

"I'm not sure if this is what this subreddit is for, but I thought I would try to post this in my state's subreddit.
If this doesn't fit this subreddit,I'll delete it. 

I live in Charleston, West Virginia. My neighbors, who have lived on my street for as long as I can remember, recently moved suddenly for an unknown reason, leaving behind two cats. One is an older cat, who would not be suitable for adoption as a family pet. Another neighbor is looking for a rescue group to take him. The other cat is Emma.
I don't know if Emma is her real name, but that's what I call her. She has medium to long black fur with chocolate highlights. She has short legs, but not as short as the legs of a cat of the Munchkin breed, although I think she may be part munchkin. She has white teeth, so I am assuming she is young, at the most one year. I don't know her health history, nor do I know if she was spayed. 
Emma is a very affectionate cat who purrs and follows me on walks. She gets along with the neighborhood cats but seems to have a fear of dogs. I think she was an indoor cat. I'm worried about how she will survive in the dangers of being outside. She doesn't deserve to live her life as a stray.

One of the main differences I noticed between cities like Milwaukee and Chicago is that Twin Cities freeways are more of a grid network than a hub and spoke network radiating from downtown which gives you more alternative routes. The next thing I noticed when I moved here was the proliferation of the cloverleaf interchange, a relic of 1950s highway design, and while Chicago still uses them in the exurbs, Milwaukee is upgrading the very last one to a diverging diamond. Initially, I thought, surely this isn’t the best idea for a city with icy winters, to have sharp curves with short distances for merging? Doing some nerdy research, I found this graphic, and I fell in love with it.

>""We're just going to try to get things done,"" she said.

>She said the DFL will move quickly in January to protect abortion access. Another priority will be what she called ""helping Minnesotans afford their lives"": money toward education, environmental protection, affordable housing and child care.

No mention of cannabis legalization at all.  I'm not sure if this is because she's actively avoiding the subject, its truly not a priority for her or whether its just a failure of journalism to not ask about one of the more talked about legislative issues.

My girlfriend is planning to move down from Connecticut with me in Austin but she is concerned about healthcare down here. Up in CT, she qualified for free state health insurance where she had no medical expenses. All of her prescriptions were free, doctors visits had no copays, dental was covered, and there was no deductible or monthly fees that she needed to pay. However after doing a bit of research, I can't find any information for similar programs down here. It seems like all public insurance plans require monthly payments and/or high deductibles.

# 🤔 So what’s this all about?

Over the next 6 weeks, we'll draft the *latest* Magic sets, go wild with *chaos drafts* (you can thank me later), and wrap it all up with a grand finale that’s more exciting than finding a Mythic rare in your pack (if that's possible). 

Here’s the best part: You don’t have to make it to every single week! Don’t stress if you miss one. Your lowest performing event is automatically dropped, including a missed event.

# PRIZES:

* **Top 4 at each table:** Win sweet, sweet prizes. I’m talking *cards, swag, maybe even a shiny new R*C car or something. Who knows?
* **Top 4 by overall points at the end of the league:** Cash prize! Who doesn’t love some extra loot? 💰
* **1st place overall:** In addition to the cash, you can win an **exclusive play mat**. Yes, it’s as cool as it sounds. ;)

We’ll also have giveaways, side contests, and other surprise prizes because we want to keep it fun, inclusive, and *sometimes a little chaotic...* just like Magic itself.

# WHY:

* **Community:** We’re not just a bunch of players, *we’re a community* of passionate people*.* I’m all about creating a welcoming space where new players can learn the ropes, and veterans can share their knowledge and compete. It’s about growth, mentorship, and making sure we’re all having a blast while we sling spells and crack packs.
* **No Pressure:** Whether this is your first draft or your 100th, this is for *everybody*. You play at your pace, and I promise, *you’ll feel at home*.
* **Mentoring is encouraged!** Got some drafting tips? Want to show off your ""sick combos""? I couldn't encourage it more.



**TL;DR**: The **Boise Magic Draft League** is a 6-week tournament where you draft new sets, crazy formats, chaos drafts, and drink beer at local breweries. You can win cash prizes, a cool playmat, and join a community of Magic players that you'll dig. We want you to be part of this! (Seriously, come play. It's going to be awesome. You don't want to miss it.)

"I just came across Boise Dev's ""[Treasure Valley Happy Hour Guide](https://boisedev.com/guides/happy-hour-guide-2/)"" article and thought it was pretty cool. But it reminded me of our last visit to Water Bear Bar's happy hour.

We got there right at 4 PM, and the music was upbeat but not overpowering. About 10 minutes later, though, the volume cranked up so much that the four of us were practically yelling to hear each other (and no, it's not because we're old). When we asked the server if they could turn the music back down, he flat-out said, ""No, we don't do that."" Seriously, does happy hour come with megaphones now?

If you know of any happy hour spots where you can actually hold a conversation without competing with the music, let me know!

so this happened not even 10 minutes ago, i was doordashing as i usually do when im bored. so im delivering an order and im driving down chinden about to turn on curtis then onto ustick. and i noticed something in the sky that just looked like a plane so i just ignored it. but taking a second glance i noticed it wasn't flashing like a normal plane would in the night. so i kept my eye on it while i was sitting at the light (for a total of about 2 minutes), it had strange flight patterns and it moved very quickly. one second it in the sky like a plane would be, and the next it's RIGHT ABOVE MY CAR! it's about 10 feet away from my windshield. it was a triangular shape orb and emitted a really bright green, i've never seen that shade of green in my entire life. i was mesmerised. typing this out now i wish i had taken a picture of it but i seriously couldn't take my eyes off it. what y'all think? |Boise|2024|False|0

"Starting August 1st, there will not be an in network insurance provider on the marketplace, that will have the nationally ranked Cincinnati Children's Hospital in network. This Hospital provides specialized care to thousands of children through out Ohio.  Care source marketplace plan has decided not to include them Cincinnati Children's as part of their in network plan.  This will result in the following 
1. Continuing with current doctors but paying significantly more out of pocket for care for their children
2. Switching doctors, possibly in the middle of care, and forcing parents to drive hours away for that care.
3. Just not getting the care their child needs because there is no one in network to provide it.

"As of this month the state is now not only a “stand your ground” state, but also permitless carry, meaning state-mandated training or a background check to legally carry guns is optional, and gun nuts also have the option to openly carry because God says it’s okay.

When it comes to America’s gun fetish there’s too much blame to go around, but arguably the biggest gun-pusher trap house in Ohio is the Ohio Statehouse, as its dominating GOP leadership apparently wants an AR-15 slung over everyone’s shoulder.

The below picture was taken at a Columbus grocery store. True, grocery stores are targets for active shooters, but must we all be openly carrying so to put an end to active shooters?

"The title is somewhat self-explanatory. I'm a 21 year old student from Chicago, Illinois, and I'm considering working next summer in the fishing industry, either as a greenhorn or in a processing plant. Only problem? All I've got to go by are anecdotes. I know it's brutal, dirty, often dangerous work, but is what people say about the money that's there true? I've been interested in trying it for a while, and I'm thinking this year's going to be the one I do it. I don't have any experience with the fishing industry (being from Chicago and all), but I'm interested in learning, I'm not afraid of 16 hour days of hard work (spent a year in the construction industry before going to school), I can cook fairly well, I don't get seasick, and I'm a fast learner. Most of all though, I've got nothing to lose and nothing keeping me here. Spending a summer working in Alaska would help me pay for college and take some steps towards financial independence and making something of myself. 

Long story short, this year has not been too kind to me. I had a very serious long term relationship end, my relationship with my parents (whom I'm still financially dependent on) has been taking a turn for the worst, and my financial situation has changed to the point where if I have to take out loans I'm going to spend years paying for them on a teacher's salary. I'm sick of being financially dependent on my parents, terrified of going into debt, afraid I'll be 30 and still living at home, and sick of being almost 22 and having nothing to show for it, while my friends are all settling down and moving on with their lives. Having said that, I'm not going to sit around feeling sorry for myself, and trying to find work up here is my plan for improving my lot. I know there's no way to really prepare yourself for what you're getting into, but the ability to  (hopefully) make several thousand dollars over the course of a summer would literally be a life changing opportunity to me. 

What I'm really wondering is how to actually get my foot in the door as a greenhorn? I've heard working as a processor sucks but if it means getting some experience I'm willing to hold my nose and power through a few months. I've heard that you typically need to know someone in order to get a job on a boat. Should I start as a processor, try to find something online, or should I take a leap of faith and actually start hitting the pavement up in Alaska? 

Any insights would be much appreciated."|Alaska|2019|True|0
"So as the title says, I'm looking for help with a project of mine. I'm creating a sci-fi series with nations made up of various geographical regions across Earth. The one I'm working on now is called Vesperia, it was formed by the various nations of the Arctic Circle, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia.

To get to the point, I'm trying to name things within the Vesperian Confederation, cities, towns, schools, military and naval stations, starship fleets, exploration vessels and the like. I'm trying to name things after historical figures (explorers, scientists, war heroes, politicians and activists), as well as culturally significant places (heritage sites, natural landmarks like mountains and rivers, and places of legend from mythos).
I've done a lot of research but I figured I'd ask some people who are actually from Alaska, who are some well respected historical figures that I might want to name a city or university after, or some heritage sites I could pay homage to, and what are some well known natural or historical landmarks I could use to name things?"|Alaska|2019|False|0

"Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses. My team and I learned a lot about your situation and we hope any final product we develop can be used to assist you. Currently, we are beginning work on our version of a hydroponics system. If our project reaches maturity before the end of our time together as a team, we will reach out to a few specific locations. Unfortunately, considering the circumstances that this project is only one semester long, I don’t realistically see us reaching this point.


Hi everyone! I'm a student at Purdue University working on a project about food scarcity. I've heard from a number of sources that imported food in Alaska can sometimes be prohibitively expensive. My team is exploring the possibility of supplementing the availability of vegetables with hydroponics systems. For those who don't know, hydroponics systems are used to grow vegetables without soil in racks that can be stacked vertically to optimize space. They are efficient, low-budget, and can save money over time by reducing the need for buying or importing vegetables. 

So my question is, would you be interested in a small, low-cost hydroponics system in your home to supplement vegetables purchased at the store? Or a large hydroponics system for your town to increase the availability of vegetables in the community? Or is this a non-issue that doesn't need to be addressed?

I would really appreciate any and all responses. Thank you!"|Alaska|2022|False|0

Apparently, the ferry doesn't get its official summer schedule (starting May or thereabouts) until sometime in the next few weeks, though I am not sure if I misunderstood. I was planning to leave from Bellingham to Whittier, which seems quite pricey according to the example fare.

I drive a 2018 Honda Civic, and ideally, I'd like my car with me. I was leaning more toward taking the drive up instead, as it seems more cost-effective.

1. Where is the best place to live if I want to be close to nature, but is also generally affordable? Could you tell me a bit about the area you suggest too?

2. What is the most difficult part about living in RI? What are some things you hate about it? 

3. What do you love about living there? Why wouldn't you ever want to leave?  

4. I know I'm getting into the cosmetology industry, but my Husband currently works in marine construction. Sea walls and docks. What is the construction industry like in RI? What sort of jobs are available in RI? What industries can he look into for work?

5. Here in Florida I live in fear of the wild life (a water moccasin chased me in my parking lot not that long ago, I've had snakes fall from the sky onto my patio, i've had alligators in my back yard), I want to live close to nature.

(Please excuse me if I come off like a noob)

Looking for some advice on proper hiking footwear for myself and girlfriend. We recently got into hiking and are obsessed. We want to three-season day hike, primarily. We’ve been to Kearsarge, Monadnock, and plan to continue to explore the the many options and difficulties in New Hampshire, hopefully leading to 4ks and the best day hike trails the state offers.

We both have a pair of mid-hiking boots now, I don’t have any quarrels. They feel safe secure and breatheable, little heavy. My girlfriend has stated she has some pain/uncomfortable and they’re heavy. I forgot the brand off hand but they’re quality boots that many others had on the trails we’ve been on. I am wondering if she’d benefit from a a shoe or trail runner.

I just want some fellow NH hikers feedback on trail hikers vs hiking shoes vs hiking boots. We want to continue to progress and are interested in 2-6 hour day hikes and continue to escalate difficulties /distances/elevations.

>Osterholm says. ""I liken it to trying to plant your petunias in the middle of a Category 5 hurricane.""

What he was actually saying was 

>Testing, contact tracing and isolation are the tactics being used successfully to crush outbreaks in countries such as South Korea and Germany. But those places never had the level of case surges that many U.S. states are now experiencing.

>""When you have something like this happening, there's no way that traditional testing and tracing is going to have any meaningful impact,"" Osterholm says. 

> At this point, there are just too many new infections occurring too quickly for underfunded, understaffed public health departments to effectively use testing and contract tracing, according to Dr. Jeffrey Engel, the senior adviser for the COVID-19 response for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

Futhermore, the Rep from Johns Hopkins stated

>""Given our basic failure to fix the gaps in testing and the bottlenecks, that really puts us on a path where there is no viable alternative beyond shutdowns,"" says Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

>Now, Nuzzo doesn't think all hope is lost. If enough people finally start wearing masks, and get vigilant about staying at least 6 feet away from other people, especially indoors, there may still be hope in at least some places of avoiding new shutdowns, she says.

When asked what would work, Osterholm says

"Hey /r/Denver,

Travel nurse from California coming from \~12/1 to 3/1 for an assignment at Colorado Children's Hospital in Aurora.

Problem is I currently drive a Civic Type R, FWD, manual, basically no clearance, a wheel size incompatible with most/all winter tires etc. Thus, I'm looking to rent an AWD car for 1. everyone's safety and 2. make it up to the slopes without issue on my off-days. 

Just looking to get a community opinion on what my viable options are? Traditional rental car companies (Budget, Avis, Hertz etc.) and renting through Turo are essentially out of the question as it would be around $4k for the 3 mos.

Current ideas:  


* Ask someone on Turo to take it off-platform for a long-term rental (skip the middle-man, long term ""secured"" income)
* Ask someone selling a beater WRX, Outback on Craigslist to rent out to me for the 3 months.
* Buy a complete winter setup for my car (downsize to 18s, wrap them in winters) and just live close to the hospital and try to bum rides to the mountains on ski days.
* Ask someone here if they have a spare AWD car laying around?  


Mainly asking if these are realistic options and the culture of Denver-ites renting out to outsiders and if this is a common thing or what other solutions you all might have. TIA."|Denver|2020|False|0

"I have questions about the ice sculptures tomorrow night.
TLDR: Are there two different ice sculpture events, and where exactly should I plan to be to see them?

On the official [First Night website](https://www.firstnightboston.org/ice-sculptures/) it says ""Sculptures will be located in City Hall Plaza and available for public viewing from noon on December 31 to 12:30 AM on January 1."" 
But later it says ""Also, we’re excited to again be teamed up with Boston Harbor Now for their annual Ice Sculpture Stroll. Check out the below map to see where the sculptures will be set up."" And this map shows pins all over the city from Roxbury to Beachmont. 
I'm just very confused because are the sculptures going to be in one location or all around the city? Or are both true and there are two separate events one being First Night and one being Ice Sculpture Stroll? Or is it that the sculptures go from the plaza and get moved to the ""stroll"" locations later on?

Well now I don't have a girl but that's okay as long as he has a girl I want the guy to be Caucasian no older than me but not young. Between 40 and 50 for both male and female male must be completely shaved and circumcised the size of his cock doesn't matter to me as long as it looks good and he's clean as I am. The female should also be shaved and enjoy watching me do this.  I would obviously prefer this to actually happen in person and hoping maybe it could but for now I will settle for doing it here I do not consider myself gay because I am not gay I do not want to have intercourse unless it's the right time I prefer this couple to indulge and what I indulge in and to feel comfortable and what's going on. I am very good at role play and obviously very good in person I'm here waiting so as soon as this couple is ready hit me up oh yeah by the way the mail should be fit I don't want some fat f*** the female I prefer to be a little bit on the chubby side but really doesn't matter as long as she shaves and is good at what she does and wants to be there to do it not because she has to but because she wants to|SouthCarolina|2024|False|0

"Memorial Day weekend my girlfriend and I are visiting my sister in North Carolina.  Tuesday am we are headed out and want to be at my friend’s house in folly beach by Wednesday night.  I’m an outdoorsman but haven’t explored much down south.  I was intrigued by both Congaree NP and woods bay state park.    My original thought was to either leave super early Tuesday, drive 3 hours, and do a canoe trip at Congaree Tuesday and then camp overnight,  or hit up something like woods bay Tuesday on the way to Congaree, camp and kayak Wednesday.

I was assuming it would make more sense to rent kayaks than haul them down there in my truck, but I’m open to both, as we also plan on doing some kayaking once we are in folly.  I would just want a reasonably clear idea on where to kayak as I’ve heard kayaking down south can be a bit more maze like than up north.  I’d need a shuttle at the very least.

feel free to tell me that any of this is a bad idea, or to steer me in a different direction. maybe skip woods bay and zip straight to Congaree and maximize our time there.  or perhaps skip both and do something entirely different.  Or do a short stop at Congaree and save kayaking for after we arrive at folly beach?

suggestions on what to do, where to camp, where to kayak, rent kayaks, etc. would be awesome!

thanks so much!"|SouthCarolina|2021|False|0

2. What is the likely outcome from all of this fighting, in your opinion?

"Hi there, I'm a new driver in Sydney (a full fledged driver back in my Southeast Asian home) and would like to seek more clarification on the way red light cameras work around here.

From the Red-light speed camera FAQs I got this:
""The red-light detection function of the cameras is connected to the traffic lights and is activated when a vehicle crosses the white stop line after the lights have turned red.""

So what if your vehicle was already halfway past the line at the intersection? Let's say while waiting for the opposite traffic to stop so you could make a turn you have already crossed the line halfway before the light turns red and your back tires cross the stop line just as the light turns red, does this count as an offence?

"Hi, I'm Alex Rozier, Mississippi Today's data and environment reporter. I've been covering the ongoing issues with Jackson, Mississippi's water system, which recently culminated in a citywide failure that left thousands of citizens with [little to no clean running water](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/08/29/jackson-water-system-fails-emergency/) amongst a boil water notice that is now no longer in effect.

In the wake of the city's water system failure, our newsroom brought all hands on deck to cover how the water crisis was and is impacting every beat that we cover. We answered some frequently asked questions [earlier this month](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/08/31/jackson-water-crisis-faq/), but now I'd love to hear what you all still need to know. I'll be answering your questions this Friday at noon!

Here's a little more about what's happened since the water system failure, its eventual return to function and the end of the boil water notice:

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, along with his chief financial officer, Fidelis Malembeka, pushed back against recent news stories questioning [how prepared the city leadership](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/14/town-hall-mayor-lumumba/) is to tackle the current crisis. Specifically, they defended against the idea that the [city lacks a plan](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/08/jackson-water-plan-mayor-state-solution/), or that it doesn’t truly know how much it would cost to fix the water system. 

And on Monday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan again met with Mayor Lumumba, this time alongside the U.S. Department of Justice, to plot the [next course of action](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/26/epa-feds-prepared-to-take-action-on-jackson-water/) over the city’s water system.

"After some suggesting from fellow redditors, I've decided to switch my plans from Lake Hamilton to Lake Ouachita.

I am interested in the state park, hiking, biking, swimming, canoeing and kayaking.

The goal of this trip is just to check out the place since I've never been before. I want to visit it before I invite my immediate family on the trip.

For this trip in particular, I plan on visiting for one day only and am aware that I can only do so much, so I've finalized that I want to go kayaking or canoeing (depending on which one I feel like this weekend) and hiking.

Here are some of the more specific questions I have regarding this trip:

* Are there any must-visit coves or secluded spots for kayaking or canoeing?
* For canoeing and kayaking, which rental service would you recommend?
   * Preface: I do not have my own paddles or a life jacket
* What are any good local places for food lunch and dinner?

Has anyone ever had to pay fines or fees in this state? I had a $250 misdemeanor fine from two years ago that has long been paid, but apparently there were $30 in late fee charges that no one ever made an attempt to collect or notify me about. Fast forward two years later - the district court of Searcy had been charging $10 a month for a late fee ON the late fee, totaling $240 in fees that they refused to remove! As far as I'm aware these fines would have continued to accumulate forever, or at least until they thought they had enough to issue a warrant for arrest. Of course, hiring a lawyer would cost more than the two years of fees, so it's basically pay the money or let us continue tightening your noose.

"Hey All,

Hoping I can gather some advice for an issue I’m having with my electric bill...the issue being that it’s absolutely fucking stupid high. 

Moved into a new apartment in Arvada June 30th. It’s a garden level unit in a condo complex, 1100 sq ft. 2bd2ba. It’s a bit older but seems to be decently insulated. Has Central air, and we have kept at a modest 72 ish all summer (although now we have taken to turning it off every time we leave). We’re pretty conservative with our electric use, turning off lights etc. we’re both busy people and are out of the house often. 

Got our electric for the first month, July. 230 freaking dollars. I’m absolutely floored. Our last apartment, of similar size but with 3 people and even higher AC usage, was never more than like $70 a month. Clearly something is VERY wrong here! Our total usage for the month was 1665 kWh. My parents, who have a 3000+ sq. Ft house, used 1000 kWh for the same time period! Insane. 

Just got our August usage. AGAIN $230! I call Xcel and they give me the “oh we have different rates for higher usage blah blah” I’m like yeah I can read a freaking electric bill that doesn’t explain why the usage is so high. They tell me the average for last 12 months for our unit is $80, as I expected. 

I look around our building to find the electric meter so I can monitor it myself. it’s nowhere to be found. I email the landlord and explain our problem, they don’t know either. I call the HOA and the ONE PERSON who knows where the meter is is on vacation. why is this so difficult???

I guess our only option would be to have Xcel come out and do some testing or whatever to figure out exactly what the fuck is going on here. Because there is no way in HELL we are using $200+ of electricity per month. 

Thanks for reading. Anyone have any advice here or been in a similar situation??"|Denver|2019|False|0

"Been busting my ass trying to get a job for close to a year now, but have also been focused on being a caregiver with my mom with cancer and suffering from strokes.  Been working on my CPA studies in the meantime, and have put myself in 60k of debt by doing so.  There is no laziness here.  I was supposed to work at Nestle in August, was ""hired in,"" but then let go immediately without ever setting foot in the door due to them hiring too many people for the project after waiting two months for my start date in October (waited August to October).  Been working with recruiting agencies in Aerotek, Aston Carter, Kelly Services, CFS, and Robert Half trying to get something going since.  Every week, basically every day.  I've put in about 500 applications on ZipRecruiter alone, counting right now.  This is ignoring Indeed, CareerBuilder, Handshake, etc.  I was supposed to work at Securitas two weeks ago in a Staff Accountant position before it was cancelled due to COVID.  I was supposed to work at Airborne in Akron as a Staff Accountant, with immediate need, through Kelly Services, last week.  Cancelled due to COVID.

I. Have. Tried. To. Work. Constantly.

I have put applications in for fields unrelated to accounting in the last few months.

What am I supposed to do?  I don't qualify for Unemployment due to not being employed, correct?  Is there something, anything here, to help?  I just talked to everyone AGAIN and no one has any available jobs whatsoever.  

I'm about to be homeless due to our landlord dying and them selling the house / them moving in in two days.  I can't get a job.  I can't find anywhere to rent due to this.  My mom is extremely high risk and it feels like everything I sacrificed and work towards since 2012, when my dad was killed and I went to college to give my mom a good life, is now pointless.  My degree is not helping whatsoever.  My immense debt to help my mom is now for nothing if she gets sick.  I can't use my CPA exam studies if I don't have a year of experience.  I cannot get income in any facet.  I am so lost, stressed, and panicking.  

Anyone have advice?"|Ohio|2020|True|1
I filed yesterday. I know some other people have had this issue, but it’s saying that my SSN does not match my surname (it definitely does). They’re asking for copies of my SS card and birth certificate, no problem, I have those. But has anyone had this issue resolved? I’m going to submit copies in a few minutes but I just don’t understand why it’s even saying that because they do absolutely match. The only thing I can think of is I didn’t put my middle name on the application because it wasn’t asterisked. Stupid, I know, I should have just put it down but thought it was optional.|Ohio|2020|False|0

2:03 PM: The Governor begins speaking

Reminder that businesses and customers are obligated to observe social distancing guidelines. Businesses must also ensure that the environment their employees work in is clean and healthy. 

Jobs Ohio is a great organization that helps with job creation in our state. We are planning for the upcoming bad economy in order to ensure that Ohioans will not be as badly affected by unemployment. Jobs Ohio is working in those hardest hit by bad economy in order to allow companies to remain open or begin operation. They are focusing on small businesses. 

Dr. Acton will be issuing an order today in order to track where ventilators are and how many we have. This will streamline the process to ensure we know how bad our shortage may or may not be. We are working to secure more ventilators along with that process. Devices that may also be used to treat sleep apnea should also be reported, including Cpap and Bpap machines. Ventilators owned for personal use need not be reported. 

Since March 12th, employees working for the state have been working from home whenever possible. I have ordered state agencies to continue that process until at least May 1st. I have also ordered them to look into moving even more into working from home.

The state has required that water utilities must continue serving customers, even without payment, for as long as this crisis is considered ongoing.

Battelle and Ohio State University have developed a new, rapid test system that will be capable of processing 200 tests every day. This number might increase to 1,000 as infrastructure improves.

New technology is being innovated and is coming online. This is only possible because we are slowing the spread of the virus. 

Mental health is very important during this time period. We will be having a brief explanation of things you can do to keep yourself healthy mentally during this time.

2:19 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_________________________________________________
2:20 PM: Lori Criss begins speaking 

We are working with the homeless in order to give them a place to call home during this period. 

We highly recommend that you keep to a new routine and keep everything rather scheduled.

Keep in contact with your friends, family, and neighbors, especially those who live alone will keep everyone healthier.

If you are facing trouble with keeping yourself stocked on food and other important items, we are working on fixing that issues and many places may be able to help you now.

Keep in contact with your primary care doctor and if you are experiencing addiction, feel free to look into resources for help.

If you are religious or spiritual, keep in contact with your leaders.

Taking time to listen to nature or being out in nature is important for mental health as well.

Make sure you keep a balance between work and and social time. 

The state has created volunteer opportunities for those who have time to help during this period. 

Set boundaries for yourself so that you can take care of your needs whenever you need to.

It is important to remember that school is a community for children. Make sure to create opportunities for your children to socialize with their peers while practicing social distancing. 

Monitor the media that your children are browsing and answer their questions and concerns honestly.

If you were recovering from or dealing with alcoholism or other addiction, make sure to keep in contact with your recovery support groups.

Reach out and support those living with mental illness.

Seek serenity to accept the things we cannot change. Courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 

2:32 PM: Lori Criss stops speaking

2:32 PM: Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

Right before I walked into this room, I spoke to the the entire technology sector relating to unemployment and I made sure they understood that there is a lot of frustration with the current system. I wanted to give them a sense of urgency. They told me they had already increased the system by 20X and I informed them that it was not enough. I am doing everything I can and they are doing everything they can as well. This is not something that can be fixed in moments. We are listening to those of you who are voicing your frustrations. Please do not focus those frustrations on those who are working in the unemployment system. They are doing as much as they can. They have processed more people in the past two weeks than they have over the past two years.

On insurance, employers who cannot pay their premiums have been given a grace period. COVID-19 is covered under insurance and all hospitals in Ohio should be covered equally by all health care insurance providers.

We are always on the phone with the leaders throughout the economic and health sphere, trying to get everything fixed where necessary.

2:41 PM: The Lieutenant Governor stops speaking
_______________________________________________
2:41 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

2,199 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 585 hospitalizations, 55 deaths, 29,191 total tested. 

429 health care workers have been confirmed to be infected with coronavirus. This is 20% of the total.

A recent study focusing on mitigation measures taken in Italy found that there is a major difference between the hardest hit region of Italy and the lesser affected regions. 

No one person or president is at fault. A quote from the article is, ""This virus is faster than any bureaucracy."" Despite this, I feel that Ohio has done the most we can to fight this virus. 

We are building a response to both the surge we are expecting and a community-based response to keep everyone involved in the process. 

I feel confident that we have made the right choices based on our models. Even models that disagree with ours agree that social distancing is essential to slowing down the spread of the virus. We have to be prepared for the storm. We are looking into the worst case and the best case but the most important part of this is keeping increasing supplies in our hospital in order to keep capacity as low as possible. This is the calm before the storm, we're minimizing our use of hospital beds and other supplies, while maximizing their production.

Every time you go out, be vigilant, and be safe. Follow social distancing rules and listen to guidelines given to you by businesses regarding social distancing.

2:53 PM: Amy Acton stops speaking 
______________________________________________________
2:53 PM: Question period begins

Have you received any response from the education community about extending the school closures? What about to families of those students?

Governor: When we began these orders we understood that people would become unemployed or be on the edge of financial trouble or worse. This is the type of response that was necessary and I understand that people are making sacrifices. I have not had any direct conversation from superintendents but we are continuing dialogue. 

I'd like to have everything go back to normal but I cannot do that yet without putting everyone at risk. This is a once in 100 years event.
___________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: Have you changed your mind on your views in terms of the prison system?

Governor: Our prison system has the best interests of both the prisoners and their workers. We have been reviewing if there are prisoners who did not commit violent crimes and are nearing the end of their sentence. There are things that we will never do but we are looking into making decisions on a case by case basis. We have an obligation to both the prisoners and staff in prisons but we also have an obligation to those out of prison.
___________________________________________________________
3:00 PM: How many tests can the state lab handle each day? What is limiting our testing ability?

Amy Acton: Testing is still limited in supply. Our lab can do 280 tests every day and this takes around eight hours. Cleveland Clinic, Ohio State University, and hospitals throughout the state are also working on this. We do not have enough test kits still. There is a new type of testing being worked on called point of care testing. We have a team working on getting that testing as quickly as possible. We are doing everything we can. 

We're working on expanding our investigation force that's looking into the infection spread through contact tracing. We're also looking into technological answers to that issue.

Governor: Hospitals, do not send your tests to places that may take five or more days to get through them. Send them to our Department of Health lab or a hospital with a quick turnaround time.
____________________________________________________________________
3:06 PM: What do you think of the use of homemade masks that seems to be spreading? Do you think Ohioans should begin doing that?

Amy Acton: The CDC is measuring the benefit of wearing masks. In Ohio, we are already recommending you expect that you are infected and so I wonder if it will be necessary for us. I won't rule out that it won't be useful. We have seen the mask-wearing in Asia that possibly helps prevent the spread of disease and we will continuing looking into that.
____________________________________________________________________________
3:09 PM: What has your experience acquiring ventilators been like?

Governor: The other states have about the same experience as us but we are looking into having our own businesses produce ventilators for us. We're taking every opportunity to increase our supply. 

Lieutenant Governor:  I wanted to mention that Battelle has sanitized 3,500 masks and is working on ramping up on that.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:11 PM: Question on pre-employment drug screening

Amy Acton: I did not even think about that issue and I will be reflecting on that in the coming days.

Governor: We do not know exactly what the private labs are doing. All we can do is tell hospitals to send their tests to places that have quick turnaround.
________________________________________________________________
3:13 PM: Could there be an increase in medical error? Are any steps being taken to help those who may deal with medical malpractice?

Amy Acton: This is uncharted territory but we are working on this issue. Safety guidelines are being followed from what I can see. This sort of situation does give an increased risk of issues but no one has brought any problems to me so far. 

Governor: I have not been informed of any concerns related to an increase in medical malpractice either.
____________________________________________________________________
3:15 PM: When can we expect details on plans to prepare for the surge? There are reports of health care workers being told to avoid speaking to the media in other states, are you doing this in Ohio?

Governor: We have a call with the mayors every weekend. We expect we will have an outline of the regions and how the buildup will proceed tomorrow. 

I have no knowledge of an issue like that in Ohio. If it would hurt a patient's treatment, I would ask they not. We have been as open and transparent as possible.
_____________________________________________________________________________
3:18 PM: Why is there a holdup on FEMA relief being approved by the president?

Governor: I think they're working on that issue and it's likely a bureaucratic problem.

Lieutenant Governor: We've been given no indication that it will not be approved.
_______________________________________________________________________
3:19 PM: What role will FEMA play in Ohio?

Governor: They're there to give us whatever help we need. We're already speaking to them about the issue. 
____________________________________________________________________________
3:20 PM: Is there potential for an extension of the stay at home order?

Lieutenant Governor: We have been in talks with businesses about that and there is a chance but that is the governor's decision. 
__________________________________________________________________________
3:21 PM: Do you think you will need to create another department due to how this crisis has been worked through?

Lieutenant Governor: We do not have an explicit answer to that question but our current team has done a great job. 

Governor: We need to build up public health nationwide. We need to ensure our medical supplies are produced in the country.
_____________________________________________________________________________
3:23 PM: How is the process of budget cuts going? When will the stay at home order be extended?

Governor: We are aiming for 20%. Some areas will be exempt. More information will come in the following days. 

I make no promises of an extension but the best science tells us we cannot let up just yet. 
________________________________________________________________________________
3:25 PM: Question period ends

My mom crashed to a light pole a few weeks ago, she was about to crash into another car but she avoided the crash by hitting the pole. It was the other person's fault for passing the stop sign and out of instinct my mom avoided hitting her. The other woman quickly left turning into a hit and run. There is witnesses at the scene and they were able to get the license plates of the car. It's from Texas and the police report came back, we got her address,name, and detailed report saying it was her fault from the police.

On Oct 25 in the morning it said it was out for delivery, so I stayed home from work *again* to receive it. Then at 11:07 am I watched a FedEx ground truck literally drive by my house. I refreshed the tracking information and saw that it was marked as delivered. What the heck? I immediately called FedEx (and checked around my neighborhood). They gave me a case ID number and said they'll ""start an investigation"". In the following six days I spoke to FedEx multiple times but they have no updates and said to contact the shipper to have it resent.

Then today my coworker told me she experienced the same exact issue. First it was ""scheduled for delivery"" but never came on Saturday and the status went into 'Pending' that night. Then today it went from 'Out for delivery' to marked as 'Delivered', but the people at the address there said nothing was ever delivered.

"We got an email letting us know that our landlord is increasing our rent by 100 dollars a month! We've lived at this place for 4 years and the rent has been increased by around the same amount every year. I'm wondering if it would be possible to negotiate with the landlord about maybe reducing the amount that our rent is being increased by. I understand that renting in Canberra is very difficult and it will be quite hard to move out and find a new place as vacancy is very low. But I just find it quite frustrating that our rent is going up every year by quite abit.  

Just wondering if anyone else has negotiated with their landlord about an increase in their rent and whether it is possible to do so? We've kept the place well and have never had issues with inspections etc."|canberra|2021|False|0

"Hi guys

I have created a website to help the CBR community create goals, stay accountable and make life a little bit more fun in these times.  


[https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/](https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/)  


I have just launched it and would really appreciate some support from this sub! If you could consider signing up, posting some goals and supporting others. Also keen on feedback and ideas of how I can spread the word.   


[Screenshot of the site](https://preview.redd.it/05q0elezndq71.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f03f4a77fffc66f7810d54f6cc54790dbb8d08c)

How does it work?  
(taken form this page- [https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/how\_it\_works.php](https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/how_it_works.php))  


  

1.  You post a goal, between 7 and 90 days long, and the clock starts counting down
2.  Other users select the ""back you up"" button to show you support
3.  You upload pictures, links to videos or text updates to show your progress 
4.  When the goal timer is up, those users who backed you up, can vote on the evidence you posted to verify you hit your target
5.  Your goal is complete!
6.  You make another goal, back some other users up and continue
7.  You will earn badges as you go and knock-off that to-do list."|canberra|2021|False|0

I'm thinking of options like buying food and donating it to a food bank, or using it for our regular shopping and donating the money we would have spent, etc.  Or should I just cut up the card? 

We're not rich, but we make enough to feed our family and don't need the extra $300-ish. We've never had or used SNAP. My understanding is that while this p-ebt program is state-funded, the federal government is reimbursing states for all of it that is used, so I'd hate for it to go to waste.

"Has anyone ever been in trouble for title jumping in New Hampshire? What happened?

I bought a car for my cousin who was supposed to move here. He was a week away from making the move before he backed out. No biggie, I got it for a steal and will make more than what I paid for it back. I really don't want to deal with the town hall or DMV. On a personal note, they don't deserve a cut in this. I've spent more than a few hours fixing a couple issues. I'll record the income at the end of the year.

The title and bill of sale are signed by the previous owner - and it is their name thats on the title. They didn't ask me to fill it out on the spot since I was going to pass it along to a relative. 

&#x200B;

What if I pass it along to someone else and was upfront about the situation? 

&#x200B;

I'm worried it could fail inspection for rust, I'm doing my best to fix what I can and cover up the rest. There is no rot though. I've had cars with more rust pass and I've seen cars with less fail, its all about where you go.  Some people are ridiculous and could make a big thing out of it. Rather than fret over it I'd like to hear others personal experiences. It's worth mentioning that I have no criminal record and I'm 30.

"I'm strongly considering moving to Huonville. There's a multitude of reasons why I should. Both of my parents were born in the Huon/Esperance region - and as much as I was raised in the suburbs of Hobart, the Huon is the only place I've ever felt like I was home.  I've come out of a marriage of family violence and another 4 years worth of that again after separation, and I feel a permanent fresh start is what my family and myself need. 
Kingston isn't too far away if I need to go further afield for something. I feel this could definitely be the place for us.

I have two sons, one is in High School and one is in late primary school.

By searching I think I've found my answer for public transport, but I have other questions.
I was hoping someone might be able to answer them for me!

What are NDIS services like there? 

I have qualifications and experience in Horticulture - are there job opportunities? 

What are the local schools like? 

Are the medical services reliable there? We just need a doctor, and a psychologist. Oh, and a vet for the feline child.

From what I have been told, there's lots of community activities for the kids (eg PCYC, sport, Pool). Is this true, and also what is available for adults? 
For context I'm in my early 40's so I won't be missing the nightlife of Hobart at all 😂

Shopping seems great - and if I really need to go elsewhere Kingston is only up the road. But I wanted to know from a local perspective.

“FFI is committed to delivering green hydrogen projects in Australia and is making good progress across our portfolio. We are continuing to work with stakeholders, including the Tasmanian government, to secure power and water supply for our plans in Tasmania,”

The sizable farms tucked away in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, the deep woods and creeks, the sprinkling of German Mennonite church, the ""big"" small towns like Frederick, Westminster and Bel Air. The classy well kept small towns like Mt. Airy, Taneytown, Thurmont, and Hampstead. The numerous nature preserves areas such as Prettyboy Reservoir Park, Catocin Mountain Park/Preserve, Liberty Reservoir Park, and Rocks State Park. This assures that the area will remain semi rural. Also relatively low COL compared to other parts of the state. Overall I think Northern Maryland is hands down the most underrated region of Maryland. It deserves more attention then it gets. It has some of the best Piedmont scenery around, a unique culture, and some quaint small towns. I think more people should check out Northern Maryland.

Ok so years ago my mother had her friend do flooring in our modular house before she died, cause the carpet was bad... But the friend did not do a good job with it, left bubbles and air pockets plus the flooring was cheap soo it tore if we tried to move furniture and stuff. Now it has holes and showing the base floor of the house. This is a problem cause I want this fixed, but neither I or my grandma can pay for this, insurance won't cover modulars, and I am in a rut of who to go to for information I need to get this going. Grandma does want to move but it's like pulling teeth with her and I do not think we will move before winter. Another issue is I am on propane and have aid with that as well, Soo I feel I am wasting more propane trying to keep my house warm then I am using it in anything else. Like i said i been trying to debate to put this in two other subreddits but i am not how much help i would get for me being in ohio.

I am a student at Rutgers University working on a research study, and I would like to know if anyone is willing to complete this survey and share it with others. 

My research study is on improving infrastructure in coastal communities to alleviate the impacts caused by frequent flooding and other natural hazards. The purpose of this survey is to help me identify key areas of concern resulting from the effects of flooding and other natural hazards. The survey has ten questions, seven of which are multiple choice and three open responses. The survey is anonymous with no benefits or risks as it does not ask for your name or other personal information. Participation is completely voluntary, and refusal to participate will result in no penalties. You may opt out of completing the survey at any time while taking it. 

I am hoping to get as many people that either reside or work in Perth Amboy specifically, but if you live or work in another coastal city or town, you are welcome to fill out this survey. Should you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for your time!

"My girlfriend and I are looking at apartments and I found two complex’s one in Landing through a complex named Shore Hill Apartments with Platinum Realty management and the one in Kinnelon through Garden communities named Kinnelon Ridge. 


We were thinking of either one of these complex’s although I haven’t applied to either yet so I don’t even know if I get approved (I make at least 60k as a therapist but have no rental history as I’ve lived at home). Also the person I talked to for the complex in kinnelon did not seem the friendliest when I asked her questions. 

 I was curious if anyone had any thoughts on these towns? I know Kinnelon is a nice town especially to raise a family I guess my main concern is my girlfriend is Peruvian and based on the demographics both these towns are pretty white and republican which isn’t an issue but I guess I’m just concerned how comfortable we feel there. I’m from the West Essex area and although these towns are more white  we’re used to being near diverse towns with a lot of different cultures so I’m sure it be an adjustment in either one of these towns given the greater area. If not these towns does anyone have suggestions for other apartments or towns?

Hello, I was writing this post to see if anyone on this group was interested, or knew of someone who would be interested in a 24/7 caregiver job for an elderly friend we are trying to get some assistance for. The gentleman is 80 years old and resides alone, in an apartment. He would have a bedroom available for anyone interested, as well as food. So, food and shelter would be covered by him. Besides this, he is willing to pay 1850$ weekly. The primary job responsibilities would be: 
-driving him to and from doctor’s appointments. 
-Grocery shopping 
-cooking meals (relatively healthy meals as He is on dialysis, so has some dietary/fluid restrictions. this is important as he enjoys foods and as long as the individual interested can cook well, we can provide general recommendations of foods. 
-laundry/folding clothes/sheets (unit in apartment) 
-coordinating with medical team (if needed) to address needs/concerns 
-assistance getting to and from the bathroom, if he needs to go later in the night. Generally, he does not, but if he does wake up at night, he tends to feel weak and would need assistance. 

To clarify further, in terms of payment, he is willing to pay $1850 a week and this can be made out as a check or cash, whichever works for you. When you run errands/grocery shopping, he will provide a card to cover the costs. Moreover, he will also have a private room for you to stay in. If interested, you will have shelter and food covered, as well 1850$ weekly.

">> **Monash father accused of incest breaches bail conditions | The Canberra Times | Canberra, ACT**

>> *Hannah Neale*
>> *28 Jun 2024 at 4:00 PM*

>> A dad, accused of raping and indecently assaulting his children, “confronted” a witness and interfered with a police investigation, a prosecutor has claimed. The 44-year-old man from Monash, who cannot be named for legal reasons, faced the ACT Magistrates Court on Friday after breaching bail conditions.  He faces 40 charges including eight counts of incest or attempted incest, 19 counts of committing an act of indecency on a young person, as well as multiple counts of committing an act of indecency in the presence of a young person. It is unclear if he has entered pleas to the charges. A police document states the alleged crimes involved seven victims including the man’s children and their friends. On Friday, a prosecutor told court more complainants had come forward to police. The lawyer applied to have the man’s bail revoked, saying he had “confronted” a witness in breach of his conditions.  They said the 44-year-old had attempted to interfere with the police investigation by contacting the person.  Legal Aid duty lawyer Lesley Jayasuriya argued against bail being revoked.  Mr Jayasuriya said he had been instructed the man didn’t know the non-contact condition extended to this particular witness.  “[He] instructs that upon receiving that update he then blocked [the witness] from Facebook” the lawyer stated.  Magistrate James Lawton allowed the man’s bail to continue, but urged him “to carry your bail conditions around with you and further comply”. Police documents allege the man raped and indecently assaulted three of his children over a period of several years with the youngest being 10. He is also accused of urging some of them to do lines of cocaine. Three of the children reported waking up to find vibrators turned on near their pillow, allegedly placed there by their father. It is also alleged the man hid cameras in the girls’; bedrooms and around the home. The documents also allege the man raped his half-sister when she was 16. The man is accused of walking around the common areas of the home naked and making sexual comments to friends of his children. The documents allege on one occasion he was walking around naked except for a McDonald’s cup covering his genitals. When another friend stayed the night, the man is accused of placing his genitals on the boy’s head while he was sleeping and taking a photo. The man also allegedly Tasered a child on the arm after saying: “Let me Taser your nuts and you can have a few lines of coke.” He is set to return to court at a later date.

"Well everyone it happened. Walmart 21st and maize. I was walking to my car with my 1yr old behind this couple who weren't wearing masks in the store and was keeping atleast a 15ft gap between myself and them. They started itching closer and closer and we're talking very loudly as they wanted to be heard saying folks that wear masks should ""Rob banks with them"" that they also ""had there thumb up there ass"" and of course the ever so used ""sheeple"". Now I'm not one to engage in an argument or conflict unless it's directly at me. So they had parked near my car and the gentleman proceeded to call me a sheeple and dumbass. Me being a chill dude I ignored until he tried to come near me and my child. Which at this point I'm ready for whatever comes next. Well as he continues on his lil rant towards me I kindly asked if he had anything else better to do with his life. Well that upset this individual and his wife. Now keep in mind I don't judge people by any means. We are all humans with our own problems, life and whatever else. But as they proceeded to get into there early 2000s Pontiac on 2 donut wheels that was 4 different colors, I could see now why they were talking like that towards me. So any way homie starts getting loud with me and I'm minding my own still walking with my child in the stroller and he starts yelling. I proceed to call him a mouth breathing child and leave it at that. Any way big slice says to me ""if you got some shit to say come over and I'll break your fuc*ing neck"" so I just laugh at him which appeared to anger him and his companion even more. While touting whatever it was I just walked off. As I park a distance from everyone else trying to get spots close to the door. Needles to say why do people think that another person isent capable of doing whatever is necessary to protect there child and themselves. I'm honestly curious in these individuals thought process of this ""untouchable"" mindset when you know nothing about this person your trying to start something with. That being said I wish everyone well with hope and love to get through this crisis. Stay strong Wichita.

"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Controversy is heating up when it comes to a new law in Arkansas you have likely heard of.

Act 372 will allow library employees to face criminal penalties for distributing books found to be harmful to children.

Executive Director of Central Arkansas Library System, Nate Coulter, said one of the lawyers for the library came to the board Thursday to explain litigation options when it comes to this new law. The board voted to allow the attorney to keep exploring litigation.

“I call it an attack on the freedom to read in the first amendment,” Coulter said in an interview Friday.

Coulter said there are two components so far, his board and library attorneys believe are unconstitutional.

One is the harmful to minors, criminalization provision.

“The idea that vilifying librarians and subjecting them to criminal penalties for something that has already been determined in one instance to be a standard that is flawed, is hard to understand frankly,” Coulter said.

Coulter pointed to a federal case in 2004 where a similar statute was found unconstitutional.

“Even though they switched words here and there, the effect is the same,” he said.

The second component is the statute that allows a city board or county quorum court to decide if a book stays in the library or needs to be moved.

We reached out to State Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Jonesboro) who sponsored the bill that is now law. He said:

“The only confusion as to the constitutionality of Act 372 seems to be in Nate Coulter’s head, as fueled by the law firm salivating over the possibility of biting into the $50,000 that the Central Arkansas Library System budgets for lawyers. Coulter campaigned against the bill, and now that it is law, he has been looking to spend taxpayer money to overturn it–including falsely claiming it applies to materials the Attorney General himself made clear the law doesn’t cover. I wonder whether the citizens of central Arkansas, who pay amongst the highest library taxes in the state, know that the head of their library system treats their hard-earned money as a slush fund to pursue his personal progressive crusade.”

In response to the statement, Coulter said,

“When you cannot respond on the merits or the substance of what we are talking about, then I guess you resort to attack me personally,” Coulter said. “This is not about me. It is not about Dan Sullivan. It is about the law.”

Coulter added that the library is looking for pro bono representation. As of now, the law is set to go into effect August 1. Coulter said they expect a lawsuit to be filed before then."|arkansas|2023|False|0

"# Post your ""Moving to Montana"" (MtM) questions here.

A few *guidelines* to spurring productive conversations about MtM:

1. **Be Specific:** Asking ""what towns in Montana have good after-school daycare programs?"" will get you a lot farther than ""what town should I move to?""
2. **Do your homework:** If a question can be answered with a google search ... do the google search. Heck, try [searching previous threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/search/?q=Move%20to%20montana) here.
3. **Take the wins where you can:** Your question got downvoted, but also generated some informative responses. Often that's the best you can hope for around here. Take the **W** and feel good about it. Don't take personal offense to fake internet points or comments. But please do report abuse. We don't want abuse here.
4. **Seriously, don't ask us what town to move to:** Unless you're asking something specific and local-knowledge-based like, ""I have job offers in Ryegate and Forsyth, which one has the most active interpretive dance theater scene""?
5. **Be sensitive to Montanan's concerns:** Seriously, don't boast about how much cheaper land is here. It isn't cheap to people earning Montana wages. That kind of thing. 
6. **Leave the politics out of it:** If you're moving here to *get away* from something, you're just bringing that baggage along with you. You don't know Montana politics yet, and Reddit doesn't accurately reflect Montana politics anyway; so just leave that part out of it. No, we don't care that Gavin Abbot was going to take away your abortion gun. Leave those issues behind when asking Montanans questions. See r/Montana Rule #1
7. **If you insist on asking us where to move:** you are hereby *legally obliged* to move to whatever town gets the most upvotes. Enjoy Scobey.

**to** r/Montana **regulars**: if they're here rather than out there on the page, they're abiding by our rules. Let's rein in the abuse and give them some legitimate feedback.

"I know this has already been covered to some extent but I wanted to add another option to the table for returning control of the internet back to consumers. Arkansas is at a severe competitive disadvantage where quality internet access is concerned, with a sizable amount of our residents having few or no options for quality, affordable internet access. You either take the slow, expensive single option you have, or you go without. 

You can and should call your congressman and both of our senators, and remind them that they are supposed to work for us, not AT&T, Cox, Windstream, Verizon, etc. You’ll probably receive a canned response stating something along the lines of “It’s not currently a legislative issue” or “I oppose net neutrality” just like the responses I received. 

Then, Remember who your representatives really support next election. 

But, here is the next thing you should do: if you are one of the many Arkansans who receive power from a Cooperative, you are a member and therefore “owner/shareholder” of that Cooperative. Call your board members and tell them you want them to become ISP’s. Some of the cooperatives are already going down this path (Ouchita, Ozark’s, and North Arkansas) but many of them are hesitant because of the cost and concerns about the support of their customers. 

Fiber to the home throughout the state would be extremely advantageous for us economically and would help pave the way to place broadband back in the hands of consumers. 

Edit: I directed this post to the people in the state I call Home but I do think this message needs to go beyond us. There are over 900 member owned power utilities in the United States. All of them already have at least part of the infrastructure in place to make this happen. If members of those utilities pressured their boards and executives to invest in fiber to the premises and large scale data infrastructure and then financially supported those investments (by becoming subscribers), it could completely reshape the way broadband service works in this country.  If the fed refuses to break up the bell system (which is desperately needed, again) we can do it for them. "|arkansas|2017|False|0

"Another redditor recently posted about one of the ""coyote friends"" they saw.

I commented ""they eat our pets"", and that comment very quickly was down voted into oblivion. Someone else told me that if your pet gets eaten by a coyote, you musn't have taken very good care of your pet.

I wanted to make this post to bring a simple fact to your attention: the coyotes are naturally aggressive to small animals, and they have been getting increasingly brazen about targeting our loved ones. I would go as far as to say that small children are not safe at dusk.

Here is the story:

My aunt was walking her Chihuahua in the park, with people, small children, and dogs around. A coyote ran through the park, took her dog in its mouth, and ran off whilst ripping the leash out of her hand.

Some locals found half of him in the wash.

One week later on the day, she was having some family in the park to have a memorial service for her fallen friend. Interrupting her mid speech, a coyote tears through the park with a Pomeranian locked in its jaws.

We chased, threw sticks and rocks. My father caught up to it, kicked it in the rear leg, and it dropped the dog.

The dog had severe neck injuries and was bleeding out. It was taken to a hospital, where it made a partial recovery. We later found out that the Pomeranian was taken from someone's back yard, three blocks away.

I also have a small to mid sized dog, and I feel bad that she can't play in the back yard because it simply isn't safe. The coyotes do not care about people, and they do not care about walls or fences. These two instances are just the two that I have witnessed, several other neighbors have lost their pets as reported on the Nextdoor forums.

Beware the coyotes, and keep your pets in doors. Go out with them when needed, keep them under supervision.

Nobody did anything wrong, nobody was negligent. The coyote are varmints who eat our pets.

**EDIT:** the comments are right. Perhaps a better way to have said this is:

Coyotes are wild animals. Just because they look cute does not mean they are friendly. Don't let them eat your newborn, because they have a propensity."|phoenix|2022|False|0

"Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses. My team and I learned a lot about your situation and we hope any final product we develop can be used to assist you. Currently, we are beginning work on our version of a hydroponics system. If our project reaches maturity before the end of our time together as a team, we will reach out to a few specific locations. Unfortunately, considering the circumstances that this project is only one semester long, I don’t realistically see us reaching this point.


Hi everyone! I'm a student at Purdue University working on a project about food scarcity. I've heard from a number of sources that imported food in Alaska can sometimes be prohibitively expensive. My team is exploring the possibility of supplementing the availability of vegetables with hydroponics systems. For those who don't know, hydroponics systems are used to grow vegetables without soil in racks that can be stacked vertically to optimize space. They are efficient, low-budget, and can save money over time by reducing the need for buying or importing vegetables. 

So my question is, would you be interested in a small, low-cost hydroponics system in your home to supplement vegetables purchased at the store? Or a large hydroponics system for your town to increase the availability of vegetables in the community? Or is this a non-issue that doesn't need to be addressed?

"I recently got a job offer to work in Denali for a seasonal position. I've been exploring options to get up there (I would be coming from northern Nevada), either by ferry or by driving.

Apparently, the ferry doesn't get its official summer schedule (starting May or thereabouts) until sometime in the next few weeks, though I am not sure if I misunderstood. I was planning to leave from Bellingham to Whittier, which seems quite pricey according to the example fare.

I drive a 2018 Honda Civic, and ideally, I'd like my car with me. I was leaning more toward taking the drive up instead, as it seems more cost-effective.

"The title is somewhat self-explanatory. I'm a 21 year old student from Chicago, Illinois, and I'm considering working next summer in the fishing industry, either as a greenhorn or in a processing plant. Only problem? All I've got to go by are anecdotes. I know it's brutal, dirty, often dangerous work, but is what people say about the money that's there true? I've been interested in trying it for a while, and I'm thinking this year's going to be the one I do it. I don't have any experience with the fishing industry (being from Chicago and all), but I'm interested in learning, I'm not afraid of 16 hour days of hard work (spent a year in the construction industry before going to school), I can cook fairly well, I don't get seasick, and I'm a fast learner. Most of all though, I've got nothing to lose and nothing keeping me here. Spending a summer working in Alaska would help me pay for college and take some steps towards financial independence and making something of myself. 

Long story short, this year has not been too kind to me. I had a very serious long term relationship end, my relationship with my parents (whom I'm still financially dependent on) has been taking a turn for the worst, and my financial situation has changed to the point where if I have to take out loans I'm going to spend years paying for them on a teacher's salary. I'm sick of being financially dependent on my parents, terrified of going into debt, afraid I'll be 30 and still living at home, and sick of being almost 22 and having nothing to show for it, while my friends are all settling down and moving on with their lives. Having said that, I'm not going to sit around feeling sorry for myself, and trying to find work up here is my plan for improving my lot. I know there's no way to really prepare yourself for what you're getting into, but the ability to  (hopefully) make several thousand dollars over the course of a summer would literally be a life changing opportunity to me. 

What I'm really wondering is how to actually get my foot in the door as a greenhorn? I've heard working as a processor sucks but if it means getting some experience I'm willing to hold my nose and power through a few months. I've heard that you typically need to know someone in order to get a job on a boat. Should I start as a processor, try to find something online, or should I take a leap of faith and actually start hitting the pavement up in Alaska? 

Any insights would be much appreciated."|Alaska|2019|True|0
"So as the title says, I'm looking for help with a project of mine. I'm creating a sci-fi series with nations made up of various geographical regions across Earth. The one I'm working on now is called Vesperia, it was formed by the various nations of the Arctic Circle, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia.

Today around noon I was driving back to Cincinnati on 75 North. Just before the (shut down?) rest area the car in front of me started billowing smoke. I pulled over to make sure they were all good, no fire, etc.

"Trying to schedule an appointment for my child with a therapist at KU Med is a 2 month wait. Every other place I've tried is the same unless its an 'emergency', which is classified as self harm or thoughts of suicide. The problem is that sometimes its not one of those things but you can't wait 2 months. So you have to schedule it regularly once a month or more, whether they need it or not. But even that doesn't work with KU Med because its a 2 month wait but the therapists don't take appointments more than 3 months out. It's absolutely maddening. 

I was told by one of the dozens of therapists offices I called that the reason for this is a shortage of therapists. Why is that? Is the money not good? Training difficult? What else, anyone know?"|KansasCity|2023|False|0

"I will be visiting Vegas at the end of October with my wife and 3 kids (ages 12, 10, and 8). Back in college I used to go to Vegas at least 2-3 times per year, mostly for college tennis tournaments. The last time I was there was 4 years ago for a conference, and went with just my wife. We saw O and Love and really enjoyed both of them. 

My questions are 1) any other shows we should consider with kids that age?  I think we are leaning more towards Cirque de Soleil type shows rather than comedy or magic type shows. I wouldn’t mind seeing O again and I’m sure my kids would also like it, but for you veterans of Vegas shows, are there other better shows I should consider?

My second question is about the best way to purchase tickets. I know you can go online and buy them directly from the show’s website, but how often can you get discount tickets for those kind of shows?  The other slight complication is that my daughter will be playing in a soccer tournament, so some days the games may be scheduled earlier and we could see a show that night but we won’t know that until the day or two before, depending on how her team does. How likely am I to be able to get 5 tickets together the same day or day before the show?  The day we arrive should be the day before her tournament starts, so we’ll probably just buy tickets for a show that night in advance to make sure we get at least one show. 

Thanks for the help. I’m sure you tire of seeing here types of questions but I really appreciate it and don’t know anyone who lives there from whom I cold get advice. I also tried searching and couldn’t find answers to these questions. I did see the link to the 37 best shows for kids, but was hoping for some personal thoughts from people who have seen them and maybe have kids my kids’ ages."|LasVegas|2019|False|0

She says she moved somewhere in the Greenwood school district. Do I have to live in the Greenwood school district if I want joint custody?

"Hello... I am originally from Massachusetts and live in NJ now. I love studying fandom statistics.. its a hobby of mine.

But to the point, I was recently in Rhode Island and saw quite a few Yankees hats (Westerly). I did a little bit of research and I found out that because of the large Italian American population in Rhode Island, in the 1960s-1970s, the New York Yankees fandom grew to almost 40% of the state's population. Obviously since then, its definitely retreated by quite a bit. However, I would say that about 15% of Rhode Islanders are Yankees fans now.. per my observation. Significantly less in towns like Middleton and Newport, but higher in Johnston and Westerly. In Westerly it was like 25% of all hats were Yankees hats.

"Hello everyone! 

My husband and I are looking to move to Mississippi. His work is remote and my work isn’t location dependent. We were planning on going on an long road trip and staying in potential towns to get a feel for what they’re like and I was hoping someone would be able to help us out making our short list! We both love (and are from) the south and really love a slow pace of life! 

Our criteria for a town would be: 

- Not too small, but not too big. In our minds this would be around 15-30 thousand residents. It could be bigger or smaller, as long as the traffic was close to non existent and it had decent amenities.
- Decent amenities. My husband and I are in our early 30’s, we don’t go out to restaurants/bars/nightlife establishments of any sort and don’t mind if a town doesn’t have them. Our type of amenities would be a decent selection of grocery stores (so we wouldn’t be stuck paying a mark up at the one grocery store in town), gyms (ideally some more speciality gym activities such as yoga, Pilates, kickboxing, martial arts, etc.), nail salons, churches, a good home improvement store, a Walmart supercenter is convenient too just because they have so many things.
- A good hospital and decent everyday doctors (GP, dentist, common specialists, etc.) so that we wouldn’t have to drive to a city every time we needed to go to the doctor.
- Low crime. The safer the better! 
- Lots of nature and greenery/ green spaces and parks would be nice. Clean air.
- A nice downtown or Main Street area where amenities are closer together to avoid a lot of sprawl would be great. 
- Ideally located around 1-1.5 hours outside of a city. What city it’s outside of doesn’t matter, but just being at least an hours driving distance away is necessary.
- An affordable town. We’re moving because we’ve been priced out of comfortably living in our area and would really like to be able to be comfortable. Affordable cost of living and real estate would be important. 

That’s about it for criteria! If you’re able to help in sharing some towns thank you so much! Have a blessed day!"|Mississippi|2021|False|0

She then informed me that sparkling was only 2 syllables and I debated her on it for 2 moments of thought, then realised im just too southern for my own good, and continued to stand on sparkling as a better word through pure stubborn generarional principle.

"Hey guys, just moved here about a month or so ago. I love karaoke. Love it. I can sing decent and it's all I did when I was stationed in Japan (Air Force). Looking online I see quite a few dive bars and an all-around different experience than what I'm used to. 

Which is totally fine, and I can have fun anywhere.

That being said, does anyone have some first-hand experience with the local karaoke bars, or any recommendations for us to try our luck at tonight? We're mid-20's so maybe not looking for an old Texas bar where they only play country songs. Cheers!"|Omaha|2017|False|0
"I play D&D with a group and we meet up at a house near where Bohemian Cafe used to be.  I usually bring a 6pk of cheap tallboys and chips, but I wanna bring a little more this week.

"I recently moved to Omaha and needed to get my out of state vehicle inspected and registered in NE. Went through the typical experience that we've all had at DMVs, thoroughly unpleasant. 

My question is about the surcharges applied to customers who use credit or debit cards. I had to pay a $10 fee for the inspection, and a $2.95 surcharge was applied for using my debit card. Then I paid $135 for registration and a $7.95 surcharge was applied. This seems exorbitant, and from my experience in PA and NJ, unlawful. I looked into the NE code (http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=81-118.01), and it seems to indicate that businesses, particularly state agencies like the Douglas County Treasurer, can impose a surcharge or convenience fee, but it cannot ""exceed the surcharge or convenience fee imposed by the credit card or charge card companies or third-party merchant banks"", up to 4%. My credit and debit card company has a 2% fee. This would mean a $.20 and $2.70 fee respectively. 

Can anyone explain what's going on here?"|Omaha|2017|False|0
"It's tricky here (Gallatin Valley) with a short season and temperamental climate, but using biodegradable plastic mulch and starting seeds of shorter growing season varieties and transplanting makes it possible. This was one day of work, about 30-40 bins that were hand harvested. It took a total of 9 days.There were 6 miles of pumpkins/squash this year, all sold wholesale to local distributors within 30 miles. 

This year was about a 50/50 mix between different types of squash/wartys/colorful varieties and small (2 lb) to 40 or 50 lb orange and white pumpkins.

I had selected yellow, pink, striped, green, tan, tall/skinny, short/flat. It was so much fun picking varieties. The starting talley was 25k seeds. I think the total picked was around 17k lbs. 

This is the alfalfa/sweet corn. The pumpkin field was on the other side of the sweet corn. I didn't get as many pics as I would have liked, this was on my 'vacation' time from work and usually a dark to dark job for me, since there was a time crunch on my availability, plus getting crops in is always a big push.  

Not my ranch or crops, ranch belongs to my grandmother, my dad lives there and manages, and this will all go to my brother and his family at some point. I just help with harvests and wanted to share.

Over the years we have collected pallets from around town, and bins from grocery stores. The pallets are moved with a tractor/skid steer. They are stored in a large building until sold, then loaded onto a flatbed trailer and delivered."|Montana|2023|False|0

"The area I usually park at is taken by Netflix for some production for 24 hours during 12/1. So I was looking at other streets to park at in my neighborhood (Boston Chinatown). So street cleaning is supposed to end 11/30 I think for daytime cleaning but the street I’m prospecting has a sign that says 2am-7am daily (Boston website has 12:01-7am daily). The city of Boston website states: “If you don’t see any months on a posted street sweeping sign, parking restrictions are in place year-round.” But the sign on the street doesn’t have any months, so safe to assume it’s year round nighttime street cleaning for these streets?

Any help is appreciated to clarify as I am quite puzzled.

A friend of mine and I have been meeting another friend from Greenville once a month in Anderson to eat dinner. We’ve been to a lot of different restaurants and we’re having trouble deciding on where to go next. Raines on Main looks good but the website seems to indicate the tables are huge (so would be eating with strangers) and Earle St Kitchen and Bar is in the running but not sure if the area is safe. Can any Andersonians or others that have eaten at either of these two places please share your thoughts? |SouthCarolina|2024|False|0
Staying at a SC resort, fairly nice resort overall  really but in our room we found what I guess is a palmetto bug, which is basically a cockroach from what I've googled. Back in Indiana, cockroaches are cause for general concern and indicates you need some pest control/finding the source fairly soon. But resort didnt seem concerned, they said its fairly normal in SC to have them. So I guess for SC residents, is the resort downplaying it or is this just a fairly normal thing that you live with?

Hey y’all. Last night I was coming home from work and a cop chilling in my neighborhood and pulled me over for “running a stop sign” that I absolutely stopped at. I live off Fairview and he said they’d be having issues with people speeding through the neighborhood which makes sense I guess but the ticket he gave me was for 230 dollars!? He also made a big deal out of not putting the points on my license. Felt really bizarre. Anybody have advice or insight? |SouthCarolina|2024|False|0

"My husband has a salaried position. He already consistently works at least 50 hours a week Monday- Friday. Work got extra busy so they TOLD him that they needed him to work Saturday too. Then when he asked what the pay situation is, they said they will pay him by the hour but $10 less per hour than he would make during the week because “it shouldn’t be as busy on Saturday as it is during the week.” And it was *expected* that he would work Saturday. And it was busy on Saturday on top of it all.

Hi! In need to replace two HVAC units on my primary residence, and am confused if 14 seer is suffice, or it’s really worth upgrading to 15 Seer. Furthermore, some of the companies have reccomended 2-stage instead of single stage. And a couple companies sell the high end Bosch “fully variable” HVAC.  Anyone have this? Every salesperson that comes out has a completely different opinion. One guy said 14 seer is better for a rental (which this isn’t), but not for your primary residence. Not sure who to trust.

"Hi everyone, 

I’ve just been offered a job in Tassie on the NW Coast, I’m super excited but have one small dilemma, my cat. I’m currently living in Outback QLD and I’m trying to think of the best way to bring her down. She is quite an anxious girl so wanting to make sure I’m choosing the least stressful way for her. Here are the options I’ve come up with so far,

1) drive her to Brisbane, she’ll have to stay in boarding for a few days and then fly down to either Launceston or Devonport. 

2) Drive her down with me to Melbourne and use pawmobile to fly her over but she will probably have to board overnight while I catch the spirit over with my car. 

She hasn’t spent much time in the car so not sure how that will go. 

I’ve heard really bad things about pets going over on spirit of Tasmania so I’m a bit reluctant to do that. 

Has anyone moved their pets over recently and have a different option for me, or any advice in general. 

Much appreciated! "|tasmania|2024|False|0

x-posted /r/OKC

See my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/okc/comments/3k4q49/oklahoma_city_we_desperately_need_your_help/)

Last September, while my sister and I were stopped at a Conoco station in Oklahoma City, my sister's severe macaw Amelia escaped from her carrier and flew out of our car. We posted here and several kind redditors went to look for her but she was not found.

She has been looking for Amelia ever since: posting on craigslist, watching ads, bird forums, everything she can think of. All vets, pet stores, etc. in the area have received flyers with a photo of Amelia. 

Last night there was an ad posted on craigslist. The poster was from McAlester, OK and is offering to sell a severe macaw. Before my sister could contact the poster, the ad was taken down. The bird shown in the photo bears a striking resemblance to Amelia. All birds who are bred in captivity must wear a band around their leg with a unique identifying number. 

I know this is a long shot, but if you posted that craigslist ad, we would like very much to compare band numbers. We won't ask any questions and we will pay a reward for Amelia if it is her and she is returned to us. If you know anyone who is trying to sell a severe macaw (she is green with red and blue on her wings and white around her eyes with brownish feathers on her forehead and underneath her beak) that they haven't had for very long, will you please encourage them to PM me? 

Thank you to everyone who saw our original post and went to look for her. I know McAlester is quite a ways from OKC, but I have seen amazing things happen due to the power of reddit and I am hoping that someone who sees this can help make a miracle happen here.

Thank you. "|Oklahoma|2016|False|0

"This is a heads-up post, I am working with MeterUp to solve my particular issue.

I parked in the PPA lot at 8th and Chestnut yesterday, the signs and the kiosk digital display listed $15/day flat rate for weekend parking.  The machine couldn't read my credit card, so I paid with MeterUp.  The charge for the same parking lot and the same ""flat rate"" on the app was $20.40.  

I called MeterUp and asked them if there should be a difference in pricing on the app vs the credit card kiosk, and they said no, but that the city sets the app prices.  

What this comes down to, is that the city charged an extra $5.40 for using the app (error or ?).  If you have to drive and park in a metered spot and use MeterUp, just make sure you are paying the same price the kiosk would charge you for cash or card."|Philadelphia|2023|False|0

"Hi! I’m not sure if this is the right place to post and apologies if not but I’m not sure if the laws would differ in countries. 

I have recently had a role change at my job and a new contract issued. I’m remaining a full time employee and the only change is that I’ll be doing a 9 day fortnight and having 1 day a week off every fortnight but making up for that day off by working more hours during the week.

My old contract stated I was to work “a minimum of 38 hours with additional hours where required to meet the demands of the job”

In this new contract the 38 hours has been changed to 40 and even though I work longer hours than I already should, I’m more curious as to why they would even change it to 38 and if there’s a valid reason or if it’s just my bosses being wankers.

My housemate has also said she believes legally they can’t write more than 38 on a full time employee contract. Can anyone help me out with any advice on this?

"Hi r/Brisbane,

I'm in desperate need of a cuddle companion, and have a cat sized hole in my life. 

My problem is that despite adoring the cat I had growing up, I was very much allergic so now I'm looking into the hypoallergenic-ish cats (no cat is truly hypoallergenic). This brought me to the breed Russian Blue or just Russian [(apparently they come in white and black as well).](http://russiancatcouncilofaustraliaincorporated.com/gallery.html)

 I'm wanting to meet a Russian cat though before contacting a breeder because I don't want to waste anyone's time. Also [this site](http://russiancatcouncilofaustraliaincorporated.com/gallery.html) listed only one breeder in QLD, so I'd probably road trip down to NSW should a breeder have a kitten available.

My problem is that I have no idea how to find someone who might have this breed of cat to then ask them if they'd be willing to let me meet their cat. My next great idea is putting up flyers in a vet waiting room, ""please let me meet your cat;"" I'm not sure if that's a terrible idea. 


If anyone has any advice whatsoever, on hypoallergenic-ish cats, meeting a cat or anything I haven't thought of, I'd very much appreciate it.

"Hoping there are some opinions here, or someone who has experienced similar.

Just finished up at a rental place, during the rental period one copy of a front door key got bent (which I then threw out). 

The rental agency are saying since I can't return the exact same keys as I was provided, the lock has to be replaced and charged to me.

I feel like I should be charged to replace the key, but not the lock. The argument that since I can't prove the key was broken and disposed of is irrelevant - any renter could theoretically makes 100s of copies of the house keys and hold onto them. Either they have to replace all the locks after any renter leaves, or it's just assumed the renter hasn't done this.

"I am hoping someone here can give me some advice. I am nearing the end of the recruitment process for a couple of APS positions, both requiring security clearance, NV1 or NV2.

I am concerned about criminal associates. My sister’s boyfriend has just gotten out of jail on bail. His case is fairly serious and I have suspicions he is connected to organized crime, mostly because my sister has sort of been on the periphery of that for years and I am sure she is a “known associate”. She has also worked in the sex industry, not as a sex worker, but as a manager for many years. She’s had substance abuse problems and had a couple of DUI’s, but nothing else. She’s been to rehab and has been clean for a while and has just gotten out of the industry she’s been in.

She and I are very, very different. I went to law school, honours and academic excellence scholarships, and have always been on the straight and narrow. I tried weed and ecstasy as a teen, but nothing since. I barely even drink. I don’t associate with “criminals”, except through working in criminal law.

My sister and I aren’t especially close. We don’t share intimate details of our lives with each other. I lived very far from her for the last 8 years and consequently only saw her a couple of times. Now I live closer and see her about once a month. 

She wants me to meet her boyfriend. I am not sure whether to meet him while I am going through this process.

"Quick explanation: when I was a teen I always wanted to do the crafts and classes (woodworking, sewing, painting, etc) at my school and camps but my parents wouldn’t let me. Now as an adult I have the money to do it myself! Unfortunately, there’s zero opportunities once you’re an adult.

What I was looking for was some sort of program where you learn and experience different crafts and activities as an adult. It does not have to be specifically in the summer or at a camp, but just a similar experience where you can try new things through a program. Is there anything like that in the Indianapolis area, or even in the surrounded cities (Carmel, Greenwood, etc)?"|Indianapolis|2023|False|0

"Hey all, 

Those of you who've seen me around before know that I'm a real estate agent, and today I'm here to share some knowledge. I believe everybody can benefit from education on our local housing market. I'll be sharing some key numbers from the past 30 days, the previous 30-60 days (one month ago), and the same time period last year (395-365 days ago). Then, I'll share my interpretations of the information, and any other relevant trends that I am seeing personally. 

The last time I posted this, I said that I would post this data monthly. However, because our board of realtors released a ~~completely broken~~ multiple listing service with reduced functionality at the new year, this will be posted on an ""as I have time for it"" basis. What used to take me 30 minutes now takes me 3 hours at least. 

I'm going to share the median and average sales prices, the median and average days on market (DOM), the number of new listings, and the total number of sales. Basically, how much there is for sale, how fast it's selling, and how much it's selling for. I've also included months of supply in the first month, which is a general indicator of market balance. Six months is generally called a balanced market, while low supply favors sellers and high supply favors buyers. 

How I got these numbers: 

This data is intended to represent the area that I would call ""the greater Indy area."" This is anything about 16.5 miles from the north split downtown (to include Indy and the first set of cities outside of 465), plus Noblesville, Westfield, and Whitestown. While it isn't a perfect picture, I think it does a solid job of capturing Indy's housing market. The data comes straight from the multiple listing service (the MLS). I can provide the raw data for anybody who is interested. These numbers will probably be different from the numbers you see posted on social media. Those numbers frequently include as far south as Trafalgar and as far north as Marion (which I hardly consider greater Indy). This is focused on Indianapolis and the edges of the donut counties. 

**This Month's Data**

* Average Sale Price: $313k
* Median Sale Price: $275k
* Average DOM: 52
* Median DOM: 32
* New listings: 1,531
* Number of sales: 1,273
* Supply of homes: 32 days

**Last Month's Data**

* Average Sale Price: $307k
* Median Sale Price: $271k
* Average DOM: 45
* Median DOM: 26
* New listings: 1,299
* Number of sales: 928

**This Month Last Year's Data**

* Average Price: $299k
* Median Price: $260k
* Average DOM: 23
* Median DOM: 5
* New listings: 1,696
* Number of sales: 1,576

**My Interpretation**

You've probably heard that the housing market has slowed down from the height of the craziness that was late 2019 through summer of 2022, and you've heard correctly. 

For the first time since 2018, we experienced a true seasonal slowdown over the winter months. The growth in number of new listings (up 18%) and number of sales (up 37%) from last month to this month reflects that. Homes that sat on the market over the winter have finally started to sell as people come out of the funk that is the holidays. One month later – the ""typical"" length of time it takes to go from an accepted offer on a home to closing on the home – we see that behavior reflected in the data. 

Supply of homes is still low, according to the data. However, there's an important caveat here. Supply of homes is based on the following calculation: `(Number of active listings)/(Number of sales in the past year/365)`

Essentially, this gives us the number of days that it will take for all homes active on the market to be sold. This typically works, but given the shift we've seen in the market, I don't believe this is accurate. Since this data includes pre-slowdown sales rates, I think the true value is closer to three or four months, with six months being the accepted value for a perfectly balanced market. 

We can see that home prices are still up from this time last year, though the time of multiple offers and one weekend to see homes is gone. We're entering a balanced market, which is good for both buyers and sellers. 

The [current interest rate](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms) on 30 year fixed-rate mortgages is 6.5%, which historically is in the realm of ""not ideal, but also not that bad."" [Historical overall average since 1972](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/docs/historicalweeklydata.xls), when Freddie Mac started tracking it, is 7.69%. The highest it got (October of last year) was 7.4%. High rates are going to keep some buyers locked out of the housing market, which reflects the general trend of ""slowdown"" – a low number of buyers and a low number of homes for sale. 

**What this means for buyers and sellers:**

As I alluded to above, we're entering a truly balanced market. Depending on what the Fed does with interest rates (and predicting that is way above my pay grade), we could see shifts in either direction. Higher interest rates will keep things slow for a while, while lower interest rates will drive some interest and get some buyers back into the market. If interest rates get down to around 6% by May, I expect a busy summer in the real estate market. Otherwise, things will probably stay where they are. 

If you're a buyer who can afford a mortgage – and you never truly know what you can afford if you don't talk to someone – it's a good time to enter the market. You can get important repairs paid for, and you have room to negotiate. Obviously this varies from neighborhood to neighborhood and house to house, but this is the general trend. 

This is the kind of market where the maxim ""love the house, live with the mortgage"" applies. If you can handle the down payment and monthly payments for a few years before refinancing when the time is right, it's not a bad idea to make your big housing move. 

From the perspective of a potential seller, it's also not a bad time if you need to move. Homes in good condition are getting solid offers at or near full price, and that money will easily help you buy your next home. Sale contingencies are getting accepted (""I have to sell my house before I buy this one""), and waived inspections are a thing of the past. 

Let me know what you think in the comments! I'm more than happy to answer any questions, and let me know what you think about my interpretations of the market. I am just one agent offering his interpretation of the data. Other people could see the same data and offer different perspectives."|Indianapolis|2023|False|0

I went in line to get beers( at the booth setup inside the Iroquois amphitheatre) just before heading into Jack o lantern spectacular at Iroquois park and you and your friends were were just ahead of me.  Eventually, you turned around and asked me what kind of beer I was getting (2 Coors because one of my friends asked for a coors and I'm not very creative) and you said you didn't know what you were gonna order yet but that IPA stood for ""I'm a Pussy Ass"".   Your way with words and friendliness made the time waiting in line feel like nothing and it was super refreshing.

I was wearing a blue long sleeve and khaki pants with light brown hair and you were blond wearing blue jeans and maybe flannel ( I wanna say you were in like a 90s Nirvana-type look)  I had mentioned that I live out by the zoo which was a coincidence since the couple you came with ( the brunette and the guy with the long dark hair) actually have a house in that same area of town!  You said you were from the south side of Louisville but  it's all Greek to me since I got lost trying to park at Iroquois so what do I know... 

You guys got your drinks and stood off the side for minute and I was up to order so I thought maybe that was the last of the conversation but before I could finish ordering you tapped me on the shoulder and told me to have a fun time checking out the pumpkins and I asked you what your name was.  You said your name was Erica.  And that, of course, is where I could have and probably should have asked to swap numbers but I foolishly didn't and it's been bothering me ever since.

"Hey everyone!

I'm a experienced international traveler and I'll be doing a East Coast roadtrip and leaving Wichita on the 28th! 

Details:

Heading East I'll be planning on stopping at: Kansas City, Columbia, St Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, NYC, New Haven, Hartford, Providence, Boston, Manchester, Vermont, Montreal, & Syracuse.

Then on the return West stopping at: Washington DC, Richmond, Louisville, Nashville, Memphis, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, and finally Los Angeles!

I'm planning on this being a 14ish day long trip depending on how everything is going and how much we like certain cities. On the way out to the East Coast I plan on driving only 7-10hrs a day, so a casual pace to enjoy the trip.

Some cities listed above will be short stop offs, others I plan on spending more time at (NYC, DC, Boston, etc) but I'm open to spending more time in certain places.

Sleep in a hotel/airbnb/hostel, if you want to camp I'm down, I really enjoy the outdoors so definitely down for some scenic detours. I'm open with finances and don't mind eating out every night trying out the local restaurants, if you want to save money and eat by other means or make your own food that's cool. If money is an issue for you: gas & campsites/hotel costs can be negotiated. I'm very open to detours or even going further into Canada.

"I am currently in the Brightwood area near 25th and Sherman and have always wanted to help at a shelter but never really knew how to start but never really went beyond the thought either.  Having struggled with addiction and homelessness before and having just recently lost my girlfriend of 3 years to an overdose has made me really want to help those in need.  She never really had a lot herself having struggled with addiction and homelessness(both before me and with me) for a big portion of her life but always found a way to help those who asked, even if she only had a dollar, she would give it no questions asked and only wanted to make others laugh and smile, even though she was hurting inside.

I feel like a good way to honor her would be to help those who are in a bad spot by volunteering.  I do have a day job but would be open to volunteering on weekends or after work if I can.  Plus, anything to keep my mind occupied to help with the pain and guilt I feel from my loss would help.  

If anyone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you."|Indianapolis|2022|False|0

"Here's how to register to vote in Kansas. These instructions work nationally so they can be shared with out of state friends or family and use non-partisan information.

Please share the info with anyone who might want to register, but hasn't had the chance, time, or info to do so yet.

**Basically: Find your state **[**here**](https://vote.gov/)** and use your state's online voter registration tool to register.** If your state is one of ten that does not currently allow online registration, this website will tell you and will tell you how to complete your registration - it's usually printing/filling out a form and mailing it in.

OR, you can [register to vote in person](https://www.usa.gov/election-office).

**FAQ:**

**Q: Am I already registered to vote? Am I eligible to vote? Do I need an ID to vote? When is my next election?**

Answers [here.](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/sviddomestic.htm)

**Q: If I'm 17, can I register to vote today?**

Yes, in a number of states! If you proceed through to your state's online voting portal, which can be found [here](https://vote.gov/), it'll tell you whether you're good to go.

**Q: I'll be moving to college soon. Where should I register to vote?**

Either place - your choice. If you register to vote at school, you'll need to register or re-register with the state your school's in. If you decide to keep your home address as your voting address, you can head home to vote or vote by absentee ballot (info below on how to request & return one).

**Q: What if I need to change my voter registration?**

Find your state [here](https://vote.gov/) and follow the instructions. If you have any further questions call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm).

**Q: Can I register to vote on election day?**

If your state is purple on [this map](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx), yes. So, your friend who forgot to register can still come with you and get it done.

**Q: What if my state doesn't have same-day registration?**

Then your state likely has a registration deadline of about 30 days. That means it has to be **in their hands** by 30 days before election day.

If you're not registering online, I'd walk it to their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them, or mail it if you're doing it very early so you can be sure it arrived.

But don't depend on the mail within ...6 weeks before an election. It's just too dicey.

**Q: Do I need to keep that voter registration card they'll mail me?**

It's useful for your reference & knowing your polling place, but it is not *required* for voting. 

**Q: Can I use a pen with pink/green/orange etc. ink on these forms/on my ballot?**

It's the kind of thing you don't think of, until you do. They only allow the most conservative of colors and inks, so keep it simple: blue or black ball point pen.

If you're entering most of the info on the computer and then printing it out, your printer's default black ink is also fine.

**Q: Can I get an absentee ballot?**

*Make sure you're registered to vote first.* Then, [this page](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/VoterInformation.htm) will tell you your state's requirements, and how to request an absentee ballot.

If you vote absentee, unless you're mailing it in *very early* (over six weeks before the election), drop it off at their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them so you can be sure it arrived.

You can do that any day before the election.

**Q: If I have a felony on my record, can I vote?**

Check [here](https://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote)! Often, yes.

**Q: I'm forgetful. Is there a way I can be sent reminders?**

Yes! [Here](https://iamavoter.com).

**Q: But, do the midterms matter in my state? My state's firmly Dem/Rep.**

They sure do. While your state may not be competitive in a presidential election, your *district* may be competitive for the House of Representatives and your Senator may be. Plus, governor, state reps, etc. 

There are purple spots in blue and red states - you may be in one, and your vote could swing a number of outcomes.

**Q: Where's competitive this year?**

There are particularly competitive races in more than half the states - either [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings), [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings), or [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings). 

The list: New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Texas, Virginia, Washington, California, Colorado, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Jersey, Maryland, Indiana, and Rhode Island.

If you live in any of these states, there's a lot of competition for your vote this year and it's a great chance to get your voice heard.

**Q: If my state isn't on the list, there's no point in voting, right?**

Incorrect! Local races are hugely important. Some examples: county prosecutors can, for instance, choose whether to prosecute non-violent drug crimes or sex work that is occurring without trafficking. 

They also recommend sentencing. Some are very strict, while some others choose to make those issues their lowest policy priority. 

State legislatures and governors decide, for instance, what happens with guns, lgbtq+ rights, and school funding in your state. 

State Attorneys General can defend state abortion laws or choose not to. 

Secretaries of State can help people register to vote or make it harder for them, within the already existing laws. 

--

**tl;dr - register to vote. for a lot of reasons. if you read the news, or reddit, i'm sure you can easily come up with some.**

if you have questions about registering in your particular state, comment and i'll do my best to help. i did election stuff as a job for a few years, and i know how complicated finding the information you need can be. that's why i'm making these guides now."|Wichita|2022|False|0

"I go to Singing River Dentistry in Madison. The care I get at the clinic is great but they go a bit crazy on all their outreach texts and calls. For example, I had an appointment on Monday. I have received texts every day asking for a review and expressing disappointment that I haven't left one yet.  I had another appointment 2 weeks ago, which I did review. So every appt comes with a barrage of review texts. 

I could possibly unsubscribe but they're very picky about getting responses.

Last year, I had a chipped tooth and they were able to book a next-day appointment. They sent me a confirmation text, which I responded to. Later in the day, they called me to confirm again but I missed it. When I went in the next morning, they had canceled the appointment since I didn't answer the phone. Even though it was booked and confirmed on the same day. I understand wanting confirmations due to the amount of no shows, but this seems excessive. 

Are all local dentists like this? Again the care I receive is great, it's just a weird experience having a dentist office that acts like a jealous girlfriend when they don't get enough attention"|HuntsvilleAlabama|2024|False|0

"Every once in awhile I think about this and today is the day I’ve decided to post about it. 

I think car flip posts are in bad taste. People get injured in these types of accidents, sometimes fatally. Then to have onlookers snap photos of them (mayhaps from their own cars?? Which is dangerous if you’re driving. Also creates traffic due to rubbernecking) and then post them to an online forum? I think I would be furious if someone did this to me. 

Isn’t it time to retire these types of posts? Haven’t we had our fair share? Do we have to make light of someone’s terrible day? Or the possible loss of life? There are so many other “quirky” New Orleans things we could post about. 

The fact that it’s in the banner for the sub and that we have flair for it doesn’t sit well with me either.

This is something that I would need for 3 days a week. My ex wife and i have an alternating weekly schedule, example below.

Week 1:

 * Wednesday: Pick me up in merrimack any time between 2:30-3:30pm and drive me to Londonderry to get my kids and drop us off back in Merrimack. 

* Thursday pick me and me and my kids up in Merrimack between 7-8am to drive to Londonderry then drive me back home after. Repeat the process between 2:30-3:30

* Friday Same morning routine but no afternoon routine.

Week 2:

* Monday: pick me up in Merrimack between 2:30-3:30pm and drive me to get my kids and then drive me and them back to Merrimack.

* Tuesday: same as the Thursday schedule listed above

* Wednesday: same as Friday schedule above.

This would be something i'd need for the next 3 months. Uber and Lyft rates for this route are about $30 each way so obviously i'd be willing to pay more than that. I will provide the carseats. Commute is abut 30-35 min each way.

"Happy (or sad) Monday guys!

Welcome to our new weekly meta post. Mindless Monday is generally for those things that do not deserve their own submission. That being said, this thread is free-for-all, and you can discuss politics, your life events, Whataburger, or whatever here. Just remember to not violate Rule 1, or we human mods will feed you to the bear. Like this idea and want to chat more? [Join us on IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/texas).

There are many things I can't replicate (wide open spaces, the feeling of walking into A/C when it's 100 outside, giant styrofoam cups with crushed ice and Dr. Pepper, that hot dry grass/dusty smell), but I've learned to cook food and play music that reminds me of home.

The thing with music though is that I can't remember the names of everything. There are songs that you hear a lot without taking notice of the name or the artist. I bet there are a lot of songs that people could suggest that would take me straight back, songs that I had heard but never would have remembered.

"#What is this new chat?

orangechat.io (OC) is an easy-to-use webchat, embedded directly in reddit.com.  It allows you to just click and connect with your reddit account and immediately start chatting with other people visiting your favorite subreddits.

There are two ways to use orangechat, the extension and the embedded version. 

Extension:  [CHROME](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/orangechatio/eikmifkdpckaoknomnbhoeoiiacopofh)  |  [FIREFOX](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/orangechatio/)

Using the extension is the easiest way to use orangechat.io - it will embed in the bottom right of your screen when you are browsing reddit and will display chat notifications.  However, we also have a stand-alone version available that can be used anywhere [HERE](https://app.orangechat.io/#/r/texas) - no download required!  

#What are some of the benefits? 
* No registration: just connect directly using your reddit account.  We never have access to your password, and you never need to provide an email address.
* Easy to use: no commands to remember and no prior knowledge required - we’re trying to keep it simple - no one should need a manual to join or moderate a chatroom.
* Connects with reddit.com: integrating with reddit lets us make some things very simple - for example, subreddit moderators are detected automatically, and can immediately begin managing the chatroom (including bans and invites).
* Private messages, private chatrooms: turn a private message into a private chatroom by inviting other friends to the conversation.  You can also rename your private chatrooms, making it easy to keep track of friends and teams… or just express yourself ;)
* IRC integration: Many subreddits already have existing IRC chatrooms, and we want to help you keep all of your subreddit chat in one place.  We’ve been working with [Snoonet](https://www.snoonet.org), which specifically serves the reddit community, and have set up a system that will let you link existing channels on Snoonet with OC channels.   Users comfortable with IRC can stay part of the conversation using any client of their choice, while others can connect through OC.  

#It connects to our existing chat!

You can either use the new chat, or you can connect using your client of choice to #texas on irc.snoonet.org, or you can use the [old browser link](http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/#texas).

"Sorry if this is a pretty stupid question 

Got a mate coming to brisbane soon for 7 days and we will be using public transport every day. 

He's a concession and not a child so it'd be much better to some how get concession fares rather than the full adult cost 

I've looked into the temporary go cards but they're like over $100 for like 3-5 days which is BEYOND ridiculous amounts of money 

Would I be able to go to a train station which sells go cards, and with my concession ID (I already own a concession go card), buy another one for my mate for the $10 fee 

I see this as a viable option but I'm questioning whether it's actually legal to have two concession cards under my name, and I don't want to have to face any hassles to do with it. I wouldn't be able to get my mate to come use his ID and get one, because we're using public transport as soon as he gets off the plane, and were gonna use busses which obviously you need a go card to board.

This story caught my attention on a random video. I was quite disheartened to see it occurred in Byram, Ms. 

As a MS resident, it is a shame the amount of child abuse, neglect, and endangerment rates we have in this state. 

Agencies are overwhelmed (DCFS) and understaffed. I’m not sure what the solution is, but firmly believe it starts within the community. It’s time to demand state funded resources be adequately staffed and funded, as well as have changes in policy to help the core issue of the problem. In my opinion, those issues are under/uneducated populations, poverty, declining community standards, lack of leadership. 

Citizens like the woman in the embedded clip in the article are plentiful in this state. It’s unfortunate that the dregs on society outnumber the good people here. 

Sorry for the negative Nancy post on a Sunday morning, but this story tugged at more than my heart strings. It’s not the typical “MS gang culture/violence/corruption/politics content I’ve gotten used to on this sub and in the media in general. 

I know there are answers to MS’s problems. But we really need to start in our own backyards and communities. If only there was support for efforts that would benefit the core issues I mentioned, things could take an upward turn in many facets of the state that have been failing lately."|Mississippi|2023|False|0

I'm planning on going to Vegas in early July, however I will be out of the country until July 4th. The problem is my 21th birthday is during the international trip so I will only be able to go to the DMV for my new license once I get back and they give you a temporary paper but I don't think the real one will come in the mail on time for my Vegas trip.

Will this be a huge problem? I am planning on bringing the voided/expired ID in addition to the new paper temporary one. Should I bring my passport as well? Do bars and casinos even accept passports as a form of checking legal age? Because I know some places (where I live) have a scanner that scans IDs to make sure your ID is authentic but not a Passport scanner so they deny people who have a passport but no ID.

"Greetings r/losangeles,

I have the summer off from work and have been wanting to do a tour of all of the best/must go restaurants, food trucks, and general eateries across LA and Orange County!  

I went to school on the east coast and have friends who visit regularly , so  i'm always the person they reach out to for good recommendations. I've also developed a certain reputation among my family and friends for being the one to step out and try new and low key food spots in every area we visit. 

I find myself sometimes being very limited in places I'd like to try due to people not being interested in trying something completely different or they have never heard of. Hence what brings me to the idea for this journey of culinary exploration and enlightenment so I can not only share with with friends and family, but with the reddit community as well!  

I would love your suggestions of must try places in LA and Orange County to get the ball rolling. Your inspiration would be greatly appreciated and i'd share and update you guys regularly with my impressions of the people involved with the business , the food, and of course pictures and blurbs of anyone I speak to during my tour.

###Join us!

**Look forward to the Antelope Valley becoming alive with rando meet-ups.** Please, please, please come and let me know what ya'll are interested in doing. In the past, I've hosted a wee [NYE Party](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/44867072/), a couple [Halloween](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/29917851/) [Parties](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/213752052/), [Porn Star Karaoke](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/18524951/), [Industry Mixers](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/27922741/), Scary Movie Nights, [Photography Meet-ups](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/23178611/), [Movie Screenings](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/19115891/), [Museum Trips](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/18519901/), [Game Nights](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/40236882/), couple of kick-ass [GrMuDs](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/60836982/), and sweet baby jaysus... so. many. more...

Depending on how many people **[RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/240400234/)**, there's a small chance that we'll have to meet somewhere else. I'll let you know a couple days before if we have to change venues.

###FAQs:    
* ""*I've never been to a meet-up before and am scared. What should I expect and should I wear my fedora?*""

  I've met a crap-load of redditors and 99% of them are **really nice, very bright, and have a teensy dash of autism/ocd/anxiety disorder**. Salt of the Earth, I tell ya!    

  Don't worry! There will be booze and name tags. You don't even have to talk. You can just drink and listen. But, **be prepared to make friends** (uuuug, I know, huh?).

* ""*Do I have to live in the AV to meet up with you guys?*""

  No! Feel free to **take a beautiful drive through the mountains and come hang out**. Palmdale and Lancaster (and the general Antelope Valley) get bad raps, but it's beautiful up here. Come out and actually see the stars!

I've also been told that Holland is very religious as well..so I'm also kind of reluctant about moving out there as well or just wondering if I would personally like the city itself.

Just a bit of information about myself. I'm a raver and love EDM music!! Now.. I know that I probably will not find that in Holland and that is okay. I am aware that I have to put that part of my life on hold until I get my degree. I'm also Cali born and raised and I have never lived outside of California... All and all, I'm just very hesitant and unsure about me liking Holland... So if you guys can answer these questions for me as well as expanding about what you love about Holland, that would be great. It will also be cool to start talking to people as well that are attending GVSU or living in the Holland area so I can make some new friends."|Michigan|2020|False|0
"Not rumor. Public info. I found this out today.

Fiber is closing all full service Fiber Spaces except West Des Moines and Orange County. This means here in Kansas City (Zona Rosa and Westport), Austin, Huntsville, and Provo will no longer have a full service Fiber Space for equipment or customer service issues. 

The last day open is tomorrow according to the sign in the building. According to the employees, most of the equipment is now gone, and they are all losing their jobs after tomorrow, so I wouldn't bother going down there on their last day packing up everything up.

"I have had a bad infestation of pantry moths in my house since early August, which I assumed came in from contaminated food, and I have been doing everything to try and combat them. First, I threw all pantry items away, cleaned heavily, and used pheromone traps to catch the male moths. Secondly, I purchased Trichogramma Wasps which are microscopic parasitic wasps that are supposed to take out the pantry moth larvae. And recently I've even had pest control come to try to help with the fight, all to no avail so far.

Today I was outside and noticed several of these same moths on the OUTSIDE of my window screen trying to get into the house. Are these moths native to the Missouri/Kansas area? Do I have some kind of outdoor infestation going on? I'm very disturbed by this and am becoming worried that I will never get rid of them.

"After watching my wife almost get killed by a texting teenage driver on 85th and the trolley trail track I've created a list of grievances. For a trail that connects tens of thousands of residents to shopping, transportation and one many would use today (cause it's nice AF outside), why is it ass?

Why are we dealing with:

\- Washed out sections of road, you're popping a tire on your bike if you hit some of these or at least could fall off. These are great at night when the non-existent street lights light up the track. Uneven road surfaces are everywhere along the trail but especially near KC Bier co where the gravel is semi washed out and it's like you're testing out the [suspension of a car and defusing a bomb.](https://youtu.be/VTHJ7G8J8OE?t=150)

\- Shitty unreadable sun damaged signage

\- Broken or missing bollards that are jagged and hide under dirt and gravel, again definitely could pop a bike tire on these.

\- The gravel that meets the track's paved intersections are huge bumps for bike riders, and shows no maintenance is being done to keep the track from eroding.

\- No shade???? When it's 90 degrees outside a shady walk or ride can be nice, when it's 85 and the sun is baking you, it's not nice.

\- The light at 85th, where my wife was almost killed, is dangerous. At least could we get some signage in the middle of the road and some brighter flashing lights? Do we have to wait until someone is [killed before it matters?](https://fox4kc.com/news/pedestrian-sustains-life-threatening-injuries-after-vehicle-hits-them-near-63rd-and-brookside-plaza/)

\- Stopping every 500 feet to wait for a street light to change and watch drivers not pay attention to crossing pedestrians sucks.

\- This is grasping at an issue, but the trail could connect even more people and commerce by building to the plaza.

&#x200B;

How can we push city government to maintain our walking and biking infrastructure?  


  


Edit: I called 311, and while KCMO now owns the TTT (Trolley Track Trail) KCATA still maintains it. I've asked for the washed out areas and the missing bollards be replaced, as well as the lips at the start of intersections be looked into. I've also brought up the safety issue on 85th and the TTT and they said they would pass that along as a suggestion. Also, shout out to the 311 and KCATA representatives, they were super nice and I feel like my voice on some of these issues have been heard."|KansasCity|2022|False|0

"Hey all! 

Last night my boyfriend and I were camping at a campground in Lolo, next to the town Wye (we are travelling from NY), and both of us are perplexed as to what the noise we were hearing could be as we haven't heard anything like it before. I've camped in MT many times in the past, too. Maybe we are just a little stupid, though?

It's admittedly hard to describe, but I'll do my best. Sounds like a muffled bass coming from a speaker far away, it starts and gradually gets faster, then stops (much like when you are bouncing a basketball and stop, it will gradually get faster as it gets closer to the ground, until it stops bouncing). 

My boyfriend first heard it around 3 AM and thought he was going nuts. It kept going and eventually we left, happened in intervals of 5 or 10 minutes. 

It sounded muffled in its tone but it was pretty loud and irritating, just since it is a lower frequency noise you can't ignore. 

What is it? Anyone know? Genuinely curious!"|Montana|2016|False|0

"Hi, I am an out of state guy so I'm unable to go back to where this was. I was pulled over on I-85 Northbound for going 76 in a 60 zone. Normally, I would accept tickets because I am that guy that will admit I am wrong. However, I never saw a sign for 60, and I had my car in cruise control at 75. On a hill it pushed my speed to 76, where he clocked me, but put it down to 75 because I told him I had no idea. Plus, I was behind a car and didn't see myself creeping up on him, I felt like part of the flow of traffic. I asked him where it said 60 mph, because I had honestly never seen a sign for it. He stated it was back at 104(mile marker or exit, I don't know.) however, as we left I saw signs for 70 still and cars that were going much faster than me when I went 70. When I caught up to speed with traffic, they all pushed 80 and were still crawling away from me.

All I am wondering is, is there a 60 zone at the location the trooper described? If so I will accept the offense and will blame to myself on not being aware. I'm going through Google and trying to see where it is, I went to mile marker 104 and through it, but saw nothing. Prior to 104 I was a 70mph sign. This happened this past Monday. Should I just call the number on the ticket(by the way, you guys have HUGE tickets.)

Edit: Also, how much am I looking at? Nothing seems to tell me on points and costs. He said the ticket will take time to process, so he told us to wait for it to go through."|Virginia|2017|False|0

"Hey Indy.

Just this year I began to explore the world of tequila, and I've been getting most of my starter recommendations from r/tequila. (They're a wonderful community and extremely helpful for anyone who wants to know more about real and amazing tequila and mezcal.)

Anyway, I wanted to ask if you guys have any recommendations on liquor stores with solid tequila selections. And before I go any further, I want to note that **I'm looking for 100% agave tequilas that aren't made with diffusers**. So no, I don't care about Cuervo or some of the other super cheap mixtos that most Americans identify as ""tequila.""

In particular, I really want to pick up a few bottles of Mi Campo blanco. It's a fantastic new tequila (released just this last November, actually) that's in the $18-25 price point range. I came across it at Sangrita Saloon in Broad Ripple since they're using it as their well. I've looked all over Broad Ripple and some of southern Carmel for it but haven't found any so far.

If you guys have *any* recommendations for liquor stores with hidden gems or just solid selections, please let me know. Also, just because I live on the north side of Indy doesn't mean I won't travel to get a few bottles. My girlfriend works in Speedway and she has family on the south side, so I'm covered everywhere.

**TL;DR:** Looking to buy bottles of nicer sipping tequilas in liquor stores that may have strong tequila selections or hidden gems (such as some older bottles from small family-owned shops). In particular, I'd love to pick up some products of Mi Campo, Fortaleza, G4, Pasote, Siete Leguas, Tapatio, and El Tesoro. I like blancos and reposados the most, but I'm open to great añejos too."|Indianapolis|2019|False|0

"I would like to do a delayed vaccine schedule with my child who is due in October. Mainly I want to delay the HepB - I do NOT want it at birth from the hospital. I would like to space them out, one at a time,  and avoid things like Flu maybe even avoid the RV.

Has anyone done this with their children and if so could you give me a rough idea of their schedule and how to talk to doctors about this in a non-confrontational way.

I want to make this super CLEAR - I want to vaccinate however I want to delay and spread out the vaccines as much as possible. I would also like to drop some of the vaccines which do not prevent life threatening diseases (such as flu and RV)

Thanks so much in advance!

Edit: The personal attacks are childish. So I wont be responding to any more of them. Delayed vaccines does not equal no vaccines however trying to explain that to people is like screaming at a wall. So! If you happened to have used a delayed schedule in MA please pm me! Very interested in your personal experience! If your here to demonize and swear at people feel free to do so below but dont expect a reply or for me to sit here and defend my familes choices. Instead of leaving a nasty comment I would suggest researching both the vaccine inserts and what each vaccine actually does to better understand the topic.

"How much are you paying for eggs?  
  
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is reporting that egg prices in the United States rose dramatically in August, up 28.1 percent from the same period a year ago.

That brought the average national price for a dozen grade eggs to $3.20 in August, according to the BLS. But Connecticut consumers, as well as industry and supermarket officials, say that since then, prices in retailers across the state have begun to decline.

The reason for the price spike is a reduction in the number of hens laying eggs as a result of the Avian flu, said Meghan Bell, a spokeswoman for the Norwalk-based family-owned grocery chain Stew Leonard's.

"Hi. Here's some small advice for when you shop and Stop & Shop.

* Make sure to scan your card/enter your phone number at the savings station once you walk into the store to quickly load in the Digital Coupons. (Ex. In Hamden, the Savings Station is located on the produce side right at the end of Register 21)
* Hamden Stop & Shop closes at midnight every day unless otherwise
* If a sale is too good to be true, double check the location of an item and the tag or ask a store associate before purchasing
* At Hamden Stop & Shop, the doors on the Pharmacy side close at 8pm every night for safety reasons
* At Hamden Stop & Shop, since August 25th of this year, the service desk closes at 7pm.
* Want to keep track of how much you are spending? Pick up a Scan It by the door once you enter the store or use the Scan It app on your phone. It will also, make things go by quicker for both the cashier and the customer. 
* Want to use your Go Points for groceries? Redeem them through the App or the website. Every 100 points is $1 off in groceries.
* Monday-Saturday the store stops selling alcohol at 10pm. On Sundays, the store stops selling alcohol at 6pm.
* Purchasing cold medicine? Make sure to an ID on you. If it has Pseudoephedrine in it, the employee will need to see your ID. *(Pseudoephedrine is found in a number of cold-and-flu tablets, and is known to be an “illicit drug precursor” because it can be diverted into the manufacture of amphetamine-type substances. In some states, only people 18 years of age or older can buy pseudoephedrine.)*

"Whether you call it nCoV-19 or COVID-19 or just “The Coronavirus,” it is here in West Virginia and, undoubtedly, a hell of a lot closer than that.  More reports of confirmed cases in this state and others are coming.  Just keep clean, stay clean, stay home, minimize any contact with others, and you may be OK.

First:  80% of people who DO contract this virus will get sick.  It will not be bad, any more than having the flu or a chest cold might feel.  Those are mild cases.  Isolate yourself.  *Do not have contact with anyone* if it can be avoided.  If you NEED to have physical contact with others, assuming other people in your home, put yourself in a bedroom with bathroom access and lock those areas off.  You have become part of the problem.  

No medical intervention is required with a mild case of COVID-19.  Repeat:  **No medical intervention is required for a mild case of COVID-19.**  but you DO need to keep from giving it to your loved ones or roommates.  Restrict your movements to the two rooms.  Do not let anyone inside those two rooms but people sick with this virus.  This is now your own, personal hot zone.  If you have to leave that room to go to a communal bathroom, wipe down anything and everything in that communal bathroom that you are certain you have touched AND the areas you MAY have touched after you are finished.  Use a clean cloth or paper to touch sink knobs, or toilet handles, or door handles.  IF your skin meets physical contact with a surface, it should be wiped clean as soon as possible.  Have others bring you food if you can, but remember that you are “hot.”  You can be shedding the virus.  That means don’t touch *anybody*, and your plates and silverware and cups are all going to be “hot” until they are adequately cleaned.  **This is only if you believe that you or another has the virus.**

If you are certain you do NOT have the virus, you MAY still have it.  You are just not symptomatic.  But your body is reproducing the virus and putting it out of your body in a solution of droplets:  a sneeze, sweat, snot, blood, anything.  Those droplets are “hot.”  One of the many problems with this particular virus is that you can have it for days and not be aware you are contagious.  Yes, you can be contagious and make others sick without knowing it.  Think about that before you need to leave your house for anything.  
**Do not interact physically with anyone if you suspect you MAY have the virus.**  

If you get to a point where going somewhere else is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, you need to think as if everything you touch, or somebody else touches and then you touch, is contaminated until it can be verified clean.
**Again:  outside of your personal space, consider anything AND everything you touch, anything and everything someone passes to you, contaminated until you can clean it.**  YOUR HANDS will be most of the problem.  They will come in contact with surfaces that may have live virus on them.  Even if you wear gloves, if you touch something with live virus, you can infect yourself if you touch yourself in an area of broken skin or moist mucosa like your eyes, nose, or mouth.  **YOU MUST BE ALERT TO EVERYTHING YOUR HANDS ARE DOING AND WHAT THEY TOUCH.**  

If you contact anything you are not absolutely certain about, wipe your hands clean before you touch yourself anywhere.  This means things you never consciously think about:  **your cellphone.  Touch screens.  ATMs.  Door handles.  ANYTHING YOU TOUCH THAT YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IS CLEAN CAN INFECT YOU.**

Does all of this sound like crazy paranoia and the rantings of an OCD lunatic?  Welcome to the party.  Because you need to be that way in order to keep yourself and others well.  

I know people want to think a barrier like gloves will help.  Only if you changed gloves EVERY SINGLE TIME you touched something or before you touched your face.  That is patently impractical and would destroy resources you need to keep and others need to have. 

If you choose to wear a mask of any kind:  understand that it is largely a barrier to keep YOU from shedding it nasally or orally, or to KEEP you from infecting yourself nasally or orally.  That’s all it can do.  I can explain micron sizes of viruses and masks.  Doesn’t matter.  Those are the only two uses for masks.  If you don’t need them for those reasons, don’t use them!  Don’t buy them!  Others will!  Not just doctors, hospitals, first responders, but people like cancer patients, others with weak or compromised immune systems and countless others you are not thinking about.  But you cannot feel safe wearing ANY kind of mask.  You can still touch your eyes, or other things can touch your eyes unless they are sealed off behind a face shield or sealing goggles that would then need to be disinfected before being used again.  

**WASHING YOUR HANDS AND STAYING AWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE TOUCHING AT ALL TIMES IS GOING TO HELP YOU STAY WELL.**  Wash under warm water for 20 seconds, scrubbing your hands completely.  If you want to feel like a doctor doing it, more power to you, as long as your hands get completely clean doing it, because the very next thing you touch, a towel or a door knob, or a box of Rice Krispies, can expose those clean hands to virus again.  I can explain lipid layers and viruses all day.  This is what you NEED to know:  *Wash your damned hands the way you should have always been doing it anyway.  Then keep them in your pockets (assuming they are virus free) or away from any surface.*  **20 seconds is about how long it takes to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to someone twice.  Depending on how quickly you sing it, THAT will not make your hands cleaner.  Only the 20 seconds of warm water and soap can do that.**

TRY to keep a clean bottle of hand sanitizer and use it liberally, as if your life depended on it.  **This virus can live on certain surfaces for up to 9 days.**  Alcohol can kill it.  Isopropyl or rubbing alcohol can kill it, but if you can avoid retouching surfaces, do so.  ANY contact with a surface can expose you.  

**DO NOT SHARE FOOD OR DRINK WITH ANYONE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.**  YOU might have it.  THEY might have it.  Sharing just means you can have it TOGETHER.  Don’t do it.  Don’t eat out of communal containers like popcorn or other snacks.  

We need to take care of ourselves first, if we want to help anyone else, AND WE NEED TO HELP OTHERS, TOO.  If that means NOT HOARDING TOILET PAPER, then don’t be an idiot and get only as much as you are going to need.  Don’t buy face masks or gloves if you don’t need to.  Keep to yourself, don’t go to public areas, don’t physically contact or even come within spitting distance of other people if you can avoid it in any way.

"I'm posting this from a comment of information I put together. I'm hoping that if anyone has family, coworkers or friends who are ignoring or not grasping the danger for WV will have this information to help put in to perspective the risk that WV is facing.

It's going to hit WV really bad. [Read what the WV Governor is telling people](http://wvmetronews.com/2020/03/16/justice-act-as-if-its-here-testing-capacity-is-frustrating-no-need-yet-to-shut-down-bars-and-restaurants/)

>The state leaders expressed frustration that only 500 testing kits have been available in West Virginia so far — and those have only been made functional by jerry-rigging some flu test kits.

Right now WV has no testing kits from a national level sent to help. The hospitals in the state have figured out how to test using existing flu test kits and information available on the COVID-19.  [16% of the state is over 65](http://censusviewer.com/state/WV), and most of the over-65 are *over 75*!

[26% of people smoke in WV](https://truthinitiative.org/research-resources/smoking-region/tobacco-use-west-virginia-2019), and WV is [often tied with](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/Obesity/state/WV) or [is the most obese state](https://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/west-virginia-ranks-as-most-obese-state/article_8940981f-c9df-588d-be98-4ee748b431f5.html).

[WV is a walking time bomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/weve-got-a-monster-thats-looming-west-virginia-is-the-last-state-without-a-coronavirus-case.html?searchResultPosition=1). Compare Italy, right now with 7.7% mortality rate, much of which is due to the [aging population with a median of 47.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/) Then compare small towns in WV like [Grafton, WV with a median age of 45](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/grafton-wv-population/). WV is sprinkled with small towns with similar demographics.

Now combine all of this with the [worst state for opioid deaths and prescriptions](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-summaries-by-state), the [bias from conservative news on corona virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-conservative-media.html), and that [Trump won WV in 2016 by over 40 points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_West_Virginia). And finally add in that [a major regional hospital in WV is closing right now!](https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/business/2020/02/fairmont-regional-medical-center-to-close/)

There are going to be a lot of very sad stories coming out of WV very soon, and at this point it's going to be very difficult to turn the tide in favor of the aging population. That said, I've had success sending family members [this excerpt from the Joe Rogan and an Epidemiologist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFhjMQrVts&feature=emb_title) or a view of how newspapers have had to [show so many more obituaries](https://twitter.com/benphillips76/status/1238854071509016577?s=09)."|WestVirginia|2020|True|0
"If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent social distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [190,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf))

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* **Update:** March 17th: [Short video of the situation in a hospital in Bergamo, Italy](https://twitter.com/Laethageal/status/1239699270577553409). Do not underestimate this virus.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). Update: [Speed trumps perfection](https://twitter.com/ConallMcD/status/1238865202868883461).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm)

70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w)

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Hey y’all, I got the COVID vaccine Friday so I figured I’d share my experience/give you the rundown of what it’s like here in RI. I’ve also included links to the current situation over here/more info about the COVID vaccine in general.

I work as a healthcare professional, so we all got emails from the board of health when it was our specific field’s turn to get the vaccine. The email included directions to the facility/a link to the website, which asked a series of questions; have we contracted COVID, any current symptoms, any contact with a person that was infected, and whether or not we’ve been required to quarantine within the past few weeks. Next, we gave our phone number, street and email addresses and a photo copy of health insurance cards. After that, you specify whether it’s your first or second dose, and are given a list of dates and times to chose from. I specifically got the Moderna vaccine, which requires you to come back in 28 days for the second dose. You will set up the second appointment during your first visit.

The day before my appointment, I got a reminder in my email including more directions to the facility in Cranston. On the day of, I arrived to the parking lot to be greeted by military personnel asking if I had an appointment. After that, I was flagged to the parking lot and went inside to a series of “check points”. At the first, my temperature was taken by a military official and I was sent forward to the next station. There were about 6 of us in line (at 6 feet apart) and we were asked the same COVID questions as the online questionnaire, then sent forward to the next station. I was asked to give my license, and he wrote down my info on a card and sent me forward. At the next station, I was asked which arm I would like to have the shot in, and she wrote it down on a slip/copied some of the info from the card and gave both the card and slip to me (the slip you eventually give back to military personnel, the card you keep - according to the military official who gave me the shot, you need to keep this as it is your only means of proving you’ve gotten the vaccine). I was then sent forward to my own booth, where another military official asked if I’ve ever had any adverse reactions to a vaccine and administered it. The shot itself felt no different to me than getting a flu shot, but I’ve heard varied responses to this from my colleagues; this could obviously be different for everyone regarding your own health issues/past experiences with vaccines/pain threshold and tolerance. I also recommend you bring your own band aid if you have issues with bleeding (are on blood thinners, aspirin regimen etc.) as they did not supply me with one. 

After getting my dose, he checked off my card and I was sent to an “observatory station” where I was required to sit for 15 minutes - they wrote the current time/the time I could move forward on my slip. Once I got to the observatory station, there was a laminated piece of paper on my chair with a QR code. I used the camera in my phone to scan the QR code, which brought me to the website to set up my second appointment. It immediately brings you to at least 28 days later and the process was the same setup as it was for the initial appointment. Once the 15 minutes were up, I went up to the desk where the observing military personnel were. They asked if I felt ok, was there any dizziness/discomfort and signed off on my slip. I was then sent forward to the final station where I gave my slip to the military official, was asked if I had any other questions and was free to go out the back entrance.

The first night after getting the shot was fine, I felt a little sore but nothing extreme. For the rest of the weekend, my arm felt like it was punched a total of 20 times and it was uncomfortable to lift past my ribs. Today it is more or less back to normal.

I also wanted to add, the military personnel were hilarious and made the whole situation way less boring than it could’ve been.

[Here is a link to the current COVID vaccine info in Rhode Island](https://covid.ri.gov/vaccination). This link includes weekly updates and specifics on when each group (healthcare or otherwise) is expected to be eligible. Feel free to ask me any questions :)

"If you look around the country and the world the numbers are high but for some reason there are a few places like Nebraska where the numbers are staying really low (comparatively) and I do not understand why.  Is there something special about this area?  Is the airbase's OmaDome killing Covid?  Are nebraskans just super saiyans and covid doesn't stand a chance against us?  Why are we so special?


I guess I should edit this.  mvoviri pointed out we are 5th highest in infections but according to how the state is handling things and the current hospital trend you would not think this.  Do we have a high infection rate and a low severe infection rate?  Why are our numbers dropping like the bass at a skrillex concert?  Why does life seem so normal here vs other places that are maxed out hospital wise and locking things down?  Nothing lines up and it is very confusing what is happening.

"EDIT: sold. Thank you. 

Many years ago, I purchased a few original Harper's Weekly newspapers featuring the engravings of Thomas Nast, including ""The Blessings of Victory"".    I framed a couple for myself (this one and another celebrating July 4th 1864) and placed the other on a shelf and forgot about it until my wife and I were doing a little quarantine clear-out.

This is from an auction site regarding this particular print ""The Blessings of Victory"" and Thomas Nast:

>Nast engraves an optimistic scene of what was to come with victory of the Union. Two women hold hands, one raises a palm leaf while the other raises her sword. Six separate scenes surround them showing prisoner's of war being released, a veteran coming home, happy African Americans no longer bound by slavery, and the traitors in prison.  
>  
>Nast is credited for being the ""Father of the American Cartoon"" and is considered one of the most popular political cartoonists of all time. He created many still-popular images such as: the elephant and donkey as representations for the Democratic and Republican party, the modern Santa Claus, and other iconic political cartoons. He sparred against political corruption and slavery. Lincoln hailed him as the ""best recruiting sergeant"" for the Union because his images inspired many men to enlist. He continued to sketch until 1902 when President Roosevelt appointed him U.S. counsel general for Ecuador. He entered Ecuador in the midst of a massive yellow fever outbreak. He contracted the disease and died, leaving behind many unpaid debts but a lasting artistic legacy. 

This particular piece was printed in Harper's Weekly on September 24th, 1864 as part of a campaign of pro-Union engravings leading up to the election.

I'm selling the entire newspaper, not just the centerfold for $75, the minimum I've seen this sold online for.  It also has other engraving illustrations.  [Here's an amazon digital copy.](https://www.amazon.com/Harpers-Weekly-September-24-1864/dp/1557098026)

"COVID QUESTIONS. Anyone able to help?

Hi all. 

I’ve been out of work for the last two weeks with a myriad of symptoms.  Refused to be hospitalized two weeks ago due to cost concerns with my insurance, but the issues range from low oxygen levels, shortness of breath, mild to high fever, fatigue and body pain. 

I took a covid test on October 16th, it came back negative.  I have had chest X-rays done as well, which didn’t show signs of pneumonia.  Been on antibiotics shortly, and about to start a second round of steroids.  

I have a large deductible and not in a financial position to go to the hospital unless I was dying.   However, I still don’t have a confirmed Covid diagnosis.  I asked my doctor if I should take another test and she said that it wasn’t necessary because it wouldn’t change the treatment plan.   Another doctor in her office said that it was utmost important.  Obviously I’m also worried about getting a positive diagnosis and having that as a pre-existing condition.  So I’m really confused right now and I’ve already seemingly had a false negative or an insufficient swab.  

Work has been allowing me to not be there, but they believe they need a positive diagnosis for Covid, to pay me under the Family’s First Act.   The tests however also come with a disclaimer that it isn’t always accurate and that docs should use additional data to make a diagnosis.  

Has anyone had any similar difficulties navigating this or might have any insight as to how I can best proceed while also not putting myself into financial hardship?  Everytime I ask my doctor if I can rule out covid, she says no, but meanwhile, I can’t go back to work because I’m symptomatic and haven’t had a three day window without a fever.  But she also won’t say that I have covid.  What do I do??"|Ohio|2020|True|1
"Hey, y’all. My family just moved from the Deep South to Indianapolis this summer. We love the town and our neighbors, but my partner and I are a bit worried about our kids getting cabin fever during the winter months. 

We have a house with a backyard, and we’re pretty well outfitted with cold weather gear. I’m thinking maybe we could set up some sort of semi-permanent obstacle course in the backyard, maybe? We usually take them to parks or trails or playgrounds, but the kids are young enough that their mittens (and their hands, for that matter) aren’t super flexible and useful, so I’m not confident in their abilities to hang on to ladders and stuff at playgrounds. 

So I turn to the collected knowledge of the Indianapolis subreddit - what do y’all do with your kids, or what did you do as a kid? How do you get the energy out? Any suggestions are super welcome! Thanks!"|Indianapolis|2020|True|0

"I caught it in November, ignored it because it seemed like it was just seasonal allergies at first. That developed into a full blown respiratory infection that took the entire month to get rid of.

"Hi, I have 4 dogs well-established at a vet clinic. One dog is sensitive to vaccines, so we did the annual exam last week and the vet split the vaccine cocktail into two sessions. 

Today we came back just for Lepto and was charged for an exam. The vet told me state law says:

1) Aside from Bordetella, only vets (not techs) can administer vaccines 

2) Exam and exam fee is required before administering a vaccine 

Last year at a different TX vet I could get all 4 dogs vaccinated against the canine flu under 1 “office visit” expense + 4 vaccines. 

Did something change with the law or am I being played?

"While millions of Texans remain without power following Hurricane Beryl, The National Weather Service of Houston has issued a heat advisory for Tuesday. The humidity can cause the heat to feel even hotter and the amount of water vapor in the air can make sweating less effective, making it more difficult to stay cool.

If you're without power, here are some tips to stay cool, signs of heat illness to watch out for and how to stay safe if using a generator.

  
**How to keep your residence cool:**

* Keep sunny windows covered with curtains, shades or blinds.
* If you have a gas stove and oven that can run without electricity, try to minimize its use.
* If it’s safe for you to travel, consider going to a public library or emergency shelter with power. Even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler when you go back into the heat.
* Follow city officials and local media to see if any hurricane emergency relief shelters are open and have power. 

  
**How to keep yourself cool:**

* Drink water consistently – even when not thirsty. Avoid sugary drinks, caffeine and alcohol. Also avoid cold drinks because they can cause stomach cramps.
* Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing.
* Minimize recreational exercise as your body will struggle to cool back down.
* Take cool showers or baths.
* Avoid large, hot meals because they add heat to your body. 
* Know if your medication makes you vulnerable. Some medications might make skin more sensitive to the sun or make you feel less thirsty. These include aspirin and acetaminophen, diuretics and beta blockers, psychiatric medications such as lithium, and anti-seizure medications such as Topiramate and Oxcarbazepine. High temperatures can also damage a medication if it’s not stored properly, or make inhalers or EpiPens malfunction, according to the \~CDC\~.
* Avoid stimulants and hallucinogens. Street drugs like cocaine and MDMA can reduce how much you sweat, reduce how much your skin blood vessels enlarge and impair your perception of heat.

  
**Signs of heat illness to watch out for:**

Promptly take action if you or someone else starts to feel sick. Check in on friends and relatives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heat-related illnesses include:

* **Heat exhaustion:** Marked by profuse sweating, clammy skin, nausea, dizziness, headache and fainting. The CDC recommends that people with those symptoms move to a cool place, loosen clothes, put wet cloths on your skin and drink water. Get medical help if you are throwing up, your symptoms worsen or your symptoms last more than an hour.
* **Heat stroke:** Body temperature of 103 degrees or more, rapid pulse, throbbing headache, confusion and passing out. This can be life-threatening. Call 911 immediately, move to a cooler place, put cool cloths on skin and don’t drink anything.
* **Heat cramps:** Symptoms include muscle pain and spasms and lots of sweating. Stop physical activity, go to a cool place and drink water or a sports drink. Wait until the cramps have gone away to continue physical activity. If your cramps last more than an hour or you have heart problems or are on a low-sodium diet, seek medical attention.
* **Heat rash:** Also called prickly heat, this is when small red blisters form on the skin. Stay in a cool and dry place, keep the rash dry and use baby powder to soothe the rash.

  
**How to stay safe if using a generator:** 

* Carbon monoxide is produced when not enough oxygen is reaching a fuel-burning source.
* Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, colorless gas that can cause serious injury or even death if inhaled in large quantities. Early symptoms can include headache, dizziness and nausea, similar to the flu. If you feel these symptoms and suspect poisoning, leave the house immediately and seek medical help.
* Make sure to have a carbon monoxide alarm installed in your home before using a generator. If the alarm goes off, leave the home immediately and call 911.

"The head of an influential hospital trade group told a legislative committee Thursday that the state has had a “terrifying increase” in the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients over the past month, as medical facilities are contending with shortages in staffing and available beds. “As of Tuesday, there were 1,411 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [statewide]. A month ago there were 550,” said Steve Walsh, president and chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association. “And if that trend continues after the New Year, we’re going to have increasing problems,” he said. A mass casualty incident or bad flu outbreak could then hinder the capability of the hospital system to cope with demands, he said.

I was in a crash a few days ago. I was at a break in double white lines indicating right.

It was some 20year old guy, said sorry heaps at the time, gave me his details. I called insurance company and the little punk has filed it as me being at fault. Insurance company said they won't repair my car until he admits fault since I've only got third party. It's taking me 4 hours on hold to get through to insurance company each time I call and I need a car urgently for kids school drop off and work so this whole thing is a nightmare.

"Hey ya'll, 

My partner moved to Providence recently and he's had a doozy of issues since moving here, only 2 months ago. 

One of them is that there is an overwhelmingly disgusting smell coming from his shower drain, to the point where he's had constant headaches. He investigated the drain and saw the pipe was rusty and falling apart. He mentioned it to the landlord and he came by and brought a plumber to fix the pipe, thinking that would solve the problem. 

Nope, gas smell is still engulfing his bathroom. It's disgusting. He brings up the smell again the landlord and says for my partner to find a plumber to deal with it. He has GEM come by and the technicians literally say they can't smell anything, and just recock the wax around the toilet (they were basically useless). 

When the landlord was by the place he also said he couldn't smell anything. I feel bad because my partner has been going crazy about the smell and it's effecting his health, he can't even take a shower in his own apartment (he comes over to my place to use mine.)

Finally he went to Home Depot and got a gas detector that let's you know if there is a gas leak and low-and-behold, it detects a gas from his shower drain. He took videos demonstrating the gas detector going off to send to the landlord tomorrow. 

I've been doing research to find out what his rights are exactly as a tenant in this situation. It seems like the landlord isn't taking him seriously / doesn't care and it's frustrating. I found in some cases this can be a breach of an agreement in his lease as it's hazardous to have a gas leak into the apartment that can effect your health - making it uninhabitable. Any recommendations or advice is welcome.

I feel bad because he just moved to Providence and this is his experience so far. (outside of a number of things that have happened within the span of 2 months that have been not great.) "|RhodeIsland|2024|True|0

"I'm originally from the Mid West but lived in Idaho at about 4,800ft elevation for 4 years. I frequently visited family in the Midwest & South and never had any problems.

"WCCO aired the first in a series of reports on the fentanyl crisis in Minnesota.  

The accompanying web article states that “We start with the problem. Last year alone, the Drug Enforcement Agency seized the equivalent of more than 387 million lethal doses of fentanyl….”

Like so many other drug-related news stories, they’ve totally missed the mark by focusing on the supply rather than the demand for fentanyl.  Any news story that suggests it’s “starting with the problem” and doesn’t address the demand is focusing on the symptom rather than the cause.  Stories like this, unfortunately, shift the attention of the public, and move us away from dealing with the heart of the issue.

"Hi,

Posting to see if anyone here has had to navigate treatment for an unwilling parent suffering from severe mental illness. My mother’s mental health has dramatically declined since symptoms first began to appear in early months of Covid during 2020. She is convinced the government is attempting to take her life and that her family (us) are also involved in the conspiracy.

She has refused to get help and claims instead that everyone around her is mentally deranged. We know part of the disease is the inability of the person suffering to realize they are ill. She is in her 60s and her health is deteriorating.

Note she still eats but her weight has fallen significantly. Bulk of what she consumes now consists of plastic, gas station esque food since she is convinced fresh produce (I.e. not plastic sealed) has been poisoned in advance. 

We don’t know what to do at this point beyond trying our best to tolerate and be patient; however, I am afraid she can’t continue much longer like this given her already frail health prior to this illness taking her.

Has anyone gone through the same that can consult? She’s cautious to avoid saying things related to self harm to avoid us calling police/recording for court. We previously had her hospitalized for a day related to extremely high blood pressure during an episode of psychosis, but doctors released her immediately after.

NAMI offered little in terms of any leeway we have navigating legal system to get her mandatory treatment. We know the threshold for forced treatment is high but there has to be some type of short cuts or tricks even as far as falsely claiming she has threatened suicide. At this point, letting her continue untreated is the equivalent of a death sentence."|Chicago|2023|False|0
"I had/have mild symptoms (super sore throat, runny nose) and so I knew I should get tested - but the question was how, without putting other people at risk?  I don't have a car and while there is a testing clinic within walking distance of my home, it is drive-through only.

After some searching around it came to my attention there is self-testing available in Sydney through Histopath ([covidtestsydney.com.au](https://covidtestsydney.com.au)).  A testing kit is couriered to you and returned to pathology, without you needing to leave the house at all.  I hadn't heard about this before and I was frankly a bit dubious about it given the press around dodgy home-testing kits.  However, the service is referred to expressly on the NSW Health website and they have a physical testing clinic, so I felt confident enough to give it a go.

The general time-line was as follows:

8am: Complete online questionnaire (medicare details must be provided).

9:15am: Receive call from Histopath informing me that a courier would text me with their ETA and instructions.

10:am: Receive foreshadowed SMS from courier.  I watch the instructional video.

10:30am: Courier arrives on time and leaves a testing kit at my front door. He tells me (from a distance) he'll wait around until I've finished and it should only take 5 minutes.

I conducted the test (nose and throat swab - not pleasant TBH!), packaged up the swabs and then placed it in the bucket left for me at my front door to be retrieved by the courier. I probably took something more like 10 minutes as I read the written instructions accompanying the kit in detail.

11am: Receive call from a doctor asking about symptoms and whether the courier had already attended.

Next day 1pm: negative result SMS received - phew!

I paid nothing for the service.

This is a great option for people who are able-bodied enough (and confident enough) to administer the test properly themselves but unable to reach a testing clinic. I also note all the material was in English, so may not be easy to follow for non-English speakers (although there was a video)."|sydney|2020|False|1
"I went for a covid test this afternoon, it was relatively easy and I wanted to share in case anyone was on the fence about getting tested - please do so.

This morning I had a headache, nasal congestion and fatigue and on/off sore throat which was only mild. I was still feeling crap by the afternoon so I rang the corona hotline (1800 020 080) and went through the symptoms checker. You can chose to speak to someone or just use the automated system. I used the automated system. At the end, it recommended I get tested and asked if I wanted a text message sent to me. The text came through immediately.

I looked up online where to get tested. I went to Randwick POW hospital which has a walk up clinic, no referral needed but you need to have symptoms or have a reason (ie close contact of confirmed case).

I went to the clinic, arrived around 4:20pm, there was a queue outside of about 10-12 people, everyone was socially distancing. Note you have to wear a mask when you go to get tested. While in the outside queue, a nurse gave us all a sheet about how to register for sms results. I registered in the queue. I then got a clipboard and pen to fill out my details, personal info, medicare no, regular doctor, symptoms, emergency contact etc. 

Some dip shit drove past the clinic and shouted at us all, 'you've all got corona', thanks mate, nice. 

I got to the head of the queue and went inside the building. I'd been waiting about 25 minutes by that stage. Sanitise hands. My temperature was taken via ear thermometer, blood pressure/heart rate via a finger clip. Then went inside and sat down waited for my name to be called, cute nurse said it should take approx 30 mins from then. They checked a few details about my name and my regular doctor and I'd missed a page about any medication or serious health issues. Filled that out. 

Then, my name got called. They did the finger clip checks again, confirmed my DOB and my answers, asked me what I did for work and if I'd been in any high risk areas (overseas, Melbourne, and a list of NSW hotspots). Then walked me to the swab queue. I waited 5 mins in the swab queue till it was my turn. 

Sat in the chair, the nurse pulls out the big swab. She said she was going to swab my throat and both nostrils.  Swabbed my throat, made me gag slightly, then did each nostril - nostrils not great, felt like when water goes up your nose at the pool, all tingly and eyes watered, but honestly only lasted a few seconds. It's the same swab for throat and nostrils so I joked I was glad they do the throat first. 

Then went to the front desk to get my paperwork. Paperwork includes a doctors certificate that covered 2 days including today, directions on self isolation and what to expect when you get results. They asked if I needed any masks but I said I was fine as I have some at home. And that's it, go home and isolate and wait for sms results which could be up to 72 hours.  End to end the whole process took just over an hour. 

The nurses were excellent, you could tell they were busy but were still very friendly, calm and reassuring to everyone. 

The biggest thing for me was feeling like a bit of a leper while on the queue outside on the main street and just the overall sense of being a sickly outcast. I think it's overwhelmingly better to feel like a leper for a short while and get tested for peace of mind and the overall health of our community. There was a doctor getting tested himself at the same time - he was chatting with all the nurses. It really is just a routine test that everyone should have if they are feeling even mildly unwell."|sydney|2020|True|1

The whole process was really easy too, it only took half an hour in and out, most of which was waiting in line (actual swab took like 2 minutes). It was free (even if you don't have medicare), they gave you masks, and they give you the results over text. 

Everyone should definitely get tested if you have symptoms! You might only need to isolate for like half a day, and it's the only way of preventing another outbreak."|sydney|2020|True|1

I’m somewhat new to Sydney (1 year) so I don’t have a GP so I searched up a place where you didn’t need a referral. 

I used the map at [NSW Health](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/clinics.aspx) and found a place where you could just text your name and time and fill in a form. 

Testing itself was very easy, they were ready for me as soon as I arrived and it all took less than a minute. They just shoved a swab in my throat and nose and voila. 

Drove home and hid out in my room, and got the text that I was negative before midnight (Was tested around midday).

For me I was planning on seeing a friend later and I was scared of passing something onto them. So now I’ll just see them next weekend instead when I’m better.

>Osterholm says. ""I liken it to trying to plant your petunias in the middle of a Category 5 hurricane.""

What he was actually saying was 

>Testing, contact tracing and isolation are the tactics being used successfully to crush outbreaks in countries such as South Korea and Germany. But those places never had the level of case surges that many U.S. states are now experiencing.

>""When you have something like this happening, there's no way that traditional testing and tracing is going to have any meaningful impact,"" Osterholm says. 

> At this point, there are just too many new infections occurring too quickly for underfunded, understaffed public health departments to effectively use testing and contract tracing, according to Dr. Jeffrey Engel, the senior adviser for the COVID-19 response for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

Futhermore, the Rep from Johns Hopkins stated

>""Given our basic failure to fix the gaps in testing and the bottlenecks, that really puts us on a path where there is no viable alternative beyond shutdowns,"" says Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

>Now, Nuzzo doesn't think all hope is lost. If enough people finally start wearing masks, and get vigilant about staying at least 6 feet away from other people, especially indoors, there may still be hope in at least some places of avoiding new shutdowns, she says.

When asked what would work, Osterholm says

>""We will not get there unless we bring this virus level down again. **And there's just no other way to do it literally but a kind of second lockdown,**"" he says. ""And this time let's get it right.""

As a younger adult in good health why should I care about wearing my mask anymore? I mean I wear my mask every second I'm out in public but literally no one else around me does. The stores I walk into say masks are required but the majority of people in them aren't wearing them and the employees greet them as they walk in and don't say shit about them not wearing a mask. Why should I give two shits about wearing mine? I'm not sick and I'm only wearing my mask to protect others from potentially catching the virus from me if I'm asymptomatic. But clearly none of them give a shit about protecting me .. fuck everybody.. and no i don't mean you guys b/c the majority of people on Reddit know how to use their brain unlike those who can't figure out that their caps lock is on when their password won't work|Ohio|2020|True|0
"Can the apartment manager have cars towed if their tags expired recently? 

The virus made it difficult for some people to renew their tags and from what I’ve researched the state of Ohio was extending expired tags. 

On the BMV website it states, “If a customer’s license, ID card, or vehicle registration (including plates and stickers) expired on or after March 9, 2020, the expiration date has been automatically extended until 90 days after Ohio's state of emergency ends or December 1, 2020, whichever comes first.”

Of course if it’s written in the lease that you will maintain current tags on the car I figured there might not be much that people can do about it? Even with BMVs having just been reopened to the public May 26, 2020."|Ohio|2020|True|0

"Hey all,

First thank you to the community as I've gotten most answers here and the 2 times I've spoken with anyone helpful it seems most everything is accurate. 

So I am turning to the reddit community for help here.

I had UI that exhausted and year ended late 2019...through alot of confusing weeks after I FINALLY found out that ANY help was available it was quite clear I should not go on PUA but back on UI instead. So my first call in the lady was helpful and said I did qualify for the extension because my benifit year end date and because I had correspondence about exactly that. She submitted over the phone for me...after many calls, hang ups etc nearly 30 days later she checked my file, saw no help, called back. So we filed the 13 weeks over the phone and I was under the impression all was good. Then they all changed to ""break in claim"" yet my balance updated and finally even a correspondence ""allowed"" (the UI claim was denied which I think that is supposed to be to go back to the 2019 end date?) Which that's sort of odd that it would allow, put a balance, then say break in claim. I know she said she needed a supervisor to fix it because she accidently missed a week and had to go back. 

The person I spoke to yesterday was helpful too and both say that even the 20 week extension applies in my case (no ""allowed"" letter though so we will see). I read that this needs staff intervention and also can mean pay was reported or over benifit or something to that effect, which that was why I called yesterday. I also emailed a help desk I've seen others here successful with. 

So my questions are with 13+ weeks now all showing as ""break in claim"", allowed EUC correspondence and all that the first question I have is is this happening because of the UI being denied? (I have time to appeal..or submit ""fact finding"" rather) is there any more I can do? I'm really at a loss here and frustrated that it seems only one employee can get actual movement to happen.

Also I should note that I am quite concerned that my likeness or information is out there somewhere as my laptop definitely has some sort of virus, malware or spyware and I cant say exactly for how long. I do have the fraud # etc...even though I cant say for sure if my likeness is being used should I briefly explain that in an email or call to that department as well? 

Extremely frustrated and just praying for some sort of movement because this is becoming ALOT owed (15 weeks) if counting the extra 600 and clearly have bills to pay. I've lost weight and am very skinny to begin with, constantly stress, and just dont know what else I can possibly even do. The reps hang up, promise a call back (which never happens aside one that wasnt promised) or simply put me back in the main menu to start over. 

Any help would be very much appreciated.  I emailed the owcms help desk I've seen referenced here. Praying this isnt even more of a waiting game!!"|Ohio|2020|True|0
We see what’s going on in the US. We are closely following the same trend on the charts as Arizona, cases went flat, and slowly started creeping up. I hear people stating that the death count isn’t high but let’s not forget. Deaths lag 2-3 weeks and you have to assume their is double the cases as testing isn’t that officiant right now. If we had rampant testing and contact traced throughout the US we probably wouldn’t be in this situation. Stating that, it’s to late now for the contact tracing as the virus has spread way to much. I wouldn’t oppose a stay at home order IF the government came up with a solution to hold people over until it cooled down. What is your opinion and how do you feel about what’s happening?|Ohio|2020|True|0
"I didn't get to watch it, but I caught the summary which is basically that outdoor visits will now be allowed at retirement/rest homes.

Seeing the cases rise rapidly in other states and seeing how few people are still taking safety procedures, I think its inevitable that the US is going to get rocked by covid in the next couple months. I can just imagine the cases absolutely skyrocketing in the fall and winter. And whether or not they do so consciously, I think everyone knows that and that is why the patios and beaches are packed with people trying to soak up the last bit of normalcy that we can expect to have for a white. 

I think today's press conference was DeWines very dry and clerical way of telling us to go and see your mom, dad, grandma, or grandpa, a time or two before the virus takes them.

I wish this was all some liberal conspiracy by Bill Gates to inject you with 5g, but it's real and its deadly and I fear that soon everyone will know someone who had it and didn't make it through. Or made it through with lasting damage.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have a bud light at the bar and ride the Millenium Force and not wear a face mask because I have a medical condition and masks suck all the oxygen out of the air and infect us with Obama sheeple."|Ohio|2020|True|0

I'm wearing a tie from Cuyahoga Community College today.

COVID-19 testing may now occur for anyone who wants one. Prior to this time we were in the mindset that these resources were scarce but we now believe that we have solved many of the previous issues. Our Minority Task Force will partner with community health centers and the National Guard to create pop-up testing centers where anyone can come to get tested. We'll increase the number and location of these sites as time goes on.

Places of worship have not been subject to closing. Most of them have chosen to do so however. They have done their services through digital means or by drive-through service. We have put together best practices for these places as people start going to the physical location again. These are a suggestion, not a requirement.

We've made a lot of progress in reopening the economy. There were around 35,000 new jobless claims last week. That is more than 200,000 less than we had on average throughout this crisis. Renewals of jobless claims have also decreased. 

The London Stock Exchange is now going to be located in Cleveland, Ohio. This will allow for increased capital for businesses within Ohio. Thirteen minority-owned businesses in Stark County will be some of the first to get access to that capital. This was a program that started before COVID-19 became such a large issue. 

ODJFS is getting a grant for training and a grant for helping Ohioans to get access to new jobs. These grants will be distributed at a local level. Prior to COVID-19, we saw dynamic changes to the economic situation and with COVID-19, many of these changes are moving at an increased rate, especially in regards to tele-health and similar improvements.

Ohio's Department of Health under Amy Acton focused on lead paint prevention and several other important issues. When COVID-19 appeared in China, her advice is what helped me and Ohio move forward to protect Ohioans. However, she has decided to step down. She will continue to advise me on health issues. I asked her to do this. I have asked Lance Himes to be her replacement. It is hard for me to put into words how grateful I am to Amy Acton. She will continue to focus on COVID-19 but look into public health work as well.

I never expected I'd get a job like this. When I did, I wanted to make Ohio a place where all Ohioans have the ability to get access to the care they need. Still, I'm only a representative of many people in Ohio. The entire Department of Health and especially Lance Himes were extremely important to me in everything I've done so far. I'm so grateful to have served with you. I'd also like to thank the State Highway Patrol for keeping everyone safe. I'd also like to thank the other cabinet directors for doing so much for Ohioans. Thank you to the Governor's team, including the Lieutenant Governor. Thank you to our media team and to the press. Finally, thank you to Governor Dewine and to Fran, for doing so much for me and serving Ohio however they can. 

To every Ohioan, I believe you have saved lives through all you have done. We're still going through this journey together, with all these challenges. Still, I believe it has allowed us to see things in a new light and created new opportunities to improve ourselves.

2:36 PM: Question Period Begins

The YouTube stream broke immediately at this point so I missed the first question.

2:38 PM: **Can you tell us where exactly Ohioans are getting sick? Bars? Churches? Work?**

Amy Acton: We've seen many different situations where people get sick. From the most high risk situation, such as in the hospital, to cases where we've seen no obvious way that people have been infected. Spending a long time in close proximity and not wearing a mask are heavy risk factors. The virus is still here and ready to infect us. You don't have to be perfect but everything you do will help keep everyone safe. 

Even when we take the best precautions, COVID-19 can still spread and it's important to remember that.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2:42 PM: **There has been a surge in many states, do you plan to show us if we're seeing a surge as you mentioned you would on Tuesday?**

Governor: Without intervention, COVID-19 will likely spread from one person to 2-3 people in general. Ohio's specific spread was a little less than 2 without intervention. On June 1st, it was slightly less than 1. We saw a slight increase in most of Ohio as time moved forward from May to June. The region surrounding Dayton is currently seeing a rate of 1.07, which is the most in the state. I intend to update this information as the weeks go on. I don't believe there's cause for alarm just yet but the numbers are certainly increasing. Mother's Day may have been a factor in these increases.

Amy Acton: We're looking at many factors throughout this time period. Many of these factors weren't tracked prior to this time. We're making advances and the ones working behind the scenes are excelling at their job. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:48 PM: **How did you feel about all of the negative attention you received during this time period? Is there anything you would change?**

Amy Acton: All of this was new for me. My focus has always been on protecting Ohioans. I had to focus on that. I hope that with me stepping down, I can more easily interact with people and hear their stories. I want to better understand where the dissent is coming from. 
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:51 PM: **What is the status of anti-body testing?**

Amy Acton: That testing is still underway. 1,200 people will volunteer to create a representative sample. One adult in every household will be eligible to volunteer. The hope is to have some of the data ready in July. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:52 PM: **Can you define contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and what will be voluntary or mandatory?**

Governor: I don't understand what you mean by this question. I'll have to look into it. Contact tracing has been going on forever. 

Amy Acton: Isolation is when you're ill and quarantine is for those who might be ill. Many of the laws on the books for diseases are from a long time ago. It will only be mandatory in extreme cases, where people are purposefully putting people at risk. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: **Why have you decided to leave your position at this point?**

Amy Acton: I've been trying to decide what to do for several months actually. We're certainly entering a new phase and I think this is a sort of natural shift for me to get a better focus. I think this will allow me to serve Ohio better.

2:05 PM: Stream hasn't started for me yet. And then it randomly did.

Governor: George Floyd's funeral began not to long ago. We're making efforts to improve our policing in our own state. My predecessor, John Kasich began this process. We're going to continue where he left off by looking into the use of lethal force and hiring practices. 79% of the US police force is already certified in meeting the minimum standards that were set forward while he was governor. While these standards are good, we are going to look into creating additional standards as necessary.

The most important aspect of policing right now is in regards to the policing of mass protests. Right now, we're looking to improve that sort of response. When physical violence of property damage is seen, police will still be empowered to do what is necessary to prevent further issues.

We're creating a new office of officer recruitment in order to work on improving diversity in our police force. 

These are all things I can do myself but many aspects of police reform will require the input of the legislative branch. This is only the beginning of what we plan to do. 

The state has distributed over 30 million pieces of PPE since this crisis began. Our focus is on local distribution. Ohio's Bureau of Worker's Compensation has been distributing PPE to businesses throughout the state. Our state institutions receive a 30 day supply of PPE. 

The supply chain is our major focus in this crisis. We're looking into getting better and more long-term partnerships with PPE producers in order to ensure we do not run low on PPE again.

We continue to learn things everyday about COVID-19. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 will never have symptoms. There is an important distinction between these cases and presymptomatic cases, where the virus has not spread enough to cause symptoms but will. Recent news has shown that asymptomatic cases will see less spread than was originally thought. Presymptomatic cases will still cause spread and that means that we need to continue increasing the amount of information we give out regarding the symptoms. Please remember to focus on social distancing, as the contagion spreads most easily in close spaces. 

I hope we'll continue to learn new things about COVID-19 everyday and improve our response as well.

2:29 PM: Question Period begins

**What is your opinion of the defunding of police organizations?**

Governor: I think defunding the police is an absurd concept. We need them to protect us. We definitely need to reform the system currently in place that causes the issues we're seeing but that will not include defunding the police as far as I know.
____________________________________________________________________________________
2:32 PM: **Will you use your power as Governor to make police organizations more transparent regarding use of force and officer misconduct? Could this involve a centralized database?**

Governor: I definitely believe we need police organizations to become more transparent in order to prevent future officer misconduct. I will be speaking with leaders of police forces in order to do what I can. There are many legal hurdles however.
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:35 PM: **There are studies that show the the diversification of the police force will have no major effect on officer misconduct. What else do you plan to do out side of that?**

Governor: I think that police forces ought to reflect the diversity of their communities. I've spoken about my other plans at length I believe.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:36 PM: **At what point will state employees be heading back to work outside of the home?**

Governor: We're planning on having people work from home whenever we can. We're recommending that all business that can have their employees work from home to do so, and we will not be hypocritical in following those recommendations.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:38 PM: **With so many police agencies refusing to follow earlier guidelines, should there be penalties for police agencies that do not follow your new standards?**

Governor: I think our focus on transparency will be good enough for now. I do want to say that I highly recommend that police agencies follow our standards and communicate with us. We'll be more aggressive if we see any flagrant issues.
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:41 PM: **It's been a month since we began reopening and there hasn't been a major spike. Why do you believe that is, have you spoken with the experts?**

Governor: The amount of people a single case will infect had dropped dramatically until recently. I will have a more educated person speak more on this on Thursday most likely. The Dayton area is seeing the highest increases in infection rates per case. Keep in mind that this is a lagging indicator. We're focusing on layered protection and adding things slowly. This is a constant work in progress. 
________________________________________________________________________________________
2:45 PM: **Do you intend to ensure that the legislature will support your police reform? Governor Kasich was unable to do much in that area. Is there fear that police unions will lobby against you?**

Governor: I will work on this. I've worked with the police as attorney general and I believe that certification and licensing processes will be something that we can get people to support. Policing is a profession and it should be treated as such, much like a doctor. I believe we can find common ground. I only announced the things I can do myself. I hope that citizens and police will work together in their communities to get reform themselves, even as we focus on this at a state level.
___________________________________________________________
2:49 PM: **Is your team still working towards getting over 20,000 tests done every day? Is this need increasing based on the protests?**

Governor: I am very concerned about the risk of infection found in the protests. I've seen the pictures. People aren't wearing masks and aren't social distancing. COVID-19 is not over. You don't want to spread that, especially to our most vulnerable citizens. 
_______________________________________________________________________________
2:51 PM: **Some of our community leaders feel like they have been ignored and that had they been listened to, that many of these issues could have been solved earlier. Will you be more willing to listen?**

Governor: I certainly understand the frustration that many have been feeling but I don't believe that we need to start over from the beginning. I hope to look into earlier recommendations and institute the reforms that we believe will be workable. I think all of us, citizens and police officers, will be better off after these reforms. I will keep pushing on this issue and get things done.
_________________________________________________________________
2:55 PM: **Don't you think we should be moving beyond minimum standards at this point? Is the NAACP and Black Lives Matter involved in this process?**

Governor: By minimum standards, I meant best practices. I invite anyone to speak to our public safety office if they have recommendations for our reform process. We definitely want to work with everyone we can.
_________________________________________________________________________________
2:57 PM: Based on how many are beginning to feel that police agencies are overfunded, do you think that there should be a reevaluation of police budgets?

Governor: Those decisions are made largely at a local level. Those reviews must be made at a local level. However, I believe that we should have been reviewing these things constantly and I hope Ohioans will begin to do so now. Every citizen should be focusing on the budget of their cities. We need to keep the funding balanced between the things we care about the most. We always ought to have a right to discuss and make change regarding that subject.

I would like to address a situation regarding an Ohio National Guard member. He was removed from his post after the FBI found white supremacist posts on his social media. We had sent 100 members of our National Guard to Washington DC. While I support freedom of speech, if we cannot trust our National Guard members to treat everyone equally, they should not be interacting with members of any community in that role. Following due process, they may be removed from the Ohio National Guard entirely. We are working with the Ohio National Guard to create a procedure in order to ensure that this never happens again.

We're going to be talking in more detail in the coming week regarding our plans on how to address the disparities we've found regarding health, especially relating to COVID-19. We will also address police reform. I want to make tangible changes to the way police officers do their jobs, and the accreditation process required to become one. We have to be ever-vigilant to keep them accountable.

We're still working on expanding our testing regimen. We are now allowing retailers to test with expanded testing criteria. There are currently 40 retail testing centers throughout Ohio.

We're working in the nursing homes, where the most vulnerable people in our population reside in. We're certainly not the only ones involved in this process. There's a vetting process regarding which nursing homes are most at risk, and who in each nursing home is most at risk. At that point, National Guard personnel will enter the nursing home and perform the tests. Each member of these teams are at least capable of performing the role of an EMT but many go even farther. We will work hard to increase the number of tests given out, not only at nursing homes.

There are still a few categories of businesses that have not been allowed to reopen. This has all been done in phases. We wanted to be able to make this a layered process, with the areas we felt were higher risk coming later. At this point we're still not totally sure how some of these openings will affect our data. The virus has not gone away and that was the main thought process behind our decisions. We need to move forward with caution as we continue to monitor the situation. The goal is to make every facet of a reopening as safe as it can be. 

To anyone who says that we should reopen with no additional requirements, you have to understand that doing that would make absolutely no credible sense. Doing something like that would be irresponsible as a public servant of Ohio, and a dereliction of my duty as Governor. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""These are no ordinary times."" You have the right to do things that impact only you, however when you can affect our most vulnerable citizens, you have to be held to certain standards.

The trends are largely moving down or staying steady. 443,533 tests have been completed in total. 5,636 of those who tested positive were health-care workers. 

We have to be more intentional with all of our actions. Keeping your mask on, maintaining social distancing, keeping things disinfected. Always think before you go and plan ahead.

2:40 PM: Question period starts

**With an upcoming golf tournament being allowed to open, what special requirements did they meet that others did not?**

Governor: We have not gone through the plans of other tournaments yet so there is no specific reason that other tournaments will not be able to reopen. 
___________________________________________________________________________________
2:41 PM: **What is your feeling about Trump's recent decision to fire tear-gas and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters in order to stage what some call a simple photo-op?**

Governor: I don't know all the facts but I've certainly seen some things on TV. I will not criticize the actions of the president at every opportunity, in the same way I won't criticize our mayors in Ohio. What I can say is that I have attempted to keep our response in Ohio balanced in regards to allowing peaceful protests, while preventing chaos. My focus is on Ohio first, and I have to say that our mayors have done an excellent job, and that our police have done a very good job, although they have made mistakes. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:45 PM: **What do you think of racism being considered a public health crisis?**

Governor: Race and prejudice has historically and continues to impact that health of many Ohioans. This is seen in the data. What we are focused on is taking action to ensure that these disparities are reduced, if not removed.
___________________________________________________________________________________
2:47 PM: **As an official, what is the plan to keep us united in these trying times?** (Couldn't quite catch all of it but I think I summarized it well)

Governor: I believe that America has important ideals but like all things on Earth, it is important. You have to try your best. You have to find a way to keep American ideals alive. We need to keep our police accountable. We need to expose the fact that African-Americans and Latinos are suffering far worse than some other ethnicity. That should be shocking. That should make us mad. But our response ought to be efficient and fair.

2:51 PM: Question Period ends

2:51 PM: The Governor begins speaking

I've mentioned a few times about my grandparents and my father, who planted trees despite knowing they'd never be able to see it grow to its full potential. All Ohioans must plant the seeds of success for future generations, despite this great tragedy. I hope that we can plant the seeds that will cause our disparities to change into positivity. We're constantly learning as we struggle to keep going. We want to ensure that every Ohioan, no matter their race, color, ethnicity, or gender, will have the same opportunities for success.

I, along with my family, have personally planted a tree in the Governor's Grove. It represents Ohio's collective hope and resilience. I expect it will live for 300 years. I hope you have a great weekend, I'll be here again on Tuesday.

I need help applying for unemployment.  Basically, I temporarily lost my job because of the virus and I have been struggling with the system ever since. I went to the website to create an account and I was prompted to create a question to remember my pin.  As soon as I did that, the website freaked out and sent me to the home page.  I tried again and the Ohio unemployment website told me that I already had an account.  I have seen websites do this in the past, so I decided I should try and reset my pin.  It said something was wrong and that I needed to call their number.  I keep calling the number and I keep getting a message that something is wrong and they can't help me.  If anyone has any advice, I would very much appreciate it, thank you.|Ohio|2020|True|0

I’m sorry if this is not the right place for this thread, but I was at the KC Zoo around the holidays and noticed this elephant. Not sure who it is! I couldn’t find any staff at the time and when I looked online I couldn’t find anything definite. Mostly research lead me to Zuri having a virus. Other than that nothing. It’s funny actually this elephant has been in many background shots at the zoo in many videos and at least one news video online. 

But nothing at all! 

I know elephants get problems with their joints but I’m not an expert so that’s why I’m asking.

i had adopted a cat from diva pets about a month ago. we were told that the cat we got needed to be around other cats. immediately when we brought him home we noticed he had a little cough & would throw up randomly. we thought it was weird but assumed it was just nerves. we kept our animals separated to keep nerves at bay, with the occasional small meeting with food. over the course of a couple days we noticed everything about the cat we adopted was polar opposite to what were told. it seemed like she was describing a different cat. eventually one of our resident cats was starting to have issues breathing and keeping water and food down. then she became anorexic and would refuse water. we took her to the vet after a couple days and they recommended we do a 24 hour hospitalization to get fluids in her. once we got her to the hospital, she was diagnosed with a virus. then our other resident cat started to show symptoms as well. we kept them in a room separated from the rest of the home to keep them comfortable. our resident cat that got it immediately was rapidly declining and we needed to put her down. i say all of this because when we tried to reach out to the foster, our messages were not going through. she had many cats in her possession and we didn’t see any of them expect for one. when adopting a cat please do your research and met all the cats in the rescue/shelter. all of the other cats in her possession have been exposed to the virus. please be wary and keep your babies safe.|KansasCity|2024|True|0
"Healthcare professionals feel free to elaborate but my December has been hell & hope to save people some time & headache. My college kid brought pink eye & a virus home to us at Thanksgiving (pneumonia is insane on her college campus rn). First got on an antibiotic 12/4. Typical cold turned sinus infection. Once I finished augmentin the sore throat hell began all through Christmas. I had originally tested negative for flu/covid/strep early December. COVID neg again at Christmas. I have never had strep in my life and had convinced myself I had esophageal cancer - it was THAT bad 24/7. The sinus symptoms had gone away but just felt “off” in addition to the throat.

Thursday the wait at KUmed campus urgent care was an hour minimum and was told worse at other locations. They said everyone is sick right now. Left & tried a NextCare location Friday which was even more insane. Left & went back to KUmed main campus & lucked out getting right in. Sure enough the sore throat is walking pneumonia which I have never had. They said it is everywhere rn. Stay well KC & please continue to help others get treated & prevent the spread!"|KansasCity|2024|True|1

"Personal note:  My absolute go-to app is Radarscope.  It shows you storm and tornado tracks and isn't bloated with bullshit like weather channel and weather underground.  

Also, I've been negative on TV meteorologists in the past but when the tornadoes came through a few weeks ago in Florence, Jason Simpson on WHNT did an incredible job at identifying subtle locations.  He added more value than any app could.  

Stay safe from basically the earth today (virus, weather) and happy Easter.

**3:30 PM UPDATE**

SPC just issued Tornado Watch #109 for north & central AL + south-central TN until 10:00 pm.  It is NOT a PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) watch.

SPC wording in the watch calls for ""Several tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes likely.  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80 mph likely Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible""

Watch probability table indicates 80% chance of 2 or more tornadoes and 70% chance of 1 or more EF2+ tornadoes in the watch area.

Clusters of strong/severe cells (some tornado warned) getting ready to push into central AL from MS.  Other storms further north in northwestern AL not strong or severe at this time.

Warm front has not yet pushed north into north AL.  Will watch to see what it does.

Situation remains conducive for severe weather across the TN valley.  Stay weather alert!

**11 AM UPDATE:**

""All ingredients continue to come together for significant, widespread severe weather today across much of the southeastern US.

A PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) tornado watch was just issued for north & central MS, right up to the MS/AL state line.  SPC indicates 90% chance of two or more tornadoes, 80% chance of one or more EF2 or
higher tornadoes within the watch area.  You can guess who will be next for a tornado watch . . .

SPC did nudge their “moderate risk” area further north to near the TN/AL state line in their 8:00 am convective outlook.  Will watch closely to see how they may adjust the forecast in their 11:30 am update.

Will continue to monitor the northward progression of the warm front. That is likely the key to just how serious things will get this afternoon and evening.

Expect the TN valley to be under a tornado watch later today, perhaps as early as this afternoon.  Recommend attention to NWS forecast and local media forecast throughout the day today.

This remains an evolving situation, so the forecast could change either for better or worse.  Hopefully the worst of the severe weather will remain to our south & southwest.  However at this time, today looks likely to be a day where everyone will want to stay very weather alert.

""A significant, widespread severe weather potential will exist today (Sunday 04/12) across much of the  Southeastern US.  Areas most likely to see the worst of the severe weather include northern LA, most of MS, and north & central AL.  All surrounding areas (including AR/TN/GA and the FL panhandle) will have severe weather potential as well, perhaps not as concentrated as the areas mentioned above.""

**EARLY AM UPDATE**

Things still look as though there will be a good chance of widespread severe weather across north AL/south-central TN.  *All modes of severe weather continue to appear possible, including severe thunderstorms with damaging winds (60+ mph), large hail (1+”), flooding rainfall (2” – 3” with 3"" - 5"" possible in some areas), and tornadoes.  Some strong/violent long-track tornadoes may be possible as well.*

SPC still has NOT moved their “moderate risk” area any closer to the TN valley - right along the TN river.  While not exactly comforting, this does suggest that areas to our south and southwest will see the worst of the severe weather.  That does not mean that the TN valley will escape unscathed, just that we (hopefully) will not see things quite as bad as
they could be.

The real ""wild card"" in the scenario today is the warm front, currently to our south.  If it pushes through during the afternoon hours, then we will be in the warm air, highly sheared sector for much of the afternoon. This will give ample opportunity for severe storms and supercells to form.  As is usually the case, any cells that form out ahead of a line
of storms will likely be capable of the worst weather.

If on the other hand, the warm front delays its passage or stalls out completely south of the area, then our severe weather potential will be significantly diminished.  Expect scattered showers/thundershowers this morning.  If that persists into the afternoon hours & temperatures do not rise too much, then perhaps we will not see that much severe weather.
However if that warm front does push through and we get into that warm unstable air, well you can imagine the possibilities . . .

Expect the TN valley to be under a tornado watch later today, perhaps as early as this afternoon.  Recommend attention to NWS forecast and local media forecast throughout the day today.

*This remains an evolving situation*, so the forecast could change either for better or worse.  Hopefully the worst of the severe weather will remain to our south & southwest.  However at this time, today looks likely to be a day where everyone will want to stay very weather alert."""|HuntsvilleAlabama|2020|True|0

"This seems like an obvious idea, but so far I haven't encountered it personally. Basically, a voter obtains a blank ballot for their precinct and marks it before going to the polling location, where they cast the ballot. This avoids any concerns re mail-in voting and fraud. But in addition, it should drastically reduce the amount of time each voter spends inside the polling location, so that a.) the voter's risk of exposure is significantly reduced (depending of course on one's understanding of how the virus spreads) and b.) voters spend far less time waiting in line, despite the reduced number of locations.

The only reason I can think of why we couldn't do this is that it violates our election law, in which case I'd feel better were somebody to explain how and why.

"The [state dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ece0db09da4d4ca68252c3967aa1e9dd) (screenshot attached) has a nice bar graph that might allow some to more easily grok the trends than a color coded calendar.

For visualizing positive tests, which is considered by some to be a more leading indicator, [worldometer's](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/nebraska/) *Daily New Cases* chart is another good one to bookmark.  That same page also has a *Daily New Deaths* chart that could show if changes in advanced treatment are having real impact.

I love seeing all these numbers go down.

"I know this is crazy /s, don’t have these large gatherings. COVID numbers are crazy high! And guess what?? Masks work!! We have had 4 positive employees at work in the last 2 months Guess what? All were linked to family. None got it from work. Why? Masks, sanitizing, and social distancing. 

NO method is fool proof, yes you can still get it when all parties are wearing a mask but your odds are ALOT lower! 

This isn’t rocket science, most cases are being contact traced to family gatherings, bars, and restaurants. Why?? Because of prolong exposure without masks and without adequate distancing. 

You have to be cautious but this virus does not have legs and cannot get up and travel to your neighbors house. Mask wearing, limiting time around people, and always keeping atleast 6 feet are PROVEN to dramatically reduce spread. 

I’ve seen it at my own work place. Each person from my work who had it did not spread it to anyone else at work. Of course we may have gotten lucky but I believe masks and social distancing, as well as quick quarantine the moment symptoms arose made all the difference

EDIT: From one of my nurse friends working on the covid floor, all patients are currently 50+ and youngest she’s seen was 40. No this doesn’t mean if you’re under 40 you’re in the clear and certainly doesn’t negate your responsibility to those over 50. This virus is scary to many in their 20s and down right terrifying to many over 50! Be a good human, think of others, your night out at the bar can wait if it means possibly helping out a higher risk person!

"Wear a mask. It’s why healthcare workers wear masks. To fall in line?? What about when you can’t express your first amendment because of tear gas and pepper balls, isn’t that a better depiction of making people fall in line? 

I really struggle to understand this one. Is it like a slippery slope thing, where you are worried what’s next if you required to wear a mask? I mean, if you’re within 200 miles of a border, which equates to 2/3 of the country, the government can have check points and stop your car to see if there’s anyone undocumented in your car. About a decade ago, SCOTUS ruled that it was constitutional for an innocent person to be strip searched at the jail as part of getting arrested in a ticket mix up where the cop was looking at outdated data and mistakenly thought the guy had a warrant out for his arrest. And who can forget TSA who says they can naked body scan you and/or grab your genitals if you want to fly. There are way bigger liberty issues than wearing a mask to curb the spread. And scientists change as new facts and data comes out. Do you read a science book and say “huh I wonder what they thought 6 months before they figured this out? Must all be equally bad information I guess if they revised anything.” Aren’t you more worried about the government and foreign countries using data from fb and other places we store our info for nefarious purposes? I get the distrust of authority in general but man, there are way bigger fish to fry and I hear crickets outside of the mask stuff. 

Masks don’t hurt anyone, and it’s a fact it slows the spread. Doctors, experts and healthcare workers are begging us to wear them, so isn’t it possible the anti-mask movement is probably propaganda meant to divide us and keep the virus alive and well? If you wanted to cripple and divide a country so it fights itself from within, all while avoiding any blame, because you wanted to destabilize the US, what better way than what’s happening right now? People don’t even share the same facts. The way we are being systematically divided and the deaths were experiencing is more harmful than a bomb drop, especially because most people don’t even realize we’re under attack, and they’re defending the groups trying to divide us. The Cold War never ended, and we’re seeing the long game play out. The only way authoritarian countries can rise is not by doing better on their own, but by lowering their enemies to their already low level.

"&#x200B;

Dear Nebraskans,

I am a critical care physician taking care of COVID-19 patients in Omaha, NE.  I have been tracking the COVID situation in Nebraska very closely since February.  This letter explains our current situation and what we can do to improve it.

**Short version:  The COVID-19 outbreak in our state is extremely severe, and the only way we can improve this is for everyone to get very serious about social distancing.**

The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska is gravely concerning.  The 7-day rolling averages are very bad and getting worse.  Nebraska has 641 new cases per million per day.  Douglas County has 548 new cases per million per day.  These are among the worst rates of new cases in the United States.  Every week, our county and our state set new records for new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.  All parts of the state, and indeed the entire region, are in a similar situation.  

A large rise in case counts is always followed a few weeks later by a large rise in deaths caused by COVID.  Nebraska is starting to experience this reality, and the trends indicate that the situation will get much worse in the weeks to come.  In September and early October, the number of deaths in Nebraska was fairly steady at about 25 per week.  Two weeks ago this spiked to 44.  Last week Nebraska had 55 deaths.  This upward trend will continue.

Nebraska has 698 COVID-positive people in the hospital – exactly one month ago we had 271 (a record at that time).  The Omaha Metro has 303 COVID-positive inpatients – exactly one month ago we had 125. These numbers rise every day.  Hospitals in Omaha and throughout Nebraska can and will fill up without a drastic change in the trends.  Operating hospitals above normal capacity impacts the care of all conditions, not just COVID-19.  When ICUs are full, there are no beds for the next victim of an asthma attack, stroke or heart attack.  And when these patients are stuck in crowded emergency departments, the ability to deliver optimal care is hampered.

Many people have noted the low case fatality rate in Nebraska.  One of the main reasons for this low case fatality rate is the fact that while our hospitals have been under strain, they have never been overwhelmed.  If Nebraska’s hospitals become overwhelmed, the case fatality rate will go up swiftly.  We know this from analyzing the fatality rates in other parts of the United States and the world.  

While we have made progress in understanding how to best treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19, this progress is only applicable in the event that we maintain adequate capacity to care for sick patients.  In response to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, hospital leaders are implementing plans to increase capacity throughout the state.  These plans are necessary, but having physical space for patients does not solve the problem.  Temporary traveling healthcare workers will help to provide care in these additional spaces, but these workers are not unlimited in number.  Hospitals all over the United States are hiring them to address the same conundrum.

You may have read that hospitals in Nebraska have ample capacity to handle a large increase in new cases.  I disagree with this statement.  Here is how you can find out for yourself.  Ask a physician, a nurse, and/or a respiratory therapist who works in one of the largest hospitals in your area, “How are you doing in terms of census and capacity?  Do you think your hospital can handle a large increase in COVID admissions?”  I know how they will answer because I ask colleagues these questions regularly.

**The best way to limit the devastating effects of this COVID-19 surge is to interrupt the transmission of the virus.  Reducing the number of new cases will require a dramatic change in behavior.**  We have learned from other nations how to keep transmission rates low.  In order to prevent many unnecessary deaths, we need to dramatically change the way we are conducting our lives.  The actions are very simple.  We must avoid crowded places, closed spaces (especially with poor ventilation), and close contact with non-household members.  We must avoid the “Three C’s” all of the time.  We must wear our masks, watch our distance, and wash/sanitize our hands.  We must do the “Three W’s” all of the time outside of our own homes.  We need to stop gathering.

I will define “gathering” as:  people spending time together, indoors, with people from outside their own household, for non-essential activities.  When people gather, they (1) put themselves at risk for contracting the virus, and (2) risk passing the virus to others.  Put bluntly, when people gather they contribute to the outbreak.

Here are some examples of gatherings that are contributing to the spread of the virus:

\-	Multiple (more than one) families getting together indoors for meals or parties

\-	Dining inside of a restaurant, especially if it is crowded

\-	Spending time inside a bar, especially if it is crowded

\-	Indoor group sports.  Example:  playing basketball indoors with non-household members is a perfect mechanism for spreading the virus.

\-	Working out at a gym, especially if crowded

\-	Attending events with non-household members.  Example:  attending a crowded wedding reception, particularly indoors and without masks, is a perfect way to contract and transmit the virus.

While avoiding some of these gatherings might sound drastic, these sacrifices are mild compared with the suffering and deaths our state will experience without a change in behaviors.  Many people say that they have a “bubble” which consists of multiple families whom they trust because of their excellent social distancing.  Gathering with multiple people from outside your own household is the opposite of social distancing.  Such gatherings are contributing to the increased cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

If you and your family have eased up on your social distancing, as most people have, now is the time to revert back to how you did it in April.  Every time you forego a group gathering, know that you are saving a Nebraskan’s life.  Yes, it is that dire.

Please keep in mind that asymptomatic spread is extremely common.  This means that ANY person, even without any signs of illness, can transmit the disease to you and your family members.  This is why we must maintain distance between ourselves and non-household members all of the time.

Children get infected and transmit the virus – there is undeniable scientific evidence for this now.  Thankfully, few children get very sick.  Still, when asymptomatic children are not socially distanced, they spread the virus to other children, who eventually transmit the virus to vulnerable people (of all ages).  Those vulnerable people are at the highest risk for severe disease or death.

Herd immunity without a vaccine is not possible.  If the United States tries to pursue herd immunity without a vaccine, millions of Americans will die from COVID.  This is not acceptable.

Masks help to prevent spread, but they are not magical.  Being outdoors reduces risk, but this is not magical either.  Yes, wear a mask.  Yes, do things outdoors instead of indoors.  Still, the best way to eliminate risk is to not be near other people for non-essential activities.

People in our communities have a choice right now.  We can continue on the current trajectory, which will be catastrophic, or we can choose to engage in real social distancing and save hundreds if not thousands of Nebraskans’ lives.  The sooner we get this outbreak under control, the sooner we can get back to a more normal way of life.

"Unfortunately, after more than two years, I tested positive for COVID with antigen test today. My symptoms are considered mild but nonetheless I went to urgent care center to seek treatment. However, Patient First doesn’t treat COVID and doesn’t prescribe Pfizer pills. Went to another urgent care center that does prescribe Pfizer pills, but with impossible conditions to be eligible, i.e. unless you are terminally ill. 

This is so freaking different from what the CDC and State Health Department have said about the experience and expectations. The drug is not in back order by any sense anymore so why the doctors and clinics are so adamantly refusing to prescribe it? I made an appointment with CVS Minute Clinic on Monday but I have no idea if they would do anything, despite they say they offer COVID treatment option. 

For anyone who has gotten the Pfizer pills, it’s greatly appreciated if you can disclose where and how you got them. Thanks."|Maryland|2022|True|1
"Evening all!

This week I cut my vacation in hot springs short after my hotel room was entered/scoped and we discovered the was valet driving our car- all this for the privilege of paying over $300 per night on bathhouse row.

I'm greatly conflicted because of all the potential I saw in Hot Springs: along with the beauty it seems the place is soured by an unsavory underbelly. I've heard, and certainly believe, there's a meth problem (no place is immune, I get it), but it seems to me there's much more to the story then that and I'm curious to learn more about what's preventing Hot Springs from thriving.

I couldn't help but notice the large number of derelict/abandoned buildings (with the medical arts building standing foremost in my mind), and this implies a bigger story. What role does the local and state government have to play in all this? What is it that's keeping investors away? Are there any particular entities (be in government or business) that are benefiting from suppressing economic development? Or is it the local population themselves (as gentrification isn't good news for everyone) standing in the way? Is the crime problem part of the problem or a symptom of a different issue?"|arkansas|2021|True|0

✨be me, moved from NYC to KC 7 years ago

✨allergies? sure, heard of em. stuffy nose once a year for a week, bada bing bada boom

✨people complain about severe allergies in KC over the years, thank goodness that ain't me

✨come back from a catering event Monday night

✨the fastest wave of starting to feel symptoms ever: sore throat, stuffy nose, extreme body/headache, feeling hot and cold, extreme fatigue 

✨i deteriorated FAST. bedridden and huge efforts to move around and talk the next day. I've had COVID before and this is almost worse 

✨yay the walk-in clinic has a spot at 4pm! i can barely drag myself to the bus to get there

✨tests: strep is negative, COVID is negative, flu is negative, perfect temperature even tho i feel heavy-headed and so warm. my throat is indeed swollen though.

✨doctor: ok I'm gonna send you home with allergy pills and nose spray. the fluids from your stuffy nose drain into your throat and cause the soreness/swollenness.

✨me: ....you mean to tell me ..ALLERGIES kicked my ass this hard?? they can do that?? is this what allergy life is for other ppl??

✨doctor: yep! we have the absolute worst allergens around here. welcome to the Midwest.

"I know this is crazy /s, don’t have these large gatherings. COVID numbers are crazy high! And guess what?? Masks work!! We have had 4 positive employees at work in the last 2 months Guess what? All were linked to family. None got it from work. Why? Masks, sanitizing, and social distancing. 

NO method is fool proof, yes you can still get it when all parties are wearing a mask but your odds are ALOT lower! 

This isn’t rocket science, most cases are being contact traced to family gatherings, bars, and restaurants. Why?? Because of prolong exposure without masks and without adequate distancing. 

You have to be cautious but this virus does not have legs and cannot get up and travel to your neighbors house. Mask wearing, limiting time around people, and always keeping atleast 6 feet are PROVEN to dramatically reduce spread. 

I’ve seen it at my own work place. Each person from my work who had it did not spread it to anyone else at work. Of course we may have gotten lucky but I believe masks and social distancing, as well as quick quarantine the moment symptoms arose made all the difference

EDIT: From one of my nurse friends working on the covid floor, all patients are currently 50+ and youngest she’s seen was 40. No this doesn’t mean if you’re under 40 you’re in the clear and certainly doesn’t negate your responsibility to those over 50. This virus is scary to many in their 20s and down right terrifying to many over 50! Be a good human, think of others, your night out at the bar can wait if it means possibly helping out a higher risk person! If we are lucky we will be over 50 one day and I’m damn sure we wouldn’t want some 20 something spreading the next plague to us because they’re not worried about it. 

Also it seems many over 50 are the least concerned about it. Just crazy to me. I have told my mom we are NOT going to thanksgiving this year. She said there’s nothing to worry about you’re buying into the panic. I’m thinking come on my risk is LOW for this virus and I’m taking it seriously, you’re damn near 60 and not in perfect health, how are you not being cautious!"|Omaha|2020|True|1
"Hey there Denver,

I would actually like a bit of advice regarding my current employment situation. I moved to Colorado within the last half of a year and got a job at a restaurant chain and was self quarantined due to family showing many symptoms of covid 19 and now I believe I have it as well. The restaurant is still open due to the carry out and delivery options they offer. The corporate office has emphasized with voluntary quarantine however offers no benefits to employees unless you have proof that you have contracted the virus yourself (not including family members). I am currently awaiting the test results and have filed for unemployment due to not working for nearly two weeks now but won't be able to take advantage of that until the end of April (I'm assuming due to high volume of people applying). I have contacted my direct manager and was basically brushed off like I was just leaving to get out of work and the manager made it seem like me being such a burden was not worth the time or effort to deal with and it was impliedthat my job may not be there when I am fit to work again. Do you all have any advice for me regarding this?"|Denver|2020|True|1
"I am a pharmacy technician, and I have been feeling slightly off this last weekend. I finally had a day off on Saturday and slept all day which is highly unlikely me.

Now I’m beginning to feel feverish and I’m experiencing horrible body pains and shortness of breath. I’m aware that these are all serious symptoms and that I work in health care and need to take care of myself. 

My employer requires a doctor’s note in order for me to receive sick pay. I’m in my early 20s, new to Colorado, and do not have insurance yet from my current employer. I don’t have a recent PCP because my normal PCP was under my university, and I graduated so I no longer can receive care from them.

"I work at a mall in the area and my store is one of the only ones still open despite it not being an essential business whatsoever. A few days ago I developed a cough and some cold like symptoms and decided to go home. Today was my next scheduled day and things haven’t gotten any better for me so I decided to call in again. I couldn’t help but sense some frustration from the manager. 

Now I’m feeling guilty but I don’t think I should have to feel this way. I’m not going because I care about myself and my coworkers and don’t want to get anyone sick ( I work with a lot of older people and if I were to have a virus it could potentially kill them). I don’t feel good about taking that risk at all. I also don’t have health insurance. I’m sure everyone is aware of the current situation but I’m just looking for some support. 

I don’t think it’s fair to me or my coworkers that I even have to make that decision. I could potentially be putting everyone at risk but it seems like no one cares about that at all. All similar stores have been shut down for a week or more at this point and have given their employees paid leave. I’m not looking for a handout, and based on every other similar store’s response to this situation, it doesn’t seem right that we’re still open. I don’t think my company can afford to do anything for their employees so that’s where I’m at. 

Am I making the right decision? I mean, is that even a question I need to ask? It just sucks because it seems like this isn’t being taken seriously at all by my employer. I don’t want to put anyone at risk and I constantly hear that I should be staying at home if I’m sick. I don’t want to lose my job over this but I don’t feel comfortable being around that many other people. Is anyone else in a similar situation? What are you doing about it?

Update: We shut down after the statewide order. I’m not receiving anything from the company but I will be ok financially. They really hung us out to dry lol. Thanks for all your support and helpful perspectives!"|Denver|2020|True|1

"If anyone here has been tested yet can you please share your experience? 

I believe I need to be tested and since everything is a shit show I was looking to see if anyone had any experiences yet that they could share.

I know most people won’t qualify to be tested (especially since the new testing guidelines go into effect today) but after reading the CDHPE website I believe I do. I work in a Dental office in South Denver, I work in the mouths of 10-15 patients a day. Lots of our patients are elderly so if I have it we need to know so the office can shut down and contact all patients I’ve been in contact with the last week. 

I’m just trying to get a picture of what I’m in for if I go over to that drive in test lab. I also read that some private providers will be able to test starting today, but I didn’t know any info on who/where those other providers are.

Edit: Yes I am aware I can’t just drive over, I’m waiting for my PCP to open.

Edit2: Spoke with my PCP, she said they’ve been told that there won’t be anymore testing done on the general public. That only those hospitalized will be given tests, since they’re so short on them.

"This morning on the way to work I was listening to a country station from northern CO. One of the DJs starts talking about a lecture that experts gave at Harvard about the coronavirus. 

He starts off by saying that he is just some dumb guy from CSU so who is he to question the experts? Well... exactly. You aren't an expert. Normally I don't agree with the stay in your lane argument because everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in the case of a public health emergency, if you don't know what you are talking about then you should just shut the hell up. Giving out misleading or wrong information can get people killed.

Then he starts his rant on the main points that the experts made. The first being that the US health care system was not well prepared for this. However he knows people in the county health department and they have been working for months on this so they are prepared. Does he also know that it took over a month longer for the CDC to developed a test for coronavirus than most of the world? That one of the reasons that the number of reported cases is so low in the US is because they couldn't test for it? Just because they knew about it and were making plans does not mean that the US was as prepared as they should have been.

The second point the experts made was that it is no longer possible to prevent the virus from coming here and that trying to contain should be the priority. He actually agreed with the fact that it was already here, but then went on about how we don't need to close down schools or anything yet. That is the same policy that has been taken in countries like Italy. The problem is that people become sick and contagious before they really start showing symptoms or getting checked. That is why it is spreading so fast. Waiting until 1 person is diagnosed before reacting means that now a group of people are infected with it instead of just 1 person.

There were other things he went on about, but at this point I couldn't believe someone could be this ignorant and speak with such authority to such a large audience. His cohost was just agreeing with every thing he said and adding to his authority. She didn't offer a single counter point or try and add any balance to it. She was just a yes man. If you aren't an expert in communicable diseases then just shut up and let the experts talk. Spreading misinformation is bad enough, but contradicting experts and making fun of them because they are speaking at a prestigious university is just dangerous. This is why anti-vaxxers exist.

"**THE TL;DR STORY**     
In particular, I’m looking for someone with experience in this area to resolve what would most likely be a motherboard issue with the console. I’m guessing it needs what’s called a “Reflow of the board” or “Re-Balling”. It’s showing symptoms of the Yellow Light Of Death’ (YLOD). I prefer someone who takes emails so I can share a detailed report of the issue before they offer me a quote. Appreciate any recommendations in advanced!

**BACKSTORY**     
Happened over a month ago that my PS3 stopped working. I did a web search and found Beetronix Solutions in NSW does these repairs. On their website here (https://www.beetronix.com.au/gaming-consoles/ps3-ylod.html) it says they stopped offering repairs for this type of issue, *however*, when I called them up a guy told me they still do those repairs for over $200.

The problem is… I emailed Beetronix Solutions with a detailed report into my issue and asked for a written quote. They didn’t respond. The guy I spoke with over the phone (same guy who told me the price and that they can fix it) had a shit awful phone manner and flat out told me they are too busy to answer emails! It’s this reason why I’m heavily reluctant to pack my console and ship it to a different state… I don’t want to do that to be later told either:

**a)** It actually cannot be fixed, or that service isn’t offered.     
**b)** End up charging me something else besides what was verbally said over the phone or what is listed on the website (the website is pretty simple so the information might be out of date).

"Hi, fellow Melbournians,

Not sure if this is the right place to post this. Please be gentle with me, and redirect me to a more appropriate sub if you know of one. Also, I’d like to apologise in advance for the infodump.

I am a 29-year-old cis woman based in the eastern suburbs. I’ve struggled with mental illness for most of my life, but I have been consistently misdiagnosed since I was a teenager. Finally, at age 26, after being assessed by a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist, my former diagnoses of BPD and BPII were revoked, and I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, as well as MDD and GAD.

Like a lot of other women who are diagnosed with ADHD as adults, it quickly became apparent once I started taking stimulants that I also have ASD, but my ADHD symptoms had been masking it all along.

This last year has been a rollercoaster for me in terms of figuring out my identity, not only as a neurodivergent person, but in terms of my sexuality and relationship style—I finally came out as pansexual, and I discovered that I am polyam. Getting to know the real me has been a deeply liberating experience, but it has also been exhausting, and, over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been struggling badly with autistic burnout. I have been exhausted, and extremely emotionally dysregulated.

I have been seeing an excellent clinical psychologist over the last five years who specialises in ACT/schema therapy, which has been immensely helpful, particularly in relation to processing my childhood trauma (I grew up in an abusive household). Nevertheless, it’s becoming increasingly clear to me that my current psychologist is not equipped to counsel somebody with complex neurodivergence, nor somebody on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum who has multiple partners. This isn’t a criticism of her as a person, or as a mental health practitioner—it’s just that she is a straight, monogamous, allistic person, and I am struggling more and more to relate to her.

Which brings me to my question. I am looking for a neurodiversity-affirming psychologist, preferably one who specialises in ASD/ADHD, and who has experience working with queer/polyam people. I would prefer somebody who has lived experience in these areas, but it’s not mandatory. I’m wondering if any of you wonderful people would be able to recommend somebody in the greater Melbourne area who fits these criterium? I understand that what I’m looking for is quite niche, so I’m happy to travel, if necessary.

I saw the Austin few times and their follow up with my GP and level of care was honestly horrible, and they were prepared to diagnose me without ever giving me a single Holter Monitor test or other actual diagnostic test at all. They also prescribed me a medication that made me really sick and my follow up appointment after being prescribed the medication just never happened on the scheduled day. Not to mention the second Holter monitor test I had through the clinic Dr Chris practices through took months to send anything at all to my GP, although I didn't see him directly. 


I tried to see someone privately last year only to receive a voicemail from their receptionist that due to demand they were ""no longer seeing POTS patients"" despite having some atypical symptoms that might be something else. I require an assessment and letter from a cardiologist specifically to send to VicRoads to get clearance to get a learner's permit.

"I am absolutely desperate to find a doctor that can help me with my issues in Melbourne or Australia in general. I have suffered from stomache issues and allergies my entire life. In 2023 I decided to go on a restrictive diet to find out exactly what I was allergic to. Ends up I cant eat ANYTHING and all my symptoms got WORSE. 

I have eaten Steak and Potato every day, 2 to 3 times a day for over a year and anything i introduce gives me a reaction ranging from constipation or upset stomache but the worst is getting close to anaphalactic 'hayfever' like symptoms. 

These 'hayfever' symptoms are getting worse to the point of anaphalxys, my last reaction had me struggling to breathe and my eyes puffy. This is from anything containing histamine. Worst reactions happened when i ate smoked aged Pork or citrus (lemon). The symptoms are being close to life threatening and without an epipen or allergy plan I could face a deadly attack. 

I have asked for a referal from my doctor 4 times now to see an allergy specialist and some of these places wouldnt take me, didnt do digestion related problems and the doctor doesnt know who can help me.

I rang monash health, they never returned my call. Epworth isnt taking adult patients. Most places only do skin testing. Ive previously seen gastroenterologists who couldnt help. 

I saw a dietician who helped with suppliments and I feel better at the moment but still remain on a restrictive diet.

"Evening all!

This week I cut my vacation in hot springs short after my hotel room was entered/scoped and we discovered the was valet driving our car- all this for the privilege of paying over $300 per night on bathhouse row.

I'm greatly conflicted because of all the potential I saw in Hot Springs: along with the beauty it seems the place is soured by an unsavory underbelly. I've heard, and certainly believe, there's a meth problem (no place is immune, I get it), but it seems to me there's much more to the story then that and I'm curious to learn more about what's preventing Hot Springs from thriving.

I couldn't help but notice the large number of derelict/abandoned buildings (with the medical arts building standing foremost in my mind), and this implies a bigger story. What role does the local and state government have to play in all this? What is it that's keeping investors away? Are there any particular entities (be in government or business) that are benefiting from suppressing economic development? Or is it the local population themselves (as gentrification isn't good news for everyone) standing in the way? Is the crime problem part of the problem or a symptom of a different issue?"|arkansas|2021|True|0

"2 months ago, I went on vacation to Brevard County, Florida for 6 days. Now, one of my favorite Floridian activities is bird watching, and sandhill cranes are my all-time favorite Floridian bird. However, the entire 6 days I was in Florida, I only saw 5 sandhill cranes. My dad saw another one at a golf course, but I wasn't with him. There are hundreds of sandhill cranes in Brevard County, so I don't get it! Why did I have such a hard time finding them? Every other trip i've taken to Florida, I saw way more of them. Don't get me wrong. I'm grateful to have seen any at all. I would've gone home incredibly disappointed if I didn't see any at all.

The Floridian bird I saw the most of during my trip was definitely ibises, which is another one of my favorites. I saw at least 100 of those! I also saw lots of egrets, herons and even pelicans. I'm just confused on where all the sandhill cranes were when I was there! Where were they? I had really looked forward to seeing sandhill cranes! Was it because I went during bird flu season? Maybe it being bird flu season had something to do with it."|Florida|2022|True|0
"Exalted Governor,

I’m a proud lifelong resident of Ohio. Until thirteen months ago I was happy living, working, playing, and volunteering here. Ohio is my home.

Today I saw news that you are considering shifting the metric for lifting restrictions from Covid cases to Covid vaccines administered. 

I will forgo the obvious criticisms:

* Of moving the goalposts for the hundredth time; 
* Of hysterically fearing a single risk, while increasing myriad other risks trying to fight it;
* Of fixating on the short-term for some Ohioans instead of the long-term for all Ohioans; 
* Of assuming we want or need your permission to live our lives;
* Of implicitly claiming ownership of our bodies;
* Of assuming we are too stupid to see any of this;

No, today I’m writing to you as a man who has reached his limit. For over a year I watched silently as you caved to the demands of petty authoritarians. What you fail to understand is that you are exercising power you do not rightfully possess. You and Dr. Acton were happy to assume the mantle of omnipotent protectors – as long as the only threat was a virus not so different from the cold or flu. 

How did you fight this enemy? By declaring overnight that many of our rights must be suspended indefinitely. Rights that have conditions are not rights, but privileges. Somehow you retain the audacity to hold Ohio hostage until we capitulate to more of your ever-escalating demands? 

If you move forward with this absurd ultimatum, I will leave Ohio by the end of 2021, permanently. I will never again live or work here, and when I visit I’ll try my best to spend as little time and money here as possible. 

We see the sleight of hand you are attempting. First, you verbally encourage use of these experimental vaccines while offering no tangible incentives to recipients. No respite from mask mandates, social distancing, or lockdowns. Then, you act surprised that “not enough” people are getting the shot.  Finally, you declare that we just might have our lives back – if only we reach one last arbitrary benchmark. 

We see how desperately you cling to emergency powers, choosing which metrics to use so the emergency can never officially end.

Governor, I wish you will experience in your remaining years a mere fraction of that which you have thrust upon my statesmen and me. I wish you will feel the isolation, the dullness, the confusion, the hopelessness, the resentment. I wish you come to understand that you willingly traded Ohio’s physical, emotional, spiritual, and financial health for the promise of saving a few lives which were close to their end anyway.  I wish you realize the juice was not worth the squeeze. That you did a thousand times more harm to us than if you had done nothing at all.

I wish you live to see that history will be cruel to the petty tyrants of 2020 such as yourself.

It’s not all bad though, Mike. You have at least one thing to look forward to. When you pass on to the next life, you won’t have to endure any more bitter Midwest winters. 

You’ll be where it’s always warm."|Ohio|2021|True|0
"Hello all,

Does Anyone have info on this year's flu/ stomach flu around Indy?

 Sons daycare has been hit with flu symptoms that seem to be severe for about 12 hours and then gone, no fever. Daughters school has also been hit (against small window, no fever). 

Now my wife has it, no fever, just puking. Almost like a food poisoning or ""stomach flu"".

Symptoms appear to literally be just puke, then gone. No body aches, no sniffles. No temp. No bathroom issues, just vomit it seems and maybe tiredness.

"So I just had the most awkward encounter with my local pharmacist. Woke up with a sore throat and a bit lethargic. Went to get some codral original. They took my licence, punched it in and said 'we can't sell you that because you bought it yesterday'. 'no I didnt'. 'we can see it on the register. You used your licence to buy it yesterday.'

The last time I bought codral or equivalent would be at least 6months ago, probably more like a year. I told them there was an error and I think this is identity theft, but they just kept saying 'sorry we can't sell it to you.' I was like 'no no, I don't care about the codral, I care that someone has used my licence number to buy this'. 

It was really awful. I was there wondering what to do about identity theft and they were looking at me like I was a junky trying to convince them to give me a few pills. 

Anyway, I have called the police, they want me to come in for a statement, but they said I  can't do it until I don't have 'cold and flu symptoms'. Can't do it over the phone or internet. Could be days later.

Any advice appreciated. Am I at risk of other things from stolen licence info? I travelled for work yesterday, so have flights and purchases that prove I was in a certain location, which is unlikely to be wherever the purchase was made. I just can't fathom why it is so hard for the police to just take a statement over the phone or at least start something, especially given the whole covid situation."|sydney|2021|True|0

"I’m not a conspirator and this post isn’t partisan. 

I’m looking at current trends in covid cases and as of this morning (8/17/21) the current 7 day average rate of new cases in NJ is 1537.

New York’s current 7 day average is 4,554.5 

Last year at this same week, the average for New Jersey was 270.5. And the average for New York was 609. 

Both states, and the entire country, saw a steady increase in new cases and deaths continuing into late October of 2020 and then a huge increase was reported through winter peaking around January 5th for NJ with that week averaging 12,966 new cases, and 16,611 new cases averaged in NY.

What I’m saying is that we are averaging much higher rates of new infections than this time last year and we’re again about to enter cold and flu season where in new cases and deaths will undeniably rise. Are we to expect higher infection and death rates this season than last year? 

I looked at death rates too. Currently NJ’s weekly average is 7 deaths. NY is 18. This time last year NJ reported 0 deaths, but that number rose quickly in Fall. New York’s weekly death average as reported on 8/18/20 was 3, and that number rose as well.

Our numbers are higher than they were last year and so I’m wondering if we’re headed for an even worse flu season this year.

"I just telephoned Optimal Pharmacy+ Jamison to make an appointment to receive an influenza vaccine. I have a medical condition that renders me eligible to receive this free of charge under the National Immunisation Program (NIP). 

The pharmacist told me it would still cost me $25.00 despite the Government and the Pharmacy Guild saying it is free - see below. She said that pharmacies do not participate in the NIP and so could charge an ""administration"" fee. 

If pharmacies are going to charge a fee, even for those eligible for the NIP, then the pharmacy should say so up front and the Guild should be clear about this on its www site. Or is this pharmacy running a scam?

I tried emailing and phoning the pharmacy Guild to clarify, but they are a very elusive bunch. However, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia states, ""If you're eligible, you can get the influenza vaccine for free under the National Immunisation Program (NIP)."".

"The United States, and especially states like Florida, have done awfully bad in the pandemic, mostly for a reason: lack of cooperation.

Nobody knows how long this pandemic could last. The virus may stay with us permanently and vaccine trials may fail continuously, and living like we are doing now may last the entire new decade. So changes to how we live are unavoidable and if you don’t understand that then it is going to eventually hit you, being you or a close one who fall to the potentially deadly disease.

You need to wear your face mask. Studies are clear. Places where people use it in public keep hospitalizations rates stable. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT- keeping hospitals with sufficient beds and ICU’s, and especially ventilators, since Covid-19 is not the only disease and the are still deadlier diseases out there. Understand that you may be feeling alright but can still be carrying the virus. When you breathe freely you exhale the airborne virus. IT IS AN AIRBORNE VIRUS even if the WHO hesitates to accept it. Whenever you are with another person or group of people that DO NOT LIVE WITH YOU, you NEED to wear it. This includes your friends, extended family, neighbors, coworkers. No exceptions and no excuses. Use an effective lightweight mask if you have to use it for a while. This means that you need to get away from others and do things via phone, internet, video calls or whatever for extended periods of conversation with others. 

You need to stay away, 6 ft or more. The more the better. Especially in places like the beach. No sure if this is the best time to go with friends out since a distance of 6 ft and the use of mask would be ideal in this situation, but if you feel an uncontrollable need to hang out with friends please keep a distance between each other.

Do things as much as possible outdoors. A/C recirculates the air and thus, the virus. Why are people being infected in the middle of the hot summer? Because first the virus needs a temperature of 133 F to completely disintegrate instantaneously so it has plenty of time to get to you if you are 6 inches from another person without a mask and second because most people are getting infected indoors at bars, bowling alleys, restaurants and the such where the temperature is comfortable for the virus to hang and recirculate until it reaches you face openings. Therefore avoid unnecessary indoor activities and businesses should change their model to outdoor, open spaces and avoid walled areas.

Closure and an order to stay at home are the other option which is not economically viable.

The pandemic does not seem to be getting over anytime soon. And flu season approaches so it will be really bad soon if you insist on wanting to go back to the old times. The old times are over. Face it and make the necessary changes so you don’t end up dead, killing a loved one, or having to go to bankruptcy or losing your home because of the millionaire debt you will owe the hospital."|Florida|2020|True|0

And before I start getting down-voted, and people reply with silly arguments about death rates, and odds and this and that.

Ask yourself if you can afford a two week hospital stay and countless follow up medical bills if you're lucky enough to only require to be treated and not be placed on a ventilator. 

Don't be an idiot and gamble on a slim chance of somehow being asymptomatic. 

Wear a mask when you do go outside, but do not be fooled into thinking that makes you safe to do as you please. You're merely lowering the chances of passing it on to someone else. 

Our government has shown us that it cannot be relied to protect us in this crisis. It is on US. 

A haircut isn't worth continued spread, hospitalization, or even death whether to you or someone you love, or even a stranger. 

A drink at a bar isn't worth it.

A theme park isn't worth it.

A meal at a restaurant isn't worth it. 

Seeing your friends isn't worth it. 

Visiting your elderly parents or grandparents right now ISN'T WORTH IT. 

&#x200B;

Quite frankly reopening our economy at the cost of unnecessary human suffering has proven to not be worth it. 

We're right back where we started people, and for what? Are any of you better off or in better shape to weather this wave or the next? 

As a business owner are you ready to shut down again because we rushed to reopen, instead of demanding our government get its shit together and focus on small business and regular folk instead of Fortune 500 corporations?

If you're not ready to shut down now, are you ready to shut down in the fall when we run into the Flu and people potentially getting hit with both viruses at once?

What happens when all the government aid expires in July for those who need it the most? 

Get your head out of the sand, you can't ignore this just like you can't ignore a category 5 hurricane smacking into the state. 

Which by the way, please have a plan ready should you need to evacuate and be met with other states mandating you be quarantined because our state failed to get it's shit together before we opened.

You need to wear your face mask. Studies are clear. Places where people use it in public keep hospitalizations rates stable. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT- keeping hospitals with sufficient beds and ICU’s, and especially ventilators, since Covid-19 is not the only disease and the are still deadlier diseases out there. Understand that you may be feeling alright but can still be carrying the virus. When you breathe freely you exhale the airborne virus. IT IS AN AIRBORNE VIRUS even if the WHO hesitates to accept it. Whenever you are with another person or group of people that DO NOT LIVE WITH YOU, you NEED to wear it. This includes your friends, extended family, neighbors, coworkers. No exceptions and no excuses. Use an effective lightweight mask if you have to use it for a while. This means that you need to get away from others and do things via phone, internet, video calls or whatever for extended periods of conversation with others. 

You need to stay away, 6 ft or more. The more the better. Especially in places like the beach. No sure if this is the best time to go with friends out since a distance of 6 ft and the use of mask would be ideal in this situation, but if you feel an uncontrollable need to hang out with friends please keep a distance between each other.

Do things as much as possible outdoors. A/C recirculates the air and thus, the virus. Why are people being infected in the middle of the hot summer? Because first the virus needs a temperature of 133 F to completely disintegrate instantaneously so it has plenty of time to get to you if you are 6 inches from another person without a mask and second because most people are getting infected indoors at bars, bowling alleys, restaurants and the such where the temperature is comfortable for the virus to hang and recirculate until it reaches you face openings. Therefore avoid unnecessary indoor activities and businesses should change their model to outdoor, open spaces and avoid walled areas.

Closure and an order to stay at home are the other option which is not economically viable.

The pandemic does not seem to be getting over anytime soon. And flu season approaches so it will be really bad soon if you insist on wanting to go back to the old times. The old times are over. Face it and make the necessary changes so you don’t end up dead, killing a loved one, or having to go to bankruptcy or losing your home because of the millionaire debt you will owe the hospital."|Florida|2020|True|0

Hi! I’m not new to the PNW so born and raised and shaped by the chronic mold and dampness up here lol but I did just move into an older building (early 1900s) that isn’t well maintained and have been super ill ever since.

Then, as I was house sitting this week, I noticed the cough cleared up. Now I’m back home, full of goo, and noticing my cat has been coughing as well!

From the most read newspaper in Florida. USE PRIVATE WINDOW OR INCOGNITO TO READ IF A PROBLEM

Governor needs to close all nonessential businesses and people need to stay in their homes. My wife and I started prepping in early February and have been at home exclusively for over 3 weeks.  Did go for a nice drive yesterday but did not get out of car.

Florida is 3rd largest state but has not followed lead of NY and CA.  This will be a disaster within a week.  FL needs a governor like Cuomo  or Newsome who are very proactive.  This is not a political issue or even a 2 week ordeal.  For many Floridians it is a matter of life or death or having irreversible lung damage. It affects the older persons and even the  invincible younger ones. This is not the flu  but rather a horrible disease.

Publix and Trader Joe's are not permitting checkout people to wear gloves or masks because it will make customers scared.  Are they kidding.  Checkout people see hundreds of customers a day and  handle cash and  groceries.  China was burning cash to stop the spread of the virus.   When we run out of food in several months we will have to figure out how to resupply.  Maybe Amazon will still be shipping then."|Florida|2020|True|0
"[NEW: As requested, a [downloadable PDF](https://docdro.id/30e3nnc) version of this document is now available to send to relatives]

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [300,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)). Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

* [Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/) with regards to this section.

#**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China.)

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking](https://twitter.com/kr3at/status/1240296333354950658?s=19)/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx)). Quitting now [can save your life](https://coronawiki.org/page/covid-19-the-role-of-smoking-cessation-during-respiratory-virus-epidemics).

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

* **UPDATE:** March 18th: ""99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says"" ( [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkq6vz/99_of_those_who_died_from_virus_had_other_illness/) )

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds)).

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w). March 17th update: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" (Source [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)). March 20th update: Latest genome analysis seems to suggest two viruses may have combined ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-origins-genome-analysis-covid19-data-science-bats-pangolins/))

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), which will be kept up to date (as will any PSA I posted myself, as long as it's still on the main page of your sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

Anyone know where I can go to see if I HAD the virus at some point? I don’t want a test to see if I currently have it.

"Hi guys I messed up big time having unprotected sex with a potential positive partner. Encounter was about three weeks ago and the anxiety is really starting to take over now. Without being specific I work in an industry where this can be a potential career ender which is unfortunate given how advanced treatment is now. My original plan was to wait 3 months for a more accurate OraQuick home test then a subsequent lab test following but I am honestly not sure I can contain myself to wait that long as I have had incredibly mild but also very common early HIV symptoms at the three week mark.

Based on the CDC website it would appear that confidential testing would mean my results would still be shared with the state etc and with my personal information could find its way into a database or something which I am trying to avoid until I can figure things out. Are there any testing centers that can get me a ""early"" result that don't require identifying information and forms to be filled out?

For the record I do not plan on having sex with anyone anytime soon especially unprotected as this encounter and the seriousness has in a way traumatized me a bit.  Currently just trying to figure out if my fears are even confirmed and if they are what I can next to prepare prior to having it on record. :(

&#x200B;

EDIT: I know this comes across as selfish and I guess in some ways it is. Why do I need it to be a secret? I can't go into super specifics due to paranoia but all I can say is the career in question poses ZERO way of me transferring it to anyone. I don't do any medical field things, no blood exposure, no sex (if it wasnt obvious), etc.. Treatment is the potential deal breaker not HIV itself. Sounds backwards doesn't it... not that it is good reasoning but the only risk is my own health by not taking action. It's a hard pill to swallow and I wish I could go back in time and drill that into my head and maybe I would have been able to save myself this post. The amount of fear this has given me makes me very much not interested in potentially passing this on to someone else. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, that is not my intention with this post. Thanks for the replies. Hopefully I can find peace."|phoenix|2023|True|0

A little background - I am considered high risk due to Lupus/Autoimmune issues. I have been experiencing some gnsrly symptoms and was referred to get tested by my PCP and Hartford Healthcare phone screening. It took 3 days to get an appointment for testing and Midstate was the quickest one to get into. I was dreading the nasal testing after seeing/reading so much online. When I drove up today, it was a simple throat swab (like you would do for Strep throat). I'm a little confused....as I thought the nasal test was necessary and the accurate way to be tested. Does anyone have any more information on this? I can't seem to find much info online besides articles saying it should be both nasal and throat.|Connecticut|2020|True|0
"I’m amazed daily at things I see on the internet each day.. and things I see out my own window as I’m sitting isolated to keep me safe and others.

But frozen food you can keep that longer than fresh foods. But bags of pasta, rice , cans of tuna. Do we all want nice steaks and burgers fresh meat and veggies Dailey yes. However they don’t last more than a week and you’ll need to go back. The point is to limit you and other to exposures you may or may not have. It’s not about eatting  gourmet night it’s having something to eat to make it by

-brew your own coffee.  Dunkin’ Donuts should not have lines daily. I would drink two dd coffees a day haven’t had one in two weeks miss it greatly. However  made to order coffee is a luxury not essential.   The kid at that drive thru sees how many people Daily is he virus free was everyone he sees. Or is it being passed along all day.

"I'm looking for good GP recs for Brisbane, because I'm going off my rocker! I've been ill for MONTHS.

I have had strep throat / tonsillitis since February, my regular GP just wants to throw increasingly powerful antibiotics at it to the point I'm functioning at half capacity from fatigue while the infection isn't worse or better.

I went to another doctor today to try and get a referral to a specialist. She got very defensive when I said I had seen another doctor and already had a diagnosis. She angrily told me ""she was a great doctor"", (I had said nothing to suggest otherwise, I was literally describing my symptoms), and then said ""you've picked a great day for this"" because it's Sunday before ANZAC day. She refused to send me to a specialist and prescribed tests I've already gotten to tell me what I already know. This isn't the first time something like this has happened.

I'm in a kafkaesque sisyphean nightmare and I want OUT. PLEASE.

Is there ANY GP in Brisbane that doesn't mind referring someone who isn't getting better to a specialist. I just want a doctor who doesn't think me SEEKING HELP for a medical condition is an INSULT to their DOCTORING ABILITIES or whatever.

"Hi all,
I have been eating inordinate amounts of spinach lately (at least half a small bag every day, if not more). I have also received an email from Coles stating their records show I purchased an affected product.

I experienced a range of symptoms (Minor slurring of speech, dry mouth and skin, flushed face, heart racing, among others. No delirious episodes that I'm aware of).

Maybe I'm being a hypochondriac, but I am concerned. I plan to go see a doctor to get checked out for peace of mind. 

My main question is this: I've already consumed the spinach and thrown out the packages. Am I still entitled to a refund? Is there a body I should report my experience to in case there are longer term consequences?

" I  (22F) am definitely long overdue to see one, but a bit apprehensive  since all my previous experiences with psychologists were... Not good.

My  #1 choice would be someone who can see me via telehealth, since I  actually live a few hours out of Melbourne. I understand that this may  not be possible, so I'm also open to suggestions for people in the CBD  or along the Gippsland line (Pakkie, Dandenong, Clayton, Caulfield etc)  who I can travel to. I'm looking for people who are currently accepting  new patients, which I know rules out a lot already.

I'm  looking for someone who's experienced with female ASD and ADHD. Would  strongly prefer someone who's experienced working with young adults. Not  expecting to find someone experienced specifically with cult-related  trauma, but someone who works with emotional abuse or something is  probably close enough.

I find it  very off-putting when psychologists try to dive into a very rigid  approach (such as immediately making me choose whether I want to do CBT  or DBT, when I mention having symptoms of anxiety). I guess I'd probably  rather have someone with whom I can talk everything out with.

I'd prefer someone who's friendly/warm, but also a good psychologist. Bulk-billing would be a cherry on top, but not necessary.

"As the situation is inevitably worsening, I would like to share some of our views and the Chinese side of the story. I feel like the media is not really sharing much about the situation other than numbers and how people are being isolated for treatment, so I hope this provides some insight.

(Furthermore, I would like to voice some of my personal thoughts on the situation below as well.)

A little about me:

I’m currently a uni student here at UniMelb, and I’ve lived here in Australia since I was very young, so I would like to say I’m pretty familiar with Australian culture. I’m very attached to Chinese culture as well, and my girlfriend is currently in China and is coming back to resume uni (btw, not from Wuhan).

**The coronavirus, how did this happen?**

I’m definitely not any medical expert, but from Chinese sources and Weibo (our Twitter), it seems to be: Bats, wildlife, people dumb enough to eat them without any precaution.

Please. Don’t suddenly get this misconception that us Chinese are bat-eating monsters. The majority of us eat the same meats as you do (while quite a lot do like eating organ meats, it’s still the same animals), with the rare few that like to take it to the extreme.

For the Aussie-equivalent, we all eat poultry, beef, pork and seafood, some like to experiment the kangaroo and crocodile. And then pops out this guy who boils this kookaburra or fries a wombat. This is “the guy” we’re talking about, who started this.  (only for illustrative purposes)

**All the Chinese are suddenly wearing facemasks, are they sick?**

The whole point of this disease that is making this situation horrific, is that for the first few days or more (don’t credit me on this, refer to medical sources), we don’t know. The symptoms only show after being infected, and by that time you can’t even count how many people you’ve spread it to.

A few points that I hope are clear:

If we haven’t returned to China during this Lunar New Year, we most likely have been staying in Australia prior to the virus. Most of us should be fine.

We are worried about the people who have returned after the virus outbreak, and before the airport checks and government putting more attention to the situation.

We are wearing masks to protect ourselves from others, while at the same time not wanting to infect others if we do have the virus and symptoms haven’t shown.

(Please don’t be rude and make fun of the face masks. It’s happened during the last few days and this is one of my motivations of making this post.)

We encourage you all to take some precautions on this as well, Chinese or non-Chinese.

**Is it rude to stay at a distance to the Chinese right now?**

While I’m in no place to represent everyone and it really depends on each situation, I personally wouldn’t mind it.

As long as we all stay respectful and don’t make rude comments and weird looks, we’re fine. Hell, we’re staying distances from each other, not to mention others.

In all seriousness, if a Chinese is close to you that is coughing without a mask, leave, get cleaned up and take disinfection precautions.

**What do we think of the situation?**

We are more infuriated than anyone about this situation right now. The timing could not be any worse. Everyone’s hyped up for our New Year’s celebrations, everyone’s anticipating for the huge movies that are coming out, everyone’s shopping for gifts and decorations.

All of a sudden, we’re encouraged to stay home, transportation services have closed down, and the hit movies have all been withdrawn until further notice.

(Side story: A popular actor/director Zheng Xu has released his movie completely free online to support the situation and encourage everyone to stay home. Sure, there are sponsorships and deals and stuff, the box office would’ve still been much more than that. What a lad.)

Imagine all of Melbourne being ready for New Years, then suddenly the fireworks are cancelled, all the bars and restaurants and shops have been told to close, and all are encouraged to stay home. Same deal.

Especially for the people in Wuhan, who have no idea that there are people eating bats, and have probably planned travels after New Year’s. They are now completely locked in the city. It’s pretty much like the Simpsons where that dome is on Springfield, but now it’s happening for real. Not to mention all the doctors, nurses and others who are risking their lives and giving up their time with family for New Year’s to stop the virus.

People are pissed, people are ranting all over Weibo about why people are eating bats (or not taking any precautions for eating them), people are praying for their family and Wuhan to get better soon.

**What’s going to happen now?**

Well the virus outbreak has already begun and it’s most likely going to get worse. A main reason is that the governments reaction times are arguably slow. (However, I do understand that it would be very controversial to take any large-scale action in China at an early stage during the Lunar New Year Period, and Australia is too busy sorting out the fires. But the main focus of this post isn’t about any politics or backstory, so I won’t go any more into that.)

China’s going on full power to stop the virus (to put this in perspective, a 1000-patient hospital is getting built, in 6 days). Vaccines are getting looked into, from professionals in both China and other countries around the world. I guess another positive note for us Australians, is that most viruses are much weaker in hotter temperatures, so the situation would most likely be resolved in a few months.

Thanks for reading up to this point. I hope this has given you an insight on our side of the story. As the situation is directly pointing at the Chinese, I really hope that the situation is more transparent and there are no conflicts and miscommunications about this. Please share this to other social platforms and friends so more people can understand our view on the virus.

Thanks again,

a Chinese student who loves Melbourne.

" Yesterday, while I was driving through Canby, Oregon, a police car behind me turned on their lights. I assumed they were trying to cut through traffic to pursue someone else, so I moved to the middle crossing lane. But then I realized they were pulling me over. He asked me to pull over to the right and I complied. 

The officer asked me to move to the right side, and I did. When he approached my car, he asked me why I had stopped in the middle lane. I told him that I had an anxiety disorder and ADHD, and I was scared, so I stopped in the nearest lane. The officer then explained that I was being pulled over for distracted driving, as part of a routine traffic stop program.

He mentioned that my car smelled like marijuana and asked if I had taken any drugs. I told him that I was on Adderall (prescription) and Wellbutrin(also prescription), and that I had taken my second dose of Adderall 10-15 minutes prior. I also told him that I had smoked in my car and eaten an edible about 11 hours earlier.

The officer asked me to take a field test, which I did. My balance was off, but I told him that I had sciatica and could provide medical documentation. He also noticed that my pupils were very dilated , but that was because of my medication. 

Eventually, I was arrested for DUII and released after giving a urine sample and taking a breathalyzer test, as well as doing another set of tests. The officer told me that he believed I was high due to my eye dilation and rapid heart rate. However, most of these ""symptoms"" were just side effects of my medication. I was completely compliant and coherent throughout the entire process, but now I'm facing a DUI charge.

I don't have the funds for a lawyer, but this charge might damage my ability to get into college and receive financial aid. I don't know what to do, but any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated."|Portland|2024|True|0
"My partner and I have suddenly developed cold symptoms  yesterday which then worsened very fast over the course of one day and night. We suspect it to be covid but no testing clinics nearby are open, we don’t have cars to go to further ones and also don’t want to risk passing it to other people on public transport. 

We can’t do phone consultations with our regular GP since last time we had a face to face appointment was more than 12 months ago. Most medical clinics I looked up also have the same policy where those who haven’t had an in person consultations at their practice (including new patients) can’t book in for an over the phone consultation.

Even when the nearby testing clinic opens tomorrow and we do get tested, we still wouldn’t be able to book for a GP visit until we receive a negative result, which will take a while (or worse receive a positive result and not being able to book one at all). 

We are not very familiar with the healthcare system here and neither of us have families in Sydney. My partner is having a pretty bad fever and I don’t know how to get access to a doctor, I feel so helpless. And I’ve been having trouble sleeping for days so I don’t think I’m in my clearest mind to make decisions and finding solutions. 

Please if anyone knows how to get access to a GP in this scenario please please let me know. I don’t know what to do.

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your replies! My partner‘s fever has done down a bit for now (39℃ To 37.8℃). And I was able to fall sleep for a little bit so I’m not as much on edge anymore and can think a bit straighter now.  

My partner and I decided that, as many of you have suggested, we shouldn’t be going into shops looking for the testing kits if we are suspected be infectious. We’ve managed to find someone who is able to drop their extra test kits for us later today. And we’ll go in to the nearest testing clinic first thing tomorrow morning to get tested. 

We still couldn’t get access to a GP but we are going to try calling some of the numbers you guys provided. For now we are kind of withholding on the idea of going to ER: our symptoms are not bad enough, if we are negative going in will increase our risk of getting covid, if we are positive going in will increase other people’s risk of getting covid. So we’ll leave this option until our condition worsens to the point that we have to."|sydney|2021|True|1

Been isolating in a room at the farm house and was going to get tested yesterday but by the time my partner got home the testing clinic was closed.  I am double vaccinated (pfizer).  Been off work since Wednesday and still not feeling any better.    
  
Now I think is the time to see a doctor to find out what's wrong with me.  I don't believe it is covid as I have not left the farm in about 2 weeks but I will get tested just in case.   
  
I know back at home there is walk in clinics in almost every small town and city across the county that you can show up to without a booking. I think I'm safe to assume it's not the same here.     
  
If anyone can give me the lowdown that would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you"|sydney|2021|True|0
Tested negative the other day but today all of a sudden I have a fever and am coughing and really need to know if I have Covid or something else. I tried cvs to no avail but I know there are other healthcare providers giving tests, if anyone can help I'd be so grateful! Thanks!|Indianapolis|2020|True|1
Roommate has sore throat, fever, chills, no taste as of this morning. Unsure if exposed. We live together and he was sent home because of these symptoms. I told my job and they said still come in since i don’t have symptoms right now. Isn’t that wrong? Given what we’ve been told...|Indianapolis|2020|True|1
"My wife and I are both exhibiting symptoms.  I'd call them on the high side of mild---we're both fairly miserable but safe and quarantined.  Breathing is pretty decent, but some shortness of breath.  We're achy, exhausted, and running a low grade fever.  Neither of us has lost our sense of taste or smell.

Can't seem to schedule a test because we're not passing the screening process.  The our local health department DOES have testing  (we're in Hamilton county) but the next available appointment is November 30, which I'm sure it'll be all passed by then.  

&#x200B;

Just curious if anyone else is ill, but running into difficulty being tested because you're not ill enough?"|Indianapolis|2020|True|1
"Heya Brisbane, so I've woken up at 3:45am with a fever that's rising fairly quickly and I had plans later on today. 

Any remedies to kick this thing in the butt, besides panadol/nurofen? 

Does ""breaking a sweat"" still work? 

Thanks 😊"|brisbane|2017|True|1
"[I don't know how to make text bold or italicised yet but this is taken from the article].

""A TEENAGE resident of a student college at the University of Queensland's St Lucia campus in Brisbane's west has tested positive to meningococcal disease.

Close contacts of the 18-year-old woman have been given antibiotics to help reduce the risk of the bacteria being transmitted further.

The infection, described as ""severe, but uncommon"", is difficult to contract without close and prolonged contact with someone who has the bacteria.

Although most people with the bacteria remain well, they can spread the germ to others, who may develop symptoms. At any given time, meningococcal bacteria are carried harmlessly at the back of the throat or in the nose in about 10 per cent of the community.

Infection occurs when meningococcal bacteria invade the body from the throat or nose.

Symptoms can include a high fever, vomiting, fatigue, joint pain, a stiff neck and a purple rash that spreads quickly.

So far this year in Queensland, 37 patients have tested positive to meningococcal disease, compared with 45 for the whole of last year."""|brisbane|2017|True|0
"Around May 15th I'm making a move from Chicago to NC due to a lot of life changes recently (heartbreak, coronavirus uncertainty). After 13 years in Chicago, I've decided to move all my things to storage for the time being, load my motorcycle with some camping gear, and ride south to stay with family. 

I know it's a strange time to be going on a road trip, but it'll save me money, keep me socially isolated, and it'll be a welcome dose of freedom in this cabin-fever time.

I'll be coming the route through Columbus OH, down 35, to 64, to 77. Once I'm in WV I'd love to find spots to camp, and country highways to make the ride more fun. 

I'll have a simple tarp and hammock setup. I'm hoping state parks will be open by May 15th, which would make finding a camp site a lot easier, but who knows. I can always stay at a hotel in a pinch, but I'd like to avoid it.

I'd love advice from locals on how to find the best spots to camp (or areas to avoid), or some specific sites along the way to check out (or drives to enjoy). Really any suggestions or insight would be greatly appreciated.

Can't wait to see your beautiful state! Hope you all are safe and healthy in this strange new world."|WestVirginia|2020|True|0

I was hiking Runyon this morning with my dogs. It was incredibly windy and very, very dusty. I'd never heard about Valley Fever until reading some comments under the Palisades fire postings. And now I'm worried. So... anybody suspect they got Valley Fever from hiking the hills in LA?|LosAngeles|2024|False|0
"I’ve heard from family in the Midwest and friends on the East Coast having a nasty bug that causes congestion, nausea and even vertigo. My boyfriend is currently sick as all heck with congestion, cough, slight body aches / chills but with NO fever and has consistently tested negative for COVID with the at-home tests.

Does anyone else have something similar? I know it’s likely a seasonal virus but am curious. I am showing no symptoms (have a pretty strong immune system in general) but we’re both isolating for the next 2 weeks. "|LosAngeles|2024|True|1
