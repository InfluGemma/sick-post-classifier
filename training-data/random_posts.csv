"Visiting Boston. Two days ago, someone sideswiped my vehicle in traffic and took off. Filed report w/ BPD. Provided license info and vehicle description. Spoke with my claims adjuster yesterday. They found the vehicle in an insurance database from the license# and confirmed my description. They also told me that the owner lives in Boston.

What do you think are the chances that BPD will do anything about this?",0

What‚Äôs a good place for oil painting classes in Boston? I was looking at the MFA ones and they look great but they don‚Äôt seem to work with oil that much. Do you have any recs? Perhaps some less known classes/instructors?,0

"We‚Äôre looking for suggestions on when to visit and area to stay in. It‚Äôll be my first time although I‚Äôve visited (for work) most of Massachusetts so this is strictly a Boston trip. 

October or November? If downtown is out of our price range for hotel/airbnb, any other area that‚Äôs convenient with public transportation? Feel free to add things we must do. Thinking it‚Äôll be a Friday to Monday trip. Thank you! ",0

"Moving from NYC/Manhattan. Looking for a 1 bedroom, currently narrowed down to 30 Dalton St and Hub50House. 

I'll be affiliated with MIT, so I will spend a lot of time in the Cambridge area - and the distance to MIT matters to an extent for me. But, it appears both options are relatively equal (\~40 mins walk, 10 mins drive).

Want to hear your opinion on the neighborhoods, the quality of the building, etc. Hub50 goes for around 4.2k/month, while 30 Dalton is 5.2k/month.  ",0
"Hello everyone.

  
The Queen Mary 2 will be arriving in Boston on July 4th, and I want to take some pictures of it, since it has the special status of being the world's last oceanliner. I was thinking of either going to the Summer St Bridge that's on the opposite end of the Flynn Terminal, or go to Castle Island and take pictures there. However, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations that could be better. For reference, I have a 200 mm zoom lens, so distance is not a huge problem. Thanks.",0
"This year has been phenomenally quiet on the fireworks front.

It‚Äôs got me wondering, kind of like the Hot Waitress Index (which suggests that in a weak economy, more attractive people end up in service jobs due to fewer higher-paying options) whether there‚Äôs some informal indicator here too. 

Maybe the sharp drop in fireworks is a signal: people just don‚Äôt have the extra cash to burn like they did over the past five years. 

The alternative is everyone just got more civic minded and didn‚Äôt want to disturb their neighbors.

"My wife and I are doing all the obvious Fallouty stuff. Plus going to Fenway to catch a Red Sox game ( We love baseball). But as fans of Fallout, other than the Freedom Trail that covers a lot of Fallout 4 locations. We were wondering if there are any themed bars or stops off the beaten path that we may be able to visit while in town (In Orlando we have Vault 5421 for instance). I've looked and don't think there are. But just wanted to check with you guys/gals . Thanks, and see you soon.",0
"My buddy is trying to quit smoking and he has strong apple opinions. I'm trying to find replacements for the ritual aspect of smoking and I figured that at least half the time it'd be similarly replaced with a 15-minute chillout and eat an apple time (idk, I don't smoke). I figured it'd help somewhat to get his favorite varieties but I can't find them in any of the stores i've visited.",0
"Posting because there's very little info available on the lockers across from Fenway. Hopefully someone who needs them in the future finds this helpful!

*TLDR: Top of the Lansdowne Garage, $11 for a standard size backpack, and you have 45 minutes after the game ends to grab your stuff (as of July 1, 2025).*

Drop-off: I went straight from work to the Red Sox game on 7/1/25 and needed a place to store my backpack. The locker truck is located on the top of the Lansdown Garage on Lansdowne St, next to Cask 'n Flagon. I got there at about 7:15pm and handed over my bag. It's literally a box truck with a bunch of small lockers inside. They charged me $11 and gave me the key to the locker that my bag was stored in. I found out when I went to pick it up after the game that they didn't actually *lock* the locker, which I'll definitely confirm they do next time.

Pickup: They said they will be open for pickup 45 minutes after the game, and if you don't get there in time, you can pick it up the next time they open (presumably before the next event at Fenway). Someone is with the truck at all times and you can pick up as early as you need to as well. When I picked up there was another guy with just a tag, no key, and his bag was stored in the truck but not in a locker. I'm not sure if it was too large to fit in the locker or they ran out of lockers, but I guess if either of those are of concern to you, they'll still hold your bag.

LMK if you have any questions!üíº",0
"I'm moving to Boston (Brighton) for grad school and I'm from the Midwest. I've visited the downtown area a few times, loved it, but didn't get to explore much else. 

I've lived in chicago for a few years and a smaller town in IL the past year, but never lived outside of IL! I'm a single 27f.

Any tips for moving to the area, or things to embrace about Boston culture? Very excited to move there and live in a new city for 2 years or more.

"Hi all - I've rented in West Roxbury since 2022, and the last year has been a minor hell. 

I'm wondering if anybody might be able to share advice or similar background.

I won't go through all of the details, but the tl;dr is that my landlord indicated (verbally) that he'd be converting my oil heat to a gas system in the fall --- using this to justify the rent increase when we resigned for September 1, 2024 --- and then dragged his feet for months working through the winter.  He is a general contractor in the area, and he wrongly believed, I think, that he could get the job done quickly. He repeatedly told me to buy small quantities of oil whenever I'd need to refill, intimating that he'd soon be finishing up the job, but low and behold, here we are in July and the job is still not done. To add insult to injury, he would always ""ask"" (scare quotes intentional) about working in the attic on this job, but then would exceed the timeframe that we'd agreed to. So, he might agree to work until 6 pm, but would routinely continue past 7 pm. I'm on the second floor, so the compressor, banging, nail gun, and other sounds were highly disturbing. There were many incidents like this and other examples of disregard and disrespect, and many are documented in texts. (""Hey, why are you still working if its 7 pm when we agreed on 6 pm."") When I finally confronted him about the job duration, he basically said, ""Tough luck, you don't have anything in writing."" On another occasion, in the context of my trying to get him to stop working in the attic  because I was at home recovering from a concussion, he said, essentially verbatim, ""you can leave whenever you want."" 

These two last quotes are highly relevant to my current situation. 

I was recently offered an opportunity to move to another apartment, with a lease starting August 1. My current lease is set to expire on August 31, 2025. But what is confusing and somewhat contradictory, is that the top of the lease lists me as an ""AT WILL TENANT."" 

I sent him an email on June 28 stating my interest in leaving at the end of July and seeking confirmation that I was ""AT WILL"" and that he would be OK with me departing, as he stated in our earlier conversation. I requested a response in writing. No response received by June 30, I followed up again by email. Then on July 1, I sent him a text message to check in. He called back and left a brief voicemail asking me to call him to discuss my ""timeline."" I replied again by text requesting that communication be in writing. Today, again, he called and left a voicemail. In none of these messages has he addressed my core concern or spoken to my desire to communicate in writing. I sent a final text today laying everything out and explaining that I wasn't trying to ""legalistic"" but only wanting things to be clear. I again asked him to respond in writing.

  
Guess what he did.....?

He sent another text with a completely content- and context-less ""please call me.""

I am at my wits end. I feel that he is playing a power game. I have not paid rent for July and am planning to move out at the end of this month. I'm assuming he'll just take my last-month deposit. 

I really do not want to communicate with him any further, and definitely do not want to talk on the phone. 

How would you proceed?",0

"Liz is 76, she just won reelection. She‚Äôll be into her 80s when her term is over. Markey is 78 and plans to run again in 2026.

For all this talk about needing strong progressives right now, they haven‚Äôt done shit to stop this. They‚Äôve flirted and mingled with the old guard their entire careers, through two Trump victories. Warren publicly defended and advocated for Biden after the debate. Both Markey and Warren endorsed Kamala on the day Biden dropped out, and made no effort to advocate for an open primary: something even Obama didn‚Äôt even do until it became clear she had enough pledged delegates. Milquetoast liberal Gavin Newsom is doing more to capture the populist left than either of them right now. Fucking Gavin Newsom! I see Warren routinely do the same stupid scripted talking points on Twitter that Schumer does, almost word for word.

We need the octogenarian class out. Sorry, but we do. If you keep voting for these folks in the primary you are actively contributing to the repeated failures. We have countless young firebrand progressives on the sideline. If they cared about this state and country, they‚Äôd find someone who‚Äôs a suitable successor and campaign for them.

"**The city of Boston**¬†[**estimates**](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2024/06/Boston%20Student%20Housing%20Report_Final.pdf)¬†**that more than 40% of the students ‚Äî nearly 70,000 who go to Boston-based schools ‚Äî live off campus, and not at home.**

**I imagine building more dorms is a win-win-win:**

* less traffic & less pressure to public transportation now that students don't have to travel as far (great for the environment!) 
* could substantially help with the housing shortage since fewer students would rent from the private market

In our younger days, my wife and I used to live in Allston, Brookline, and in Davis Square. We moved out to the burbs ten years ago, but both still work in Cambridge.

We‚Äôve visited many times, but we‚Äôre looking for the deeper scoop.

Has anyone else experienced this? Or anything similar? It looks weirdly like a skinny magpie - and I only have the comparison of seeing magpies in Australia to go off of...  
  
I am assuming maybe there is a nest somewhere and it‚Äôs being a jerk because of that? But it‚Äôs happened when we were crossing Hooker and Haskell Street and again today when my dog was attempting to just mind (and do) her business.  
  
I have searched my way through the internet and not found a single bird that looks like this little brat, so I figured I would see if any other Allston peeps have had this issue? Or at least seen something like this happen?  
Today it kept diving at her and eventually started diving at me to the point where I ended up picking up a stick to wield, even though I doubt that would have done anything.

Most times actions speak louder than words.

Congressman Derrick Van Orden took offense at the suggestion he's failing his constituents and the people of Wisconsin by voting for Trump's big Beautiful Bill. Yet some provisions of the provisions of the bill will directly impact 850,000 residents of Wisconsin who rely on government assistance for healthcare for their families and food for their children.

'I'm a member of Congress': GOP rep erupts after being accused of doing Trump's bidding

Story by Carl Gibson ‚Ä¢ 1

¬© provided by AlterNet

One House Republican who is in voting yes on H.R. 1 (President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"") is bristling at the suggestion that he's a rubber stamp for the White House. NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Melanie Zanona tweeted Wednesday that Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) didn't take kindly to the idea that Republicans simply ""do w\[h\]atever Trump says."" He reportedly used profanity in his official statement to Zanona as he emphasized his argument that he votes with his constituents in mind.

‚ÄúThe president of the United States didn't give us an assignment. We're not a bunch of little b-----s around here okay?"" Van Orden said. ""I'm a member of Congress. I represent almost 800,000 Wisconsinnites\[sic\].‚Äù However, Van Orden's assertion that he's voting for the legislation because his constituents want it would be an anomaly, given the overwhelming unpopularity of Trump's first domestic policy package of his second term. A Quinnipiac University poll from late June found that 59% of respondents opposed the bill, while just 29% of those polled were in favor of it.

The bill is particularly reviled due to its cuts to Medicaid ‚Äî the program that provides health insurance for low-income and disabled Americans. The Senate version of the bill cuts Medicaid by approximately $1 trillion over a ten-year period in order to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts (that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans). Roughly 11.8 million Americans could lose their health insurance if the Senate's version of the bill becomes law, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

H.R. 1 also cuts funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps) by hundreds of billions of dollars, which could throw nearly three million Americans off of food stamps. If signed into law, SNAP could see its funding reduced by roughly 20% ‚Äî the largest cut in history.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Wisconsin' 3rd Congressional District (which Van Orden represents) has more than 150,000 Medicaid beneficiaries who could lose their health insurance if Trump's budget bill passes. And 2022 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that there are almost 700,000 Badger State residents who rely on SNAP to afford food.

"First off, sorry for the non-political post. We can return to the back and forth political misery after this short happy thoughts (hopefully) interruption.

Second, something completely turned my day around today on my drive home, made me smile and just feel really good. I wanted to tell you about it.

Third, it had me wondering if what happened is just a Midwest thing, or if it's done all over and I just never noticed and/or realized it?

Fourth and finally, I was hoping some people could share their examples of tiny little things like this that can turn their mood around in a flash and send them singing pop songs at the top of their lungs with a huge smile ear to ear.

Driving home, I got off I90 at the exit for Highway 14 in Janesville at about 8pm or so and proceeded west. Maybe a mile or two before I was going to be hitting Tolles where I make a turn, a red (and silver maybe?) truck oncoming, flashed their headlights a couple times very quick as they got close. If you don't know, this is the old school sign given when you are heading into a speed trap. I do it whenever I can, but I haven't had someone give me the heads up in many years. I was doing in between 70-75mph, so immediately took foot of the gas and a light application to the break so there was no jerky movements or screeching, etc.... Low and behold about 10 seconds later, going a now legal 54mph, I pass a Rock County Sheriff sitting out of view when you're approaching, radar gun out the window, just waiting to snag someone.

Thank you cool and vigilant person in the red truck (that I weirdly think I passed again near Evansville somehow) for saving me a speeding ticket, making my night and helping to restore my faith that we can be nice to each other for no other reason than to just be nice. After I passed the good Sheriff, gave the flashing headlights to the next few cars coming at me, blasted the radio and sang/screamed 80's songs the rest of the ride home. Turned my mildly crap day round enough that I decided to write this all out. Predicting comments about speeding, road rules and safe driving, please note the moral of the story wasn't speeding is super fun and a great way to get to your destination faster. The moral is it's a cool thing when someone does something nice for you anonymously, with precisely zero benefit for them except the feeling of doing good.

So, the lights flashing, just a Midwest thing? We did it when I lived in Illinois (but it was mostly prevalent a few decades ago I feel), but I've lived for at least a year in several other states in my lifetime, and don't remember this anywhere else. Back in the day, both Wisconsin and Illinois, it was a common occurrence. Within about the past 5 years, this is only the second time in Wisconsin, the first being about three years ago. None in Illinois in that timeframe.

Also, what's your ""flashing headlights"" thing that can perk you up no matter what mood you're in?

"Got this email from Van Orden today, it includes his correspondence with Governor Evens, basically begging him to do something before that pile of crap bill goes through or else we will lose important things for the state of Wisconsin.  My thought is, if it requires governors to do something before the signing in order to be saved by the signing of this bill, van orden should not be voting in favor of this bill. The following is what Van Orden's email contained. What do you all think?

>¬†**Van Orden Urges Evers to Act Quickly to Align State Budget with Federal Healthcare Provisions**

>**WASHINGTON, D.C.** ‚Äì Today, Congressman Derrick Van Orden (WI-03) sent a letter to Governor Tony Evers urging him to promptly sign the Wisconsin FY 2025-27 state budget into law. The state budget includes an increase to the state provider tax rate, which must be in effect prior to the signing of the *One, Big, Beautiful Bill*.

>For nearly a decade, Wisconsin‚Äôs provider tax rate has not been updated from 1.7%. The *One, Big, Beautiful Bill* will allow non-Medicaid expansion states, like Wisconsin, with provider tax rates of up to 6% to remain untouched. In order for Wisconsin to fully capitalize on the Medicaid benefits in the bill, it is imperative the governor sign the state budget into law as soon as possible.

>‚ÄúI cannot emphasize enough the importance of signing the proposed state budget into law without delay. As you are aware, timely enactment is especially critical this year due to the proposed increase in the state provider tax, which must be effectuated before the anticipated signing of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill on or around July 4, 2025,‚Äù **Rep. Van Orden stated in the letter.**

>**The congressman continued,** ‚ÄúDelaying the state budget enactment beyond July 3rd risks losing vital opportunities for the state‚Äôs healthcare system and the Wisconsinites who rely on it. Healthcare and rural healthcare, in particular, is vital to us in Wisconsin. We cannot leave anything on the table. Please act swiftly to sign the budget and secure the provider tax increase in time to meet this critical federal deadline.‚Äù

>‚ÄúI came to Washington to fight for those in rural Wisconsin. By voting for this bill, I will be doing just that, and I am looking forward to working with our state senators, assembly members, and you to make sure our fellow Wisconsinites cannot just survive but thrive.‚Äù

>The Honorable Tony Evers

>Governor of Wisconsin

>115 East Capitol

>Madison, WI 53702

>July 2, 2025

>Dear Governor Evers,

>I wanted to send you a follow up note from our conversation yesterday.

>I cannot emphasize enough the importance of signing the proposed state budget into law without delay. As you are aware, timely enactment is especially critical this year due to the proposed increase in the state provider tax, which must be effectuated before the anticipated signing of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill on or around July 4, 2025.

>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I implore you to put politics aside, and our neighbors first.

>The One Big Beautiful Bill will have a profoundly beneficial impact on Wisconsinites from all socioeconomic backgrounds by ensuring that Badger Care, in its current form and scope, remains solvent into the future and bolstering our rural healthcare systems.

>Wisconsin will immediately receive a $500,000,000 plus up for rural healthcare infrastructure, and an additional billion dollars annually for healthcare in our great state.

>Additionally, this bill protects SNAP for those most in need, prevents a 25% tax hike on Wisconsin families, makes the Small Business Deduction permanent and increases it to 23%, and removes the Death Tax so our farmers can pass their land onto the next generation.

>Delaying the state budget enactment beyond July 3rd risks losing vital opportunities for the state‚Äôs healthcare system and the Wisconsinites who rely on it. Healthcare and rural healthcare, in particular, is vital to us in Wisconsin. We cannot leave anything on the table.

>I came to Washington to fight for those in rural Wisconsin. By voting for this bill, I will be doing just that, and I am looking forward to working with our state senators, assembly members, and you to make sure our fellow Wisconsinites cannot just survive but thrive.

>Forward!

>All the best,

"This is one small way that the BBB makes life more expensive and difficult for working Wisconsinites.

The IRS Direct File program was created under the Biden administration and was successfully piloted in over a dozen states in 2024. Its aim is to give US citizens a way to conveniently and freely file their taxes online directly with the IRS. [According the website](https://directfile.irs.gov/state), Wisconsin has also become an eligible state to use this free software.

A system like this would replace the contrived role of software giants like Intuit/Turbotax. Intuit has been bribing politicians for years to prevent the IRS from creating a Direct File program. Make no mistake: Intuit is a greedy middle-man leaching off hard-working Americans. They provide zero value and exist only to make filing your taxes more difficult and expensive.

Intuit overcharges for basic tax filing services and pressures users to pay when they don't need to. They utilize dark patterns in their software and lobby to stop the IRS from building its own public filing system for citizens to use.

I recommend calling your elected officials and ask that they strip this provision from this abomination of a bill. We should not be required to purchase or use 3rd party software to file our taxes with the IRS. It is absurd and nakedly corrupt to scrap the IRS Direct File program at this point.

Wisconsin republican congressman Tony Wied can be reached at (202) 225‚Äì5665. His office answered on the first ring and seemed keen to pass on my message. I plan to call every day to voice concerns about other aspects of this legislation as well.

They claimed the herd that was seen was at 500% desired population, but during their townhall meeting there was no evidence provided to back that claim, simply someone who is hired to handle this kind of this and his ""infrared drones"". During this townhall meeting the plan was discussed, and there was no mention to the public it would be taking place. Once resident arrived to speak, but was denied due to lack of time. The plan moved forward.

The coming months, trucks could be seen on River Road, parked in the woods and being operated by ""village employee sharpshooters"" (no credentials on their marksmanship or background in urban hunting was provided). Deer were seen running across the road in front of cars all in an attempt to live. Across the street, a daycare center. 

[Location of culling and daycare.](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.2307052,-89.3626575,3a,90y,291.54h,90.08t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sZQ61hupTcsfE6JPbuJs0bw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-0.07849876796183253%26panoid%3DZQ61hupTcsfE6JPbuJs0bw%26yaw%3D291.5392329390537!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

  
I shared my disgust with their plan and lack of evidence, but was met with deaf ears. Fast forward to the spring of 2025, heavy equipment arrives at the location of the culling, and soon with it a developer's sign, **more condos.**

As a resident of DeForest, I don't know what to do. I drive River Road every single day, and have watched it slowly being destroyed. What was once natural beauty and farm lands has divulged into a **private** baseball diamond complex, Pinseekers([which already filed bankruptcy](https://www.wkow.com/news/pinseekers-deforest-files-for-bankruptcy/article_2c937126-f085-11ef-b1de-13d23c731836.html)) and more apartment buildings.

  
I was very angry when Pinseekers was [given a TIF-Development](https://www.hngnews.com/deforest_times/news/local/deforest-village-board-approves-tif-development-for-pinseekers-project/article_e7bb8196-3fa5-5a3c-a8f6-6d7b2a460f22.html), even more angry when they added [more apartment buildings](https://www.edgeatconservancy.com/) and decided on the [private baseball fields](https://www.deforestwi.gov/232/DeForest-Kwik-Trip-Athletic-Complex).

  
I guess this long rant is wondering, what do I do? What can I do? I feel as though the village I have lived in for the past 6 years, my wife 30+ years is rapidly destroying the natural beauty around it and becoming just another suburb of Madison.

  
Maybe it just feels good to get it off my chest...",0
"Trying to plan a brief weekend adventure in August. Coming over on the ferry on a Friday and we are looking to do a great day hike on Saturday. Suggestions please and thank you. 

Our wish list is:

10 miles give or take,  a loop would be perfect since we will be in one vehicle. If it is an out and back, scenery that is equally engaging both ways would be wonderful. 

2 hours or less from Manitowoc.

"Yesterday‚Äôs demolition at 1210 Milwaukee Ave in South Milwaukee revealed a ghost sign that hadn‚Äôt seen daylight in over 60 years.

"Just skimming the article, because I'm not sure how much of RJ I can take today. The one thing I did notice is he started with blaming the Democrats... because they didn't impose tax cuts on the rich when they were in power?

Sure. Maybe that's true. Too tired to research it right now. If it is, that would be yet another issue with establishment Democrats either a) trying too hard to be centrist, or b) being paid off. These are both long-standing problems with the Democratic establishment.

You know what it *isn't*, though? *RELEVANT!*

*TLDR: Top of the Lansdowne Garage, $11 for a standard size backpack, and you have 45 minutes after the game ends to grab your stuff (as of July 1, 2025).*

Drop-off: I went straight from work to the Red Sox game on 7/1/25 and needed a place to store my backpack. The locker truck is located on the top of the Lansdown Garage on Lansdowne St, next to Cask 'n Flagon. I got there at about 7:15pm and handed over my bag. It's literally a box truck with a bunch of small lockers inside. They charged me $11 and gave me the key to the locker that my bag was stored in. I found out when I went to pick it up after the game that they didn't actually *lock* the locker, which I'll definitely confirm they do next time.

Pickup: They said they will be open for pickup 45 minutes after the game, and if you don't get there in time, you can pick it up the next time they open (presumably before the next event at Fenway). Someone is with the truck at all times and you can pick up as early as you need to as well. When I picked up there was another guy with just a tag, no key, and his bag was stored in the truck but not in a locker. I'm not sure if it was too large to fit in the locker or they ran out of lockers, but I guess if either of those are of concern to you, they'll still hold your bag.

"Hi all - I've rented in West Roxbury since 2022, and the last year has been a minor hell. 

I'm wondering if anybody might be able to share advice or similar background.

I won't go through all of the details, but the tl;dr is that my landlord indicated (verbally) that he'd be converting my oil heat to a gas system in the fall --- using this to justify the rent increase when we resigned for September 1, 2024 --- and then dragged his feet for months working through the winter.  He is a general contractor in the area, and he wrongly believed, I think, that he could get the job done quickly. He repeatedly told me to buy small quantities of oil whenever I'd need to refill, intimating that he'd soon be finishing up the job, but low and behold, here we are in July and the job is still not done. To add insult to injury, he would always ""ask"" (scare quotes intentional) about working in the attic on this job, but then would exceed the timeframe that we'd agreed to. So, he might agree to work until 6 pm, but would routinely continue past 7 pm. I'm on the second floor, so the compressor, banging, nail gun, and other sounds were highly disturbing. There were many incidents like this and other examples of disregard and disrespect, and many are documented in texts. (""Hey, why are you still working if its 7 pm when we agreed on 6 pm."") When I finally confronted him about the job duration, he basically said, ""Tough luck, you don't have anything in writing."" On another occasion, in the context of my trying to get him to stop working in the attic  because I was at home recovering from a concussion, he said, essentially verbatim, ""you can leave whenever you want."" 

These two last quotes are highly relevant to my current situation. 

I was recently offered an opportunity to move to another apartment, with a lease starting August 1. My current lease is set to expire on August 31, 2025. But what is confusing and somewhat contradictory, is that the top of the lease lists me as an ""AT WILL TENANT."" 

I sent him an email on June 28 stating my interest in leaving at the end of July and seeking confirmation that I was ""AT WILL"" and that he would be OK with me departing, as he stated in our earlier conversation. I requested a response in writing. No response received by June 30, I followed up again by email. Then on July 1, I sent him a text message to check in. He called back and left a brief voicemail asking me to call him to discuss my ""timeline."" I replied again by text requesting that communication be in writing. Today, again, he called and left a voicemail. In none of these messages has he addressed my core concern or spoken to my desire to communicate in writing. I sent a final text today laying everything out and explaining that I wasn't trying to ""legalistic"" but only wanting things to be clear. I again asked him to respond in writing.

  
Guess what he did.....?

He sent another text with a completely content- and context-less ""please call me.""

I am at my wits end. I feel that he is playing a power game. I have not paid rent for July and am planning to move out at the end of this month. I'm assuming he'll just take my last-month deposit. 

I really do not want to communicate with him any further, and definitely do not want to talk on the phone. 

How would you proceed?",0

"Liz is 76, she just won reelection. She‚Äôll be into her 80s when her term is over. Markey is 78 and plans to run again in 2026.

For all this talk about needing strong progressives right now, they haven‚Äôt done shit to stop this. They‚Äôve flirted and mingled with the old guard their entire careers, through two Trump victories. Warren publicly defended and advocated for Biden after the debate. Both Markey and Warren endorsed Kamala on the day Biden dropped out, and made no effort to advocate for an open primary: something even Obama didn‚Äôt even do until it became clear she had enough pledged delegates. Milquetoast liberal Gavin Newsom is doing more to capture the populist left than either of them right now. Fucking Gavin Newsom! I see Warren routinely do the same stupid scripted talking points on Twitter that Schumer does, almost word for word.

We need the octogenarian class out. Sorry, but we do. If you keep voting for these folks in the primary you are actively contributing to the repeated failures. We have countless young firebrand progressives on the sideline. If they cared about this state and country, they‚Äôd find someone who‚Äôs a suitable successor and campaign for them.

"**The city of Boston**¬†[**estimates**](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2024/06/Boston%20Student%20Housing%20Report_Final.pdf)¬†**that more than 40% of the students ‚Äî nearly 70,000 who go to Boston-based schools ‚Äî live off campus, and not at home.**

**I imagine building more dorms is a win-win-win:**

* less traffic & less pressure to public transportation now that students don't have to travel as far (great for the environment!) 
* could substantially help with the housing shortage since fewer students would rent from the private market 
* flexibility for students, for example dorms would likely be furnished, always easier to negotiate with school if they are studying abroad, graduating one semester early etc.

I'm sure someone in city government has thought of this. My question is: does anyone have insight into why this isn‚Äôt happening?

In our younger days, my wife and I used to live in Allston, Brookline, and in Davis Square. We moved out to the burbs ten years ago, but both still work in Cambridge.

We‚Äôve visited many times, but we‚Äôre looking for the deeper scoop. 

What‚Äôs the deal these days? How are things trending? What‚Äôs up with Mass and Cass? Are the mom and pop restaurants getting pushed out like elsewhere? How would you characterize the different areas? Does the silver line work?

"So I live in the Lower Allston area and recently when I walk my dog - particularly when we are on Hooker Street - there is this mostly black bird with white stripes and a black pointy beak (not a crow, not a pigeon, not a dove, or a woodpecker‚Ä¶ no clue what this jerk is) who keeps DIVING at my dog.  
Has anyone else experienced this? Or anything similar? It looks weirdly like a skinny magpie - and I only have the comparison of seeing magpies in Australia to go off of...  
  
I am assuming maybe there is a nest somewhere and it‚Äôs being a jerk because of that? But it‚Äôs happened when we were crossing Hooker and Haskell Street and again today when my dog was attempting to just mind (and do) her business.  
  
I have searched my way through the internet and not found a single bird that looks like this little brat, so I figured I would see if any other Allston peeps have had this issue? Or at least seen something like this happen?  
Today it kept diving at her and eventually started diving at me to the point where I ended up picking up a stick to wield, even though I doubt that would have done anything.

This is quite literally something out of my nightmares.",0

"After a judge ruled that Maine was violating constitutional rights by failing to provide attorneys for poor defendants, a remedy was set in motion: habeas corpus hearings in Bangor and Lewiston that could have led to the release of jailed individuals without legal counsel.  
  
But on June 20, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court hit pause ‚Äî halting all planned hearings until an emergency appeal from the state is resolved. That decision leaves people stuck in jail, some for weeks, with no lawyer and no clear path forward.  
  
In the meantime, Maine‚Äôs public defense system continues to face a crisis: 225 cases still need lawyers, and 30 defendants have been jailed more than 10 days without counsel.

"It‚Äôs here, the anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. We mark the eve of the 20th‚Äôs famous stand on a hill in Pennsylvania. It‚Äôs a moment gives cause for reflection on what our nation stands for, what so many people in so many ways have shed blood, sweat, and tears to cultivate and defend.

What did those boys from Maine stand fast for?  Doubtless a diverse set of causes but chiefly, the dignity and integrity of wage labor. They fought to defend a nation that stood for the idea that every person was entitled to working for what amounted to a living for their family. They fought against oligarchy and forces that degraded the opportunity of the common person.

With the progression of Donald‚Äôs bill through the senate, I am struck by the sense we are rejecting the vision that makes America great.  The essence of what great Americans have striven towards. This bill does not provide for increasing the prosperity of our society as a whole and does not care for the challenges future generations will face. It provides for the stratification of wealth and leads us down a path where regular people become more and more dependent on the prerogatives of the super wealthy. 

It is clear that the stance of the true American patriot is one that stands in opposition to this bill. It represents a departure from our national journey; a journey involving the expansion of the rights and freedoms to which all Americans are entitled. 162 years ago, the boys of Maine stood courageously, defending our nation, the idea of the integrity of everyone in this country. They would have stood against this bill and the positions of the reality star who inhabits the Whitehouse.

"Perhaps I'm making more of a deal of this than I should, but I emailed the State Attorney General. I encourage you to do that same. I sent the email because the Westbrook PD altered a photo from a drug bust, likely using AI, then denied it and misled the public. When called out, they deleted the post and gave a weak excuse about adding a logo. They gaslit the public and even with their apology, continued to lie. Police department have been watermarking photos for decades- that was clearly AI. 

 This kind of behavior from law enforcement is a serious red flag. It raises concerns about evidence tampering, transparency, and public trust. I felt it needed to be brought to the attention of state officials so it doesn‚Äôt get swept under the rug or set a bad precedent for other departments. You may feel like this was a ""foolish"" mistake, but I felt obligated to report this. I feel this is much bigger than a Facebook post. 

I also worry that the individuals who were rightfully convicted might actually find themselves released because of this debacle. If we don't set a clear line, this will just be the beginning of many more ""Photoshop mishaps.""

Lisa offered a knowing smile.¬†

‚ÄúThey already suspect!‚Äù Susan cried, clutching her expensive purse. ‚ÄúThey *know* my pattern - first I say I‚Äôm concerned, or *highly concerned* in more urgent matters, and I then appear to go through a principled internal debate. And then I vote with all the other republicans.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhich ones know this,‚Äù Lisa asked?



‚ÄúAll of them!‚Äù Susan cried, pulling out a new attack ad against her. 



Lisa, always more stoic in private, stroked her long blonde hair and said cooly: ‚ÄúSo we do it the old way: One of us votes ‚Äòno,‚Äù on the big beautiful bill and the other ‚Äòyes.‚Äô In truth we both want it to pass, but the optics split like a good fish. I‚Äôll take the fall this time.‚Äù



Susan blinked, a big smile on her face. ‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù she said, in a sort of put-on surprise. In the background a lobbyist cried into a velvet curtain.



Lisa nodded, unruffled. ‚ÄúMain‚Äôs on your tail for ‚Äô26. Alaska won‚Äôt vote until ‚Äô28. I've been planting some stories about possibly going independent or caucusing with the democrats. We got this gurl.‚Äù

"Believe me, I already know Indiana law favors the landlord over the tenant in most instances, regardless of the matter at hand, but I just find it impossible to believe what I‚Äôve witnessed this week.  A quick Google search of ‚ÄúThe Admiral Apartments‚Äù of even a search on Reddit and you‚Äôll get a glimpse into the fraud of ‚ÄúNorthside Flats‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndy Flats.‚Äù It goes far beyond issues relating to rent, as was reported by ABC, CBS, and FOX 59 earlier in the year.  Thankfully, I‚Äôve moved and have attempted to put the nightmare of the previous months behind me, still in disbelief that MAH Mid-Town Flats, LLC dba Northside Flats has been able to get away with such blatant fraud in this state as long as they have.
What I saw earlier this week, however, has been the most unbelievable thing I believe I‚Äôve ever witnessed.  Disabled individuals who had fallen and were seriously injured due to non working elevators for months  (see my other post for reference) were told that if they dropped their suit against the company they would be moved to a lower floor so as to not have to climb stairs.  Only to then be met with a retaliatory eviction the moment they dropped their suit.
Small claims court didn‚Äôt seem too interested in seeing evidence at their hearing.  Along with the evidence of multiple others.  Multiple attorneys won‚Äôt even look at this and for some reason don‚Äôt find it highly suspicious that so many multiple people suddenly stopped paying rent at the exact same time.  (I know, before you say you can‚Äôt withhold rent, no one ever did, intentionally.  We were all led to believe the company was under new management for months.  I have the actual letter stating do not pay rent any longer to Northside.)
News outlets no longer seem concerned, the attorney generals office doesn‚Äôt seem concerned, and most attorneys I‚Äôve spoken with are unresponsive.

"Wanted to give anyone a warning who decides to park near the Taxman Brewery on 336 S Delaware St. I parked in a nearby spot that had a sign from LAZ Parking and I paid $12.50 for 2 hours of parking using their website (a bit steep I thought, but I was meeting friends for dinner and didn't think much of it.) A few weeks later, I get a letter with images of my car entering and leaving the facility, and an $102 bill for an ""expired permit."" Understandably, I freaked out. The letter is filled with threatening language, including threats to have my case sent to a debt collector and my car booted. I've already attempted to dispute the case through their requested channels, sending them the screenshots that clearly show that I paid for their spot.

After the initial panic subsided, I did a bit more research. LAZ Parking has TONS of complaints on the Better Business Bureau website.

She lives about 2 hours away from Indy but has talked about moving there. The job market in the area where she lives is absolute trash. 

She expected to go to medical school due to her grades and work ethic, but she is autistic and we believe that is part of the reason she did not get into medical school (the other half being that she didn't come from a 1%er family that could pay for everything and make donations to the University.) She has a very hard time interviewing with strangers, and sometimes comes off as ""flat"" with people she doesn't know well. She \*did\* get on the short list for Veterinary Medicine at Tufts... but that didn't materialize.

She also didn't network while doing her Master's. Somebody forgot to tell her that ""who you know"" can be more important than \*what\* you know. 

She has worked various jobs to a high level, and has a small business. She comes with a list of references a mile long. 

I KNOW THAT JOBS ARE POSTED ONLINE. I also know that these faceless AI resume readers don't work for most people. For those who work there, or have, or know somebody - what is the best way to get one's foot in the door? Are there any networking events, any recruiters, anything where a human contact can help? People always love her once they get to know her and she's worked too damn hard to only be making $48K/yr. ",0

""Greetings,

I have no idea to whom this email will get to but¬† I pay 1635 dollars each month to vinebrook homes in indianapolis for rent at address withheld in indianapolis indiana 46229 or¬†when i call their customer service line ¬†855-513-5678 ¬†( and this is pretty ironic as there is zero customer service on the other end of that line ). 

I get some answering service that wants to ask my my name my address and spell it out to me every time i call.¬† It is 2025 and they dont have caller id yet? or a history of calls since i have made several each day after my A/C was knocked out by a storm that took down trees and power lines in the neighborhood i live in

.It has been 4 days , 2 business days, since i called AND i filled out a work order.¬† Do you know how hot it has been in Indianapolis and the other markets that you guys own in? It has been 90 plus outside.¬† Do you know how hot that is inside with no air conditioner?¬†¬†Why cant i at least receive a phone call stating where i am in the queue of these work orders?¬† And how many are more important than a resident that has medical history of asthma?¬†

 I realize indiana has zero tenant protection laws that protect the lessee ( term from the lease) from the lessor.¬† How does a company survive with this such terrible ""customer service""?¬† how can not even a phone call come from the maintenance staff telling them how long it will be?

According to internet percentages which have gotten better, ""Some sources indicate that over 90% of HVAC breakdowns are related to electrical issues, and faulty capacitors are a major component of those electrical problems.¬†Capacitors are responsible for providing the initial electrical charge to start and run the compressor and fan motors.¬†When they fail, it can lead to a variety of issues, including the unit not cooling properly, making strange noises, or even shutting down completely. 

""This is literally a 15 minute fix, why not try to switch that out quickly since it has been so hot and humidity is high outside.¬† Do you know how difficult it is to even cook in 100 degree weather?¬† I have had to stay with friends for two days.¬† How is this delay acceptable?¬† This letter will also be sent to the housing agency here and also the health department.¬† Now is that going to do anything?¬† i dont know but i think it is awful to leave residents without even an avenue to talk with about a serious problem.



What do you guys think?  How can corporations get away with this type of ghosting for residents that pay double what we were paying just a few years ago.  Please spare me the ""boot strap conversation and how my choices led me here"".  I certainly didnt conjure up a storm to knock out the A/c in the middle of the harsh summer.

"Supporters of a new income tax credit for middle-class households with children couldn‚Äôt overcome Gov. Ned Lamont‚Äôs objections this spring, despite strong grassroots support and broad backing in the General Assembly.

But advocates hope new analyses later this year on tax inequities and Connecticut‚Äôs surging cost of living will provide the ammunition they need to overcome any opposition in 2026.

‚ÄúWe are absolutely committed to continuing to make the case for a child tax credit,‚Äù said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut, which collected nearly 1,300 supporting signatures via an online petition over the winter and spring. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that families in our state need more support to make life more affordable.‚Äù

The most popular proposal circulating at the Capitol in recent years involves a $600-per-child credit, up to $1,800 per household, for low- and middle-income families. This relief also would have been refundable, meaning that even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to apply the credit to, it would still have $600 per child added to its refund.

But that plan came with a $300 million to $350 million annual price tag, and some state officials were wary Connecticut couldn‚Äôt spare the revenue ‚Äî despite an annual average surplus of $1.8 billion between 2017 and 2024, and a [nearly $2.2 billion projected cushion](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/opm/budget/comptrollerletter/fy-2025/fy-25_june_2025_comptroller_letter.pdf?rev=4f91de9082284a2d913fe7c83c663d53&hash=2E7A0D7275AAF6F5E2F6B92B8D1E679B) in the fiscal year that closed Monday.

Needless to say, his new job won't be starting until the middle of the month. Our families are awful and after the baby passed away, they went back to their usual abusive selves. I need housing, food, money to get an Airbnb or SOMETHING for the next 2 weeks until I get some funds again.
Anyone have ANY IDEA of what we can do? I am not a 211 fan especially in a real emergency!! Please help.....",0
I'm currently homeless and was temporarily sleeping on the new Haven green. It was really early in the morning maybe 2am or 3am and all the other homeless people were asleep and not really anyone around. So I peed in a dark 1 time against a church and 1 time behind a tree. There was a cop across the street in his car I don't think he saw me cause of my angle and the lack of light on me. I was in the dark of 3 trees close together.i think someone might have seen me the first time because there might have been someone sitting on a bench facing me maybe 100-200+ ft from me. Probably homeless too idk. But I read another post somewhere that the punishment for doing that if your caught is being labeled a sex offender. Idk that till just tonight when I read the kids post about a similar incident. ,0

Just applied to a job working for the city of Hartford. Was wondering what the timeline looks like from application to interview. I know the state jobs take forever to hire people but was curious if the city jobs were any better,0
"I was living abroad for 4 years and couldn't renew my license when it expired, so I need to retake the driver's test and get a new one. I read that I also need to take the written knowledge test, which is fine. But I saw on a driving school's website, ""Hold your permit for a minimum of 120 days while driving with a licensed instructor or driver over 20-years-old who has held a license for at least four years.""

Do I seriously need to wait 120 days before I can take the driving test? I understand that rule for teenagers who have never driven before, but I've been driving for years. I can't find this on any other website, so I'm not sure if it's accurate. ",0

"My life is falling apart and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore

I‚Äôve been struggling with mental health issues, since 2020, I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD & PTSD.

I‚Äôve been fired at every single job since Dec 2021. I would do everything I can to keep the job it‚Äôs useless. When the mood swings I would spend days in bed without even eating and showering.

Last October after getting fired, my psychiatrist told me I have ADHD, and he prescribed me METHYLPHENIDATE. Was the only medication that ever worked for me, after the second month during evaluation I told him that I drink alcohol a few times. He stopped giving me the medication. 

Since then my mental became worse, I lost the desire to do anything, even the gym. I can‚Äôt function. And then I found Crystal meth around December, it was taking me to a rabbit hole, and it also stopped working. I stopped using.

I went back to get another psychiatrist, he doesn‚Äôt want to give me the methylphenidate due to my past of using drugs, he only give me Atomoxetine and Escitalopram, despite telling him they don‚Äôt work he told me it‚Äôs take it or leave it.

I asked to go get tested to send for everything, he said it doesn‚Äôt matter he won‚Äôt give me other medication than what he currently giving me. 

I have no jobs, I‚Äôm losing my friends, my family doesn‚Äôt understand mental illness it‚Äôs a cultural thing. Now I‚Äôm terrified, will I end up in the streets one day begging for $1 and eating from the trash while I never shower or anything.

What is this system? What is wrong with the doctors? Is there anything or something I can do? I‚Äôm losing it. ",0

I know that attendance is always low, and they have gone downhill, especially this last season, but they were there. I like going. There's really not much else to do in the area.

Not going to lie, if another AHL team moved in I would be fine, but also kind of sad. Pennsylvania has 3 AHL teams, and California has 5. We should steal one of their teams . Or one of theirs can go to Canada, and we keep the Bridgeport Islanders.

It would be such a loss for Bridgeport as a city, and Total Mortgage Arena. I am semi open to stealing an ECHL team as well. ",0
