"Hi all!

So, my fiancé and I are wanting to buy this house in broad ripple. The only issue is that it is located in an AE flood zone /:  we got quoted $4000 for the flood insurance and this just seems so high. We apparently can’t add flood insurance to our home insurance. It has to go through FEMA. We were also told that because it’s the government, that 4000 isn’t something we can pay monthly. We have to pay it upfront each year. 

So my questions are, is this normal? Do you pay something similar or less? What insurance agency did you contact (we talked to homesite insurance)? And do you have any advice?

"Hello All,

I am looking for someone who is from a different cultural background here in Portland that would allow me to ask them a few questions for an assignment in my communications class. It would not take long, maybe 20-30 minutes at most. I will post the directions here...

&#x200B;

 

Kory Floyd (2011) discusses many dimensions by which cultures vary:  

**Individualism vs. Collectivism** (cultures vary in terms of their emphasis on individuals versus groups, or the ""collective whole"" in their societies)

**Low- vs. High-context** (the extent to which cultures rely on contextual cues to determine the meaning of communication behaviors)

**Low vs. High-Power** (the degree to which power, money, education, age, experience, and/or other valued characteristics is evenly distributed amongst people in a society)

**Masculine vs. Feminism** (the degree to which cultures cherish traditional masculine or feminine values)

**Monochronic vs. Polychronic** (cultures vary in terms of how they view the concept of time)

**Uncertainty Avoidance** (cultures vary in terms of how they embrace or reject uncertainty- i.e., cultures lie on a spectrum where one end represents the need to preserve the status quo, while the other end represents willingness to embrace change)

1. Interview a friend or acquaintance from a different cultural background to describe his/her culture, in terms of how these dimensions represent it.  
2. Explain, specifically, the culture your interviewee identifies with.
3. Ask the person you interview how they view American cultural values.  How do they see these US values in relation to their own personal values?  How has this affected a communication event in their lives

IF INTERESTED message me. Thank you."|Portland|2018|False|0

"As far as I can tell, most other states and countries do. Are we going to find ourselves behind the ball here? Trading them appears to be banned via an archaic law that has nothing to do with digital currency itself. All the candidates talk about expanding our economy and catching up with the rest of the country yet here we are on the verge of the explosion of a potential new currency and we can't even buy it or use it like the rest of the country.

*To be clear, I'm talking about Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Also, I happened to be in contact with Barasso's office on another matter, so I just let the woman I was talking to know about this. But I think it needs to be an issue with our state congress and governor more so then our federal representatives since they can change the law."|wyoming|2017|False|0

"I'm looking for a new set of modest-priced speakers and just can't convince myself to drop nearly $300 on something I haven't heard in person.

Fry's seems to have a hard time with the discounted speakers never being in stock, and even if they were, half the time they won't have an example hooked up in the listening room.

I tried the Best Buy in Fiesta Mall and they didn't have anything resembling a listening setup.

The guy in old-town Gilbert with the vintage stuff seemed okay, but speakers seem to be one of the few parts of audio where decent new kit seems to be reliably better than quality old kit.

Seems like most shops that specialize in audio gear are mostly interested in car audio, or at the sort of places that are so expensive that my budget wouldn't even cover the cost of the first consultation in a 29-step process that results in sourcing artisan amplifiers from Zanzibar and homeopathic cables for several hundred dollars per metre."|phoenix|2016|False|0

"Not sure if my fellow Georgians are aware, but Camden County, on the coast just north of Jacksonville, has been planning a ""commercial Spaceport"" for years now.  Any news you read about it is usually some glowing fluff piece, but NOTHING is going on.  The County has already been robbed of millions of dollars and absolutely nothing has happened.  I live about 6 miles from the test site on Harriet's Bluff.  Not a thing is happening there.  The site proposed is the former site of Tiokol, where one of the largest accidental plant explosions in American history occured when the magnesium manufacturing building caught fire.  At the time they were making flairs for the Vietnam War.  It was a disaster, and I know people whose relatives died.  Some residents still get sick with magnesium poisoning to this day.  The ground is literally poison, the work needed to clean the area and make it usable and safe for such a project would require astronomical (pun intended) cost and resources.  Our congressman Buddy Carter has also recently ""purchased"" about 350 acres near the site for next to nothing.  The County board of commissioners openly admit they are accountable to no one.  And despite being public land, you can be shot trying to enter.

The County, State, and Federal Government are literally robbing the tax payer, without even the courtesy of a plan of action, however fake it may be.  It's straight criminal and no legitimate news organization is looking into this.  If you or someone you know had the means or interest to help look into this and hold our elected officials accountable it would be greatly appreciated.  The people of Georgia deserve better.

TL;DR - Camden County government openly robbing the tax payers to such a blatant degree that even the most crooked of politicians would blush."|Georgia|2020|True|0

"Hello all you beautiful Melbournians!

Just reaching out before summer starts to see if anyone is keen to have some fun this summer playing Pub Cricket. I've played since my arrival in Melbourne 8 years ago and it is absolutely fantastic. 

YPCA - Yarra Pub Cricket Association is the competition. We have 12 pubs in and around the Yarra area each with a team. The competition has been running since the 80s and is as strong as ever.

It's super social - ages ranging from the young whipper snappers to the wise old veteran who once bowled 150 plus and scored 100 off of two overs (Definitely true)! Open to all genders. Open to all skill levels. It's really about having fun with good people on a Sunday. 

If you're keen, have a look on the website for more information. 

Alternatively, send me a message and I can give you more information. 

Have a wonderful day! And bring on a beautiful summer!!"|melbourne|2023|False|0

"Perhaps I don’t purchase stuff online much or I’m completely clueless about how the postal services work but the past two items I’ve ordered in the past month have taken such interesting routes to arrive to where I live. 

One example - I live in Noble Park for reference, I ordered something from the Good Guys. The package that was picked up from Essendon on the 24th of October and arrived at Melbourne Airport on the same day. The package was then scanned into a depot in Newcastle NSW on the 26th before returning back to Melbourne and being delivered on the 27th.

"As we all know we're in a major cost of living crisis, inflation, interest rates, rents, food, petrol, etc. 

Yet for a while all the GPs around me have started charging. $40+ gap in many places. Some of them started with new customers, but then they started charging everyone.

Coming from the UK, I find this truly bizarre and counterproductive. I can't comprehend having to pay to go to the GP. It means that if it's not very serious, I just won't go. Yet - I can afford it. It's just the principle. I'd rather Google the issue - which I know - is terrible!

But what about those for who $40 is just not possible? Who have to go without food so their kid can see a GP? I find this disgusting. 

The point of free healthcare is to catch serious issues sooner, and to prevent contagious diseases spreading as much. To protect the healthcare system from other pressure! Charging for it completely undermines this. 

What we are seeing is the healthcare system basically become useless overnight. The Victorian government supposedly cared so much about health yet now it suddenly doesn't matter a bit? Most of these GP clinics are laying off Doctors, and they are basically empty when you go in them now. 

And yesterday we also saw the closure of all the Respiratory clinics in the state. Overnight. Gone. 

Why is this happening? What's going on? What is everyone doing when they're sick? Is this a disaster in the making?"|melbourne|2023|True|0

"Hey everyone, just wanting to do a shout out to a super cute store in Richmond. It’s called PICTURE SEARCH!! 
I stumbled upon it the other week and wanted to share my experience. The front of the shop reminds me of something out of the Notting Hill movie, it’s so cute and quaint. Inside, there would be thousands of vinyl records, DVDs and VCRs, and behind the counter is the sweetest, kindest dude who owns the business - his name is Derek and he is so cool and intelligent and knowledgeable. 
He has sourced pretty much every movie that is hard to find and this is the last video hire store in Melbourne! Hashtag Nostalgia! He’s got an epic collection of vinyl records too. 
So hot foot it there and check it out. I hope he is really successful because he is so kind, he deserves it! Please share and spread the word.

"Does anyone know of a Reddit group of individuals that work in small businesses that do their company's IT/security in the Huntsville area? I realize there are bigger groups out there but I am trying to find ones that are here in Huntsville or close to it. I'm the only one at my small company (under 10 people) and I was hoping there were others out there in that situation. It doesn't have to be solo people but maybe just a few IT/sec people that work in small businesses. 

I was hoping to have a small community to share experiences or basic questions about security or best practices for a small environment in Huntsville. We can't really afford $3000 classes or expensive conferences. I would be more than willing to help anyone with their questions or direct them to resources that I've found.

"So I was just thinking of the wonders of light pollution we have in Wichita, and a thought occurred to me: Have one night where the city turns off all outside signs and all non-art lights. 

I don't know how practical this would be to get arranged, and how to go about it. There are probably also some technical issues with things light streetlights, and potentially requirements to keep lights on for streets or something. 

If that happened, I'm not certain, but it'd be likely that we could get it dark enough if we didn't have the lights to be able to see the milky way from inside the city. Apparently, it's not a unique idea: http://www.andrimagnason.com/cds-and-other-projects/lights-out-stars-on/ 

Plus it'd be cool to see the milky way behind the city landmarks with your own eyes (though that would mostly require it to be earlier in the year) or as an actual photo. Sure someone could do composites, but there are even people in Wichita who don't see it very often, even though it's a short drive away, if you live in the city. (To be fair, on really, really rare occasions, it can almost be made out within the light dome of Wichita) 

So, do you guys think this is something cool and practical, and if so, where would one start the discussion to see if it's feasible: The city council, public works division, police department, or? "|Wichita|2017|False|0

"tl;dr: Please PM me if you can pick up yogurt from two local health food stores and ship it refrigerated to Minnesota. I am more than happy to pay you for everything including your time.
----------
Today is my girlfriend's birthday. She has [ME/CFS](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html) (yes, it's quite real) and relies upon a large number of dietary restrictions, many of which have been learned by trial and error over the years, to reduce her symptoms. We live in Minnesota, and were supposed to be in Wichita over the weekend. She's been feeling really good lately, so neither of us expected any problems with the trip, but she unexpectedly crashed at the last minute and we weren't able to go. Early last week, I had planned an extra birthday surprise for her. I discovered that two health food stores in Wichita carry her favorite yogurt, which is made from sheep's milk, and is the only yogurt that she has proven to be able to eat without consequences. You can't buy it in Minnesota; we're well outside the distribution area. She's told me how much she misses it since she moved back up here from New Mexico, so I was pretty excited to find it in Wichita and thought it would be a fun birthday surprise to order a whole case for her. I called one of the stores and asked them to order a case, with the understanding that we'd be there to pick it up this weekend. They weren't 100% certain they'd be able to get it by the weekend, so I called a second store and ordered a case there too. Well, they both came in, so now there are two cases of yogurt sitting in Wichita that I ordered and promised to show up and pay for, and we're over 9 hours away. It's not really possible for either of us to collect in person (I have to work, she's still recovering), and we don't know anyone in town. I don't want to stick these stores with unpaid products that they ordered on good faith for me, and I want to still be able to give my girlfriend this weird (and now belated) birthday surprise. So, if there's anyone in town who is willing and able to pick the yogurt up, pack it appropriately in an insulated container with dry ice or gel packs, and ship it to Minnesota for me, please contact me directly and I'll fill you in on the details. I will cover all your expenses and pay you for your time."|Wichita|2017|False|0

NOAA’s most recent 3-4 week outlook discussion was short and brief.  I translated it from meteorological speak to English. 

They are expecting, based on model guidance, that a ridging pattern will dominate the 2 week period over the central and eastern US. With a trough over the NW. But not a deep trough.  And not a ridge that will drive temps way above average. 

They are confident that a combination of El Niño, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation will be the main drivers for the forecast period. With the other teleconnections not doing anything anomalous to contribute. 

As a skier, looking at the drier than normal conditions, made my stomach drop. However, I did email meteorologists Ryan Knapp from the Mount Washington Observatory regarding a question I had about these 3-4 week outlooks. He told me to take them with a grain of salt because the Climate Prediction Center is making a forecast for the entire country…AND 3-4 weeks out. So although they are good at what they do, it’s hard to get these forecasts right all the time. What meant even more is that “below average” means exactly that. That doesn’t mean, no precipitation. Instead of 1-2 inches of precipitation we may get 0.5” to and inch. That could be up to a foot or more of snow for the mountains.

So don’t be too worried when you see that brown over New England. But I wouldn’t expect a week of Nor’ Easter’s during that period either.  Also, keep your fingers crossed that the ridge over the east doesn’t become too anomalous.  But I don’t think that will happen. 

Thanks!

Thanks!!

Thank you all for your comments.  I've been working in fine dining for the last few years, but will be transitioning back to the legal field after I pass the Wisconsin bar.  My wife is amazingly talented in many things, but is trying to figure out what what she'd like to do professionally.  We do lots of cooking, and play lots of board/card games.  We can't wait to go hit the rails to trails, but biking out here is not nearly as easy as some cities.  Housing wise, we need to stay under 1500/month.

"Hi! I'm a wedding photographer from Iowa and have a couple that is eloping in Door County in June. They have nothing planned beyond that, not even a ""venue"" (for 20ish people). I have never been remotely close to that area. Any heads up or tips are helpful for small venues or cool outdoor places for a ceremony and to take photos. Want some killer shots! Happy to connect with any WI photographers as well. Thanks in advance.

"So I have 100% Disabled Veteran plates. So far they have been great. I no longer need to ask my doctor to renew my handicap placard and I don't have to pay yearly registration fees. However, I have run into a hiccup. I cannot change the address on them at my local BMV, at least according to the people who work there. Do I really have to submit another form with proof that I am still 100% total and permanent with the VA ( I am, so there is no trouble doing that)?

Does anyone here work at the BMV and is able to share some insight?

Edit: Solved. I was able to update the address on my registration by calling the Ohio BMV's main line. I still have to send a form in to get a copy of the registration with the updated address. I'm buying a new car in the next month, so I will be able to get a new copy with the new car then I guess."|Ohio|2021|False|0

Months ago, I read that Li'l Abner used to be one of the most widely US circulated comic strips/books. However, it uses stereotypes of Ozark people that are part of broader stereotyping of southern mountain people. I read that the author, Al Capp, was from Connecticut, so this confirmed by suspicion that the dialects in the dialogue, e.g. pronouncing *confusing* as *confoosing*, of the characters are not remotely accurate. Do think that Li'l reinforced such stereotyping that most people would regard as cringe? Do people in Arkansas, especially during the height of the strip's popularity, really hate Li'l Abner and its reinforcing of Ozark stereotypes in boarder US culture.|arkansas|2023|False|0

# Quick Stats

**Overall Score - 80%**

**Timeliness** 4/10 - From quote to final install , it took nearly 6 months to complete. It finished November 27th.  This caused us to keep a tile design we weren't perfectly happy with but still found acceptable.  Prevented us from pointing out that the vanity cabinet and drawer design wasn't what we requested, we ultimately are happy with it but we didn't want to wait another one month and half for the correct vanity.  Lastly, caused us to fear asking for micro fixes/changes because we were unsure how much more it would delay the project.

**Communication** 9/10 - Only reason I didn't give a 10 here was because we weren't always sure when to leave our door unlocked so people could get in and work and sometimes crew would show up randomly (random for us) to work even on Sundays which was great.  Also as you can imagine being available over the course of 6 months gets extremely difficult as time drags on.

**Responsiveness** 10/10 - Jeremy would always respond in a timely fashion seemingly no matter what time of day.  There were times he would respond where we wondered why he was still ""working"".

**Quality of work** 9/10 - Mistakes happen, measurements aren't always good, I get it.  Aside from a couple of oversights, the work itself is great.  Even beveled the edges of tile around the shower, which I didn't know was a thing.

# Pros/Cons

**Pros**

1. The quality of work is great.  Very happy with it all
2. Great at coming up with workarounds or alternative designs
3. Gave us a budget for materials which we naturally went over each time an opportunity was given
4. They sent someone to clean once evidently this will happen again but haven't communicated this yet
5. Kept a tarp over-top of the dumpster trailer.  Always put down plastic or rugs to protect the flooring
6. um

**Cons**

1. Installed closet system before cleaning carpets
2. Vanity installed on top of dirty tile (well would have been but I cleaned the area first)
3. Other walls in the house were scratched or bumped, I painted most of them with the left over paint they used
4. Broke our key pad door lock, presumably from the many times the door was slammed closed or just the frequency of use.  Not sure.  But we have to manually lock and unlock it now.
5. Closet could have been measured a bit better we have an awkward light switch cover that is cut so the closet system doesn't overlap it
6. Didn't get the correct vanity, drawers and cabinets aren't really what we asked for.
7. Lost an outlet because the mirrors we wanted would have covered it and there really wasn't anywhere for it to go.  Partly our fault but could have been avoided IMO

# Details

**Timeliness**

Back in late June of 2023 we accepted the quote from Jeremy to complete our bathroom.  We had a tripped planned so he recommended that we not start until we got from our vacation.  Fair enough, easy way to avoid problems early on.  Fast forward to July, we got all our materials picked out.  Paints, tiles, colours, etc etc.   We were told that after everything was ordered and shipped, that it would only take about two weeks to complete the project.  Which we thought was a bit ambitious but hey, maybe he has an awesome crew.  Demolition started in July and things were going smoothly.  Materials start showing up at the house a one man demo team is working day and night, it's going great.

First speed bump, the plumber must be subcontracted, we had a no call no show once.  He had to make a few trips and came back a few times.  It took him maybe 4 days to move some of the piping.  Then he had to come back because the pipes were not in the right spot which caused about another week long delay.  Plumber wasn't very timely and didn't show up when he was supposed to.  Got the work done the same week but it ended up being incorrect which delayed us an entire week. After he fixed the piping.

Second speed bump pops up.  The City notices we are having work done and finds no permit was issued for the work.  We had a wall removed and some plumbing that needed to move.  Which means we need a permit.  Jeremy got this knocked out quickly and the City let them continue working with in about a week and a half, if I remember correctly.

Not sure how or why but the custom vanity took 3 months to be built even though it was supposedly ready by the second month.  It finally installed in the 4 month of the project.

We had added some delay to the project by changing locations for lights and getting thing lined up more appropriately.  Also adding additional lights that weren't planned.  That added about two weeks.  After the tub was installed we noticed that the tile work left a hole in the slab exposed to where we could see the pipes also.  Well, we didn't like that so the tile had to be redone to cover the hole.  We had to wait for the only workers to be free from another job to come back and modify it.

We asked for a sliding door ""barn door"" style.  The door was ""too small"" for the opening but in retrospective, we should have had a door frame extension so the sliding door could be locked and maybe a piece of rubber or something to prevent peeping eyes from where the sliding door doesn't meet the frame work at an angle. [Something like this.](https://imgur.com/EYdXEQQ) [And this.](https://imgur.com/fclbpzy)  We ended up getting a larger door which really isn't the correct solution but it works.  Anyway, the larger door caused two weeks of delay because the first one we ordered was damaged in shipping and then we needed to get a second.

Glass for the shower, these subcontractors were stereotypical.  ""We will be there next week on Monday"", then the next, then the next.  We also had to delay this by an additional week because we saw an issue with the tile work that we wanted corrected.  Unfortunately the one man that Jeremy has was already busy with another job that it took two weeks to correct, which caused another week of delay for the glass to be installed.

There were certainly other delays and I had wish I kept notes or done a better job of remember them all.  Unfortunately there is just too much going on in our lives to be able to be meticulous like that.  Although I wish I had tried to find more time to remember the other smaller delays to share with you folks.

**Communication**

Jeremy did a really great job of keeping us in the loop for when to expect people to show up to the house.  Unfortunately some of the subcontractors didn't show up when we were told they would or would show up on the wrong day at the right time.  Thankfully, we had a working key pad door lock that allowed them to entry when we weren't home.  We would normally catch them with our door camera and let them know the code if they didn't already know it.  Jeremy was always upfront with us about things being delayed or his communication with other subcontractors.  We felt like we were pretty much ""in the know"" for almost everything.  For planning the bathroom he added in his experience with certain things and we went back and forth on the design.  His input was valuable and in the end I think it helped reduce a lot of additional unnecessary costs.  He did admit though, if we were adamant about wanting something, he would do it, but told us it wouldn't be cheap.  For instance, moving a toilet from one side of the room to another.

**Responsiveness**

I separated this because I felt like it should be in a different category on it's owned based from issues that arose randomly.  As when the City inspector came on the wrong day.  Or the plumber showed up but we weren't home and he rushed over from a nearby job site to meet the plumber.  Answering the numerous questions we had during the project.  Getting things scheduled or re-scheduled last second due to whatever reason.  His phone must be implanted in his arm.

**Quality of Work**

Javier is a one man team of absolute master craftsmanship.  Not only did he demo by himself but he did; tiling, dry wall work, concrete cutting and repair, some plumbing for the shower, electrical, carpet, painting, installation of all the things.   He worked alone day in and day out.  No help at all.  Absolute beast.

The people who did the closet were great.  It took maybe 6 people to do our custom closet work in about an hour.  Zero complaints about them.  Haven't noticed a single issue with their stuff yet.

All the plumbing looked good from what I could tell.

The vanity cabinet doors are misaligned, aside from that the real wood of the vanity is nice.  It's very well made and it looks very unique.  We like it.

**Cost**

$40,000 USD because I know you are curious and so would I, if I were you.  

**End**

Ask me anything and I'll answer as best as I can.  I probably forgot to mention something but whatever.  I tried.

Cheers!

"From 102.9 WGO-Minot Facebook Page --

(ND) - This week’s report to Governor Burgum from the White House Coronavirus Task Force places North Dakota in the Red Zone in three of the main categories that the White House uses to determine the severity of COVID-19 across the nation.

All data is compiled and distributed weekly and is presented on a per capita basis so that states can be compared against each other equally.

This week’s report, dated 10/25/2020, contains some strong language from the White House to North Dakota.  In its recommendations to mitigate the spread of the virus, the White House report states, “We remain deeply concerned about the speed of the rapid rise in cases, test positivity, and hospitalizations, as well as the number of long-term care facilities with positive staff members, showing significant and escalating community spread. This expanding community spread is being fueled by silent spread in specific counties that is leading to symptomatic individuals. Finding and stopping both the visible and invisible spread through aggressive community testing is essential.”

The report also states that both North and South Dakota are of particular concern to the White House when it comes to the percentage of the total population that has been infected with the virus. “Efforts must intensify,” the report states. “Both North and South Dakota have the highest percent of the population infected, with documented infections approaching 5% and with the missed silent infections, 20% of the population may have been infected.”

A warning from the report spells out the dangers of indoor gatherings – even small ones. “Indoor gatherings are part of the continued and unrelenting spread. We continue to see community-spread initiated by social friends and family gatherings. People must remember that seemingly uninfected family members and friends may be infected but asymptomatic. Exposure to asymptomatic cases can easily lead to spread as people unmask in private gatherings.”

"The day I was diagnosed with covid I got unnecessarily shitfaced alone in my house. After 5-6 beers, the CDC called and wanted names and phone numbers of everyone I had been in contact with that week. I told them I didn't feel comfortable answering and hung up. Three beers later they called back and I didn't answer.

The next day they called again, and while grilling me, I get another phone call. So being an asshole I tell her I have another call, I have to take this. I pick up and it's Burleigh county.

""We understand you're being difficult. If you don't comply, we'll be forced to come to your home with law enforcement and do a wellness check.""

So. Yeah. All of this could have been avoided if I wasn't a drunken idiot. All it amounted to was me emailing them everyday to tell them I was fine and complying with my quarantine. Now it's over and I haven't heard squat.

So if you get covid be nice to the CDC 😂

"Apologies if this is the wrong sub to post in. My gf and I are headed to Acadia this weekend for the July 4th weekend driving up from NYC and will be at the park from July 1-3rd. Very excited for the trip, been wanting to go to Acadia for quite some time. However, I'm getting worried that the traffic and crowds there will be bad...I'm hearing mixed things about it being bad, but not NYC bad. So I wanted to directly ask the people of the state! Exactly how bad will the traffic be and how crowded? We'll probably be using the bus for the first two days (sat and sun), but I'd like to be able to drive on the last day (monday). I know July 4th is a specific time frame, so any information on the weekend vs the weekday would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  

&nbsp;

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for your helpful comments. I drove there expecting the worst and got the best, at least the best for a holiday weekend. Traffic was not bad at all, like AT ALL (sorry for the caps, but that's how surprised I was that there was no traffic). Starting early around 8am each day certainly helped. I ended up skipping the island explorer bus and just driving around in our car. I did all of the ""popular"" hikes first thing in the morning to skip the crowds and that definitely helped. Did Beehive first thing and while there was a small wait along the iron ladders, I'm sure it was nothing based on the crowd I was seeing as I finished the trail (also beat the sun). Beech Cliff was open and completely empty, as was the rest of the quiet side. Jordan Pond House was packed parking wise, but we were able to get a table pretty quickly (10min for indoors, 20 min for outdoors - I would suggest an outdoor table if you can stand the heat). Views were gorgeous. One tip I would give is that some of the parking lots are tiny, but just wait 10-15 min in your car and one will open up eventually. Also, Smokey's BBQ right outside of the island is DA BOMB for any bbq lovers. Ok, this is getting long, but hope it helps someone someday :)"|Maine|2017|False|0
"Hello Maine. I and 3 of my friends will be visiting from New York this weekend and I would love your advice.

The plan is:

1. Arrive in Millinocket this Saturday night (7/1/17)
2. Sunday we begin hiking by 6:30 AM and finish by 6:30 PM the latest. 
3. We eat and sleep off the long hike.
4. Monday morning head back to New York.

The advice I seek is in step 3 & 4. My hope/plan is to drive at least a couple of hours south on the 95 before going to sleep on Sunday night. That way on Monday we have extra time to spend on sight-seeing or potentially dropping by Boston.

I was hoping you could give me some advice as to where to rest Sunday night based on this [**MAP**](http://i.imgur.com/CuFSoCM.png).

The blue line represents the quickest route home (staying on the 95) and I wouldn't mind resting at any of those towns. I am also not against the idea of staying somewhere along the red line I drew.

Just an interesting city / landscape or any place you think worth checking out/staying the night at.

Finally, we are also interested in having some good lobster. If you can think of any places along this route please let me know.

Thank you.

"I'm moving to Portland with a date of August 1st to August 13th from several states away. Thus far I've been using craigslist and sites like trulia to scope out apartments. However, I've noticed the housing market moves very quickly and there are only very few places available for the time I'm looking for so far.  I'm trying to come up with a viable plan for visiting and securing an apartment but the speed at which places are rented makes me unsure of the timing. 

My plan is, when places do become available for the dates I need, to call and arrange a showing and then my SO will drive to Portland to see them. We are thinking he could stay a weekend and see as many places as he can and secure one in this time. From the looks of it, he may not be able to do this until mid July (for example most apartment listings up now are for July 1st or available now) and so it makes us in a serious time crunch for getting it all sorted out. 

For those with experience or knowledge about how renting works in Portland, does this sound like a feesible plan or will we screw ourselves? How much time/how early should we call for showings, how competitive are places? What are the chances by the time my SO makes it out to look at places, it will already be taken? Any other advice you may have? 

When I've moved somewhere from out of state before it was easy to secure an apartment several months in advance without even needing to see it in person or sign papers before move in day, and they certainly didn't ask for references or credit checks.  Portland seems more fast paced and has more rental requirements, so I'm just not sure how to navigate it all. 

Thanks in advance!"|Maine|2017|False|0
"the idea was floated a few years ago to consolidate Lewiston/Auburn and by doing so would make it a near-rival of Portland in population. but it stalled out for a variety of reasons, one being that culturally/politically Lewiston and Auburn are very different.

but what if Maine consolidated the Portland-area municipalities? they all tend to be culturally and politically similar. here's what a consolidated Portland might look like combining Portland, South Portland, Westbrook, Cape Elizabeth and Falmouth:

-A population of 133,000~, roughly around the 200th biggest city in the United States (currently Portland is ranked #530).
-A land size of about 92 sq. miles
-A density of about 1,437 people / sq mile

It'd be less dense than Orlando, roughly the size (population and land area) of Waco, TX - and actually, Waco's metro area population is about the same as Portland's, too.

Orlando and Waco each have 6 city councilors and, yet, Orlando is more than triple the popluation of Portland, Waco about double. Portland currently has 9 on city council. Combined, all the Portland-area municipalities considered in this merger currently have 37 councilors governing. THIRTY SEVEN! 

Wouldn't it be easier to solve the housing crisis, infrastructure issues and future development of the Portland region if everyone was officially working together? The municipal savings, political expediency, marketing/attractiveness, and infrastructure would improve immensely. And, unlike with Lewiston/Auburn, it's not like you are trying to marry right and left, more like marrying left and left so there is no political-party advantage either way

Portland would go from the 29th biggest city in New England to the 6th- much more indicative of it's current economic power and attractiveness as a growing city. just a thought

EDIT: i'm well aware of the make-up of the communities mentioned. very well aware that C.E. and Falmouth would (somehow) stick their noses even higher in the air at the mention of this- that brings in to doubt the feasibility of such a plan, but not the merits. having ALSO been to many medium-sized cities (100,000 - 250,000) i know that such ""different"" communities like Falmouth and South Portland can be governed under one roof, and when you compare to the socio-economic diversity of medium sized cities it would make a consolidated Portland look VERY homogenized (thus, ""politically and culturally similar""- a notion that seems wack when you are zoomed in, but zoom out and compare that to other cities and you'll see its actually very similar). this post is mostly about showing that a consolidated Portland is not very radical when compared to other cities in the country. In fact, it fits in almost perfectly in population, size and density with other places. so, if cities in the midwest and west can function governing a city just as physically big with just as many people and actually be GROWING, why can't Portland?"|Maine|2017|False|0

I live in a highly vaccinated area in the north. We don’t have much covid here anymore. We don’t have a mask mandate but most people wear them anyway in public. 

So why are people down there really rejecting the vaccine? At first I thought it was continued covid denial, but now with the delta variant  it’s gotten pretty hard to think that’s still the case. Considering these people are now taking medication for farm animals as a preemptive measure for covid, it can’t be denial anymore.

"Everyone was beautiful, in their most cute festival-wear.  It was the standard outing, pretty much how you can picture any major sell-out fest running these days is exactly how it went down.

The beards were perfect, the dresses colorful, the PBR flowed like it was a frat party in 1986.

I got there at 1pm for Diarhhea Planet thinking it was a totally different band.  The name elicits such visceral imagery I could have sworn they were some kickass pyschpunkextremeprotocore group, but no it was some Warped tour glitz pop punk with four, count 'em, FOUR guitarists and a bassist all playing power chords and taking turns doing solos and making rockstar faces while they creamed their pants and took themselves way too seriously.  Boring, generic, and mindless.

The middle sets of bands were such a snooze that I have managed to successfully block them from my mind already.  I have vague memories of Courtney Love-esque vocals and a Fleetwood Mac grunge cover band.  Everyone seemed mildly thrilled to at least be outside on a nice day.

I thought Parquet Courts were going to be a highlight, but at that point I'd already heard 67 guitar solos and was done with rock music entirely as a genre, so I just couldn't get into them either.  Unknown Mortal Orchestra turned out to be one of the more entertaining sets, but I found myself spacing out during them too and wondering why I even came out.

I couldn't tell if Ween were doing Grateful Dead or Phish covers.  The crowd was too baked to be able to tell either.

Lame Impala put on their most tame performance yet, and I was worried the band was going to fall asleep to their own generic space rock theatrics.  To remind everyone they were actually at a live show, they blasted a bunch of streamers and confetti multiple times that will probably kill at least a few fish or birds.  Their perfect hair and Aussie accents made it worth the $60 ticket, though.

This is what happens when a cynical asshole goes to a mainstream rock fest.  I should have known better.

The best moment was when a dude dropped his fresh PBR on the ground, puncturing it and making it spew everywhere.  The crowd chanted ""Shotgun it!"" and ""Chug!"" and the dude abided and killed that beer in a moment any capitalist would have been proud of."|Portland|2016|False|0

"Roo: Chihuahua mix, tan/white

Missing 8/28/2018 about 6PM

11 year old spayed female with slight scarring on front legs and larger scar on rear flank

Has a heart murmer

No tags and no chip

Is dog aggressive to the point of barking and charging- no biting

Is usually a bit people shy

Loves car rides

Please help me. I've made a terrible series of mistakes/carelessness and now I've lost my best friend, my emotional support animal and my fur child. I have a Jeep Wrangler and the windows are off. My dog Roo loves to stick her head/neck out of the rear window (it's lower on Jeeps/the seat is higher). 

I took her in my Jeep from Midval heading to Riverton. We traveled out of our neighborhood West down 7200 S and turned South on State Street. The last time I believe I saw her stick her head out was about 8000 S State. I continued on State to 12300 S and turned West heading to Riverton. I look back in my side mirror pretty frequently to watch her when she sticks her head out. She hadn't in a while, but sometimes she doesn't when the wind is in her face. I finally turned around to check on her when I was on 12300 S and about 2000 W. 

She wasn't in the back seat. This is my worst nightmare, I keep thinking I'll wake up. She must have leaned too far and then fallen. This was around 6PM. I called a few people for help and we've been driving the route I took for hours, I finally quit when it was dark. I believe she is alive because we didn't see any sign of a hit animal on the roads. 

I have a harness and leash strapped to my roll bar- I should have strapped her in.

I have always wanted to get her chipped and was actually going to do it next month, though I told myself that often. She's always with me.

I shouldn't have had my music blasting so I could have maybe heard her fall out. 

I should have checked back on her often so I could have noticed if she fell earlier.

I was beyond careless but nobody could love this little girl more than me. She isn't a dog to me, she is my child. I would give anything to fix even one of the mistakes I made causing me to lose her. She gets cold pretty easily, I'm so worried about her being cold, scared, lonely and hungry. I adopted her from the Humane society about 4-5 years ago. She had been in the shelters for about a year. I promised her that I'd always take care of her and she'd never be alone again.

I looked for her, I called SL County animal services (they only wanted to transfer me to Riverton). I left a message with Riverton animal services and called a number they provided on their voicemail which I think was county emergency dispatch. The word has gone out on my social media but I don't have many friends or family. 

Please help me in any way you can. Please share this on social media, or let me know what else I can do. Please keep your eye out for her in any of these areas: Midvale, Sandy, Draper, Riverton.

I know I made so many mistakes but she has a happy home here and I'd give anything to have her back. I need to know that she's not out there by herself. She is such a very good girl.

All I have to offer is $300 for her return or direct information leading to her return.

These are some pictures of her: Roo, Chihuahua mix 12lbs Missing 9/28/18 https://imgur.com/gallery/xHkHSqI

At the moment, I can only seem to find it at actual dry ice regional distributers, and they require a minimum order of 30 pounds or something, waaaay more than I could use. "|Connecticut|2018|False|0

Hey you crazy Canberra people. 

As you're so crazy, why not go out on a winter's day?

#What will be there?

* Soup 

(I'm planning a barley based soup, and a pumpkin soup. Any dietary requirements, let me know)

* Freshly cooked bread

(Any dietary requirements, let me know)

* Music

(Love a jam session, but I will bring a bluetooth speaker)

* Stimulating conversation

* Some shelter

* 12 Volt Power

* Fresh Water

* Maybe a fire barrel


* All of you sexy, sexy people, and some of your friends

#What won't be there

* Chairs

Bring a camp chair.  I can bring a few, but I'm expecting you to bring your own.

* Bad attitude

* Alcohol sales

We're going to be in a public place.  If you want to bring a drink along, all well and good.  Don't be silly about it, though.

* Rubbish

We're all grown up enough to clean up after ourselves, I'm sure.

what are the unique restaurants in the area/restaurants that shouldn't be missed?

Between the rock climbing gyms around central CT which ones are the best?

For social things, are there sports leagues for the town, or should I look for something closer to a bigger town (E.g. New Britain)? I'm a fan of ultimate frisbee but am down to learn other sports. 

I also enjoy Magic the Gathering but I'm just okay at it (i.e. play with friends and a beer, not competitively) and would love a shop to go play once in a while.

"I am glad I rejoined the Independent Party because I am learning about all kinds of corruption in our elections and the CT GOP this year. For all they scream about Democrats cheating...

Michelle Botelho is a Conservative Independent Party member. More conservative than candidates our Independent Party usually nominates but understood the GOP was corrupt and joined our party.

She did not have as good of a chance at winning the Waterbury Caucus for the 5th congressional race against Jahana Hayes as other Independent Candidates might have.

She didn't get a fair chance though and lost the nomination by about 10 votes to Republican Candidate George Logan.

George Logan from the CT GOP challenged her for the Independent Party ballot line. Apparently, the assistant chair of the Independent Party in Waterbury, Laurence DePillo, is in Stefanowki's back pocket.

In addition to the slimy practice of Republicans joining the Independent party on purpose just to vote for CT GOP members to get a second ballot line, this time Logan made it extra obvious.

When Logan announced he secured the Independent Party line on the ballot he said in his announcement, ""Our team worked hard on the grassroots level to earn the required support needed at the caucus"" 

Logan conveniently left out that one of the Republicans that joined and crashed the Independent Party to vote for him at the caucus was his own wife!

We need CT leg to make a law limiting candidates to ONE LINE ONLY in a race or they'll never leave our party alone. :(

"Hoping the friendly people in this sub will assist me with a query.

I own a rental property in the Darwin CBD and am having a long-running discussion with the tenant about the price of their power bill. Long story short, there was a problem with the aircon, which was fixed, but the tenant is now claiming their power bill is still too high.

I have an open mind about it, and want to hear about other peoples' actual real-life experiences.

So, if you don't mind telling me, how much do you pay per quarter for electricity in the CBD? Please let me know the type of dwelling and number of people.

I'd really love to hear from people who are couples in relatively new 2x2 apartments, as that will give me the closest data to the current situation. But also happy to hear details from other situations, anything will help.

Thanks a lot in advance!

"Hi all,  
So I've lived in Alaska for the majority of my life, grew up here even, but yet have never had the opportunity to visit some of the beautiful sights we have up here. My Alaskan life consisted mostly of being in either Anchorage or the Matsu Valley, and I'm looking to finally explore the rest of the state now that I'm older and capable of independent travel.   
I don't mind if any of the places you recommend are only accessible by air or sea, I'll just figure out a way to get there some other day. In the meantime, anywhere that can be accessed by car from Anchorage would be amazing (duration and distance won't matter too much).

Here are some places I already have in mind for visiting:

* Wood-Tikchik National Park, Kobuk Valley National Park, Katmai National Park (for The Valley of 10000 Smokes).
* The Great Kobuk Sand Dunes, The Nogahabara Sand Dunes.
* Illiamna Lake, Lake Clark, Becharof Lake, Lake Louise, Terror Lake (it sounds cool).
* Kotzebue, Nome, Little Diomede, Utqiagvik, Delta Junction.

A friend of mine has some job opportunities in Bethel and King Salmon.

Of course everything is going to be much more expensive, but we'd like to do some math on whether the advertised salary and COLA would be sufficient.

How do people find places to live in very small communities like King Salmon? Is there a facebook group we could look at to see how much rents run around there?

"Hi all, 

I've been given a transfer from England to Oklahoma and have to give my decision in over the next week. 

I'm feeling quite uneasy as I'm a British Indian (Asian Indian) with quite visibly Indian attributes and brown skin, I'm seriously concerned about the prospect of racism, which I've never ever faced in England.

Additionally, I have no understanding of gun culture, which really, is my **biggest concern**. 

I can take some racial slurs on the chin, but being around guns is just something I've never had to live with. I've never been confronted with a gun in England, nor any of the places that I've travelled to in Europe.

With constant reporting of: mass shootings, gun crime and racism in the USA, by British news outlets anyway, with a *police officer* in Oklahoma being recorded saying that he wanted to string up black people, I'm just feeling slightly... off, about the whole thing.

Hey y'all,

I've posted this on some of the local college pages and not sure if this is allowed here, but I'm a college student and my boss and I are looking to start hiring / training some people for next summer. Its a Direct Sales job for a local business in OKC and Tulsa, we hire almost exclusively college students to come and sell for us, this year we hired a bunch from OU and ORU, and we had a lot of success. Feel free to ask general questions here or DM me for more details. The job pays anywhere from 5-8K per month depending on how hard you work.

Sales is not for everyone, but it provides a ton of opportunity to learn, we do direct trainings every day during the summer with some of the best salesmen in the industry. My main goal though, is to provide financial freedom and opportunity to other students/ young people. We are not hiring everyone who applies, but anyone who can work hard and has basic social skills should be able to succeed. 

The reason we are hiring now is because there is some pre-summer training that can really help you make more money, and there are recruiting incentives, like a free cruise to mexico in the spring with the team.

Thanks everyone for your time, if you know anyone 18 or older that needs a summer job, feel free to direct them here, or DM me for other ways to contact us. "|Oklahoma|2023|False|0

2. Mountain biking in the same area: not looking for anything challenging like the (double) black diamond trails right on Mount Major, something like flowy blues and greens will be about right.

"Beware  of the Spectrum / Charter Direct Sales Rep who is canvassing  southern NH to ""win back"" former Spectrum customers who recently  switched to Fidium Fiber. Last week, he knocked on my door and won me  back to Spectrum with the promise of 300 Mbps in both directions -- down  and up. The price was good for what I perceived would be better speeds  than Fidium (I had 250 down and up with Fidium), so I made the switch back to Spectrum. As soon as I activated my new Spectrum internet  service, I ran a speed test and was getting about 300 down and only 9  up; I called Spectrum tech, as well as visited our Spectrum store in  Keene, and both service reps told me that 300 Mbps in both directions is impossible with Spectrum -- they don't offer this combination of speeds at all. I've called and  emailed the salesman for three days to follow up, and his only response was an  email saying, ""I'm not pleased that you're experiencing less than  perfect results. I'll check into this today and get back to you as soon  as possible."" In other words, he framed the problem as if I'm not happy  with ""less than perfect"" speeds, when the problem is actually that he misled me about the upload speed. I can't say whether he is blatantly deceptive or merely misinformed; regardless, the outcome is the same: I  switched back to Spectrum under false pretenses. tldr; BE CAREFUL if you talk to the Spectrum / Charter salesman who is canvassing southern NH -- you will not get the upload speeds he promises."|NewHampshire|2023|False|0

"There was a post a while back about possibly getting some of us Denver ladies in our 30's/40's together & this post is follow up to that. I absolutely & 100% understand the woes & complexities of logistics, so I am being the change I wish to see and posting this here for anyone who falls into this category. We all know not everyone who responds shows up & vice versa, though that's why I'm going with a large, outdoor open space (also my partner is extremely COVID cautious, which I suppose keeps life interesting, but also mostly very lonely). 

Anyhow, deets! 

Who: 30's/40's female-identifying Denverites (of course friends, pets, relatives, SO's, younger/older folks, are all welcome too, though just know & respect that you won't be the focal point!) 

What: Picnic fun -- bring a game, bring a snack or drink to share (I'll have a tray or two of light munchies minimally, so no worries if that's not in your capacity), bring a blanket, bring music, bring nothing but yourself -- it's all good whatever you decide. 

Where: Cheeseman Park, South Side (near 8th ave across from Little Cheeseman -- I'll bring signs & wear a big pink hat though please DM if you're lost!!) 

When: Sunday, September 3 between 1-3 pm. If things are hoppin' I'm happy to go later. If it's enough of a success, maybe we will try this again next month! I'm not a super early person though will do my best to be maybe 5-ish mins early. Again, DM if you are lost & can't find me.  

Why: There is obviously enough interest & need, and I already spend enough time at Cheeseman on my own anyway. 

I'll re-post as we get closer to Sunday. Ladies, let's do this thing!"|Denver|2023|False|0

Is this the usual case when calling for your snap benefit interview? Or do you think it’s longer now because of the massive call volume they’re receiving due to the current health crisis.

"It's currently 80.2ºF in my apartment but only about 50ºF and sunny outside. I get that, at this point, in Chicago, there is no guarantee we won't be in for more cold nights before June and city ordinance requires the building maintainers to maintain certain minimum temperatures, but it's become quite uncomfortable inside.

Are there any easy solutions that don't require installing custom hardware?

"Hey, I am cross posting to r/DND & r/DungeonWorld in hopes of finding people interested in playing tabletop/rpgs on a weekly or bi-weekly basis in the city. As far as I know, the only place with sufficient tables and free space is Dice Dojo but thats way up on the north side and only on Wednesdays (correct me if I'm wrong though.) While Dice Dojo is really great space, its sort of out of the way for a lot of people. 
I work at a cafe and we have a ton of table space, and are trying to start regular community events (FOR FREE) to make use of the space at nights (7-9pm). Some of the staff had talked about doing D&D or tabletop game night, to go with our potential lineup of Yoga, Movie night, ""ambient synth night"" and some other stuff. 
I know a lot of people have trouble finding either a group to play with, a space to meet regularly, or simply the tablespace for this. So I'm here to survey potential interest in a weekly or bi-weekly night, FOR FREE, at our shop. I'm not going to say the name unless we actually start it up, as I dont want this to come off as promotion. 
I'd like to stress that you don't need to have a group, though you can bring a group and just make use of our tables. My hopes for the event is to make it a communal game space for RPG/tabletop on a semi regular basis. We are located on the West side, so perhaps a bit easier to get to than Dice Dojo.

"Hi Reddit, just got an apartment for the first time and am feeling cautious because I watch way too much Judge Judy but what is the low down on making sure you keep your bond at the end of the lease?

I have taken an insane amount of photos of the place before I moved my things in and the real estate has given me till Thursday to return my condition report but all of their comments are very vague and photos not detailed/good lighting.

Do I:

A: Only return the condition report with my comments and keep my photos to myself

B: Return condition report with my comments and print out some photos, not all to hand in to the real estate, keeping the rest of the photos to myself

C: Return condition report with my comments and give real estate a usb with all of my photos

A friend has also moved out at the same time and they are doing Option A but I was really wondering about Option C but my only qualm is that if the real estate see how detailed I am, then they will be extremely detailed at the end of my lease, though naturally after a year of living there would be expectation of normal wear and tear.
I fear this especially because on the condition report I have now, all of their comments are extremely vague and their photos are not detailed or well lit.

I was hoping some of the amazing people here might consider signing and sharing this petition I started, which affects all pet owners Australia wide (Even if you aren’t in Australia, your support means the world).

It’s at over 1600 signatures now, and I’m planning to action it early next month. But I’d love to see it climb past 2500 before I do:

Pets across Australia are at risk of theft and loss, and the microchipping/registration system here is broken.

"Hey guys,

Last week, I went to Hairhouse Warehouse (Civic) to get my nose pierced. A couple of days into it, and my nose started to swell (as expected), however, the stud had started to sink into my nose!! Gross, I know! This is when I realised that the piercer at Hairhouse Warehouse had used a nose screw stud instead of an ""L"" shaped stud.

For reference, the L shaped stud is used for fresh piercings as it allows the stud to creep out if swelling extends beyond the size of the stud. The nose screw stud is kept in place regardless of how much swelling occurs. These are supposed to be used after the piercing has healed.

The swelling started at night so there were no piercers or doctors open this late to get it out for me. Sure enough, the next morning a layer of skin had started to form over the stud.

I instantly went to get it out at Hairhouse Warehouse, but the piercer wasn't in. So, I went to see the piercer at Redpaths. Because I was still able to push it out just enough to see the gem, he was able to take it out for me, cleanly and easily.

After also seeing a doctor, I was prescribed with antibiotic treatment to reduce the infection.

After going back in to Hairhouse Warehouse, to notify them of what had happened, they didn't seem to want to compensate me for the drama or money spent on damages, or even slightly care whatsoever, but rather, placed the blame on me and I was told that ""I am allergic to surgical steel."" Which is untrue as I have more than one surgical steel earring currently in my ear, causing no issues.

The biggest problem was denying they used the wrong stud (nose screw), and claiming that this is the standard; meaning they will continue to use these studs on clients, causing potentially much worse problems.

So if you're thinking of getting a piercing, drawing on experience, I would 100% NOT recommend Hairhouse Warehouse ((Civic) I can't speak for any other locations).

I've had several piercings at Redpaths (including a nose piercing once), all of which I've had no problems with - 100% recommend

Tl;dr: Hairhouse Warehouse in Civic pierced my nose with a nose screw, causing it to sink into my nose + become infected. Told me it was because I am allergic to surgical steel, despite all the surgical steel earrings I currently have"|canberra|2017|False|0

"I'm working on grading my lawn and I'm not sure if I can pull dirt from the back area of my property. About a quarter acre of it is swamp, and the other three quarters of an acre is land that gets soggy easily and has a lot of those phragmites (reeds). Once it warms up I can drive my tractor back there no problem (except the small swamp). It sounds like from the EGLE website below that I can't touch the back without a permit, but I have family members saying I can pull dirt from it. According to them, the big no-no is filling the swamp or causing water to drain into a neighbor's property.

"A family member of mine was arrested for driving under the influence. Both of his parents had died earlier this month and he was driving home after sorting things at their house when someone saw his driving and called the cops. They showed up while he was sitting in front of his house with the car still running. He refused the breathalyzer and they took him in to the station. He works an hour and a half away and desperately needs his job to support his ailing wife. It was his first offense and he has no criminal history.

"I moved here from Florida.  Not that I enjoyed it but I'd describe the driving style of most Floridians as either too fast or too slow and with an almost enviable lack of consideration of others and general ignorance.  I can't tell you how many times I almost wished I didn't use my blinker to signal intent because of how many assholes see it as an opportunity to make sure you can't merge by blocking you in.  

Now I'm here and yeah, I've seen the ""Massholes"".  However, I've also had this weird thing happen to me like once or twice a week.  I will be at a stop sign, waiting to enter a two lane road (double yellow stripe style) and a driver on the two lane will come up with their blinker on, stop before making their turn, and then flash their lights or try waving at me to ""let me go.""  A. I can barely see you through the glare and dust on your windscreen.  B. If I hesitate and pull out too late and you run into me, who would be at fault? And 3, can you just make the fucking turn and get out of everyone's way? I feel like there is a reason cars don't have a way to signal that you are relinquishing your right of way lol.

"Good morning! 

Yesterday morning I went and hiked the Marlboro Trail @ Monadnock, and I found a trekking pole that someone left behind.

If you were there yesterday morning (1/28/23) and lost a trekking pole, please message me and I will easily be able to confirm if it is yours.

"In Florida I know a landlord can't just threaten to throw a tenant out. Most of the time the process is more costly than is worth. The only time I've ever seen it happen was from a landlord whose wife was a millionaire.

My dog is a 70lb husky mix who is healthy with good stamina.

I have the hikes listed below penciled in (criteria of out-and back or loop, dog friendly, can be completed in one day). If there are other suggestions, I'm glad to hear them!

"Hey redditors, at about 4pm today a friend of mine was walking to her car from the Botanical Garden and was approached and chased by a man rummaging through the garbage cans around 11th/12th and York in Cap Hill. She described the guy as follows: 

- a white man in his early 40s
- shirtless
- wearing khaki pants
- very dirty
- either severely mentally ill or on drugs

Upon seeing her, this gent shouted ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT, SYLVIA?"" and began to run towards her, at which point my friend ran to her car and took off (I should note that this woman's name is not Sylvia). Apparently, the dude chased her all the way to her car. Luckily, my friend was a good bit faster than this guy. 

Anyways, she's since alerted DPD, but I thought I'd post on here to warn others."|Denver|2016|False|0

"Hi /r/Denver, 

My boyfriend and I were just out walking our dog when a man drove up and stopped his car & turned on his hazards next to the sidewalk we were on to get our attention. He said that he was just a few blocks down the street and saw a stray dog that looked like ours and was curious enough to think that the stray he had seen was the dog we were now walking. He kept asking us questions about the stray and whether there were signs up for it, to which we said there is another missing black dog in the area but assured him that this dog belongs to us. He then turned down the street and circled back around to find us again walking into our apartment because it seemed like he wanted to see where we lived. 

This guy may or may not have had bad intentions. But we genuinely cannot figure out why he did this. It seems like he was trying to accuse us of taking the stray dog, or he wanted to get a look at our dog. Has anyone at all heard of this happening around Denver, or does this just seem like a one time thing?

Edit: In case anybody is genuinely curious, this happened at 14th & Humboldt and the guy was driving an older white Ford Taurus-looking vehicle."|Denver|2016|False|0
"My brother had his  [adorable little husky puppy](http://imgur.com/rjwb5ux) ~~stolen~~ taken today around 4 o'clock from in front of their house on the corner of Hope ct. and McElwain. We have surveillance footage of a car pulling up calling to her, and driving away with her, but it's awful quality. [This is the best shot i could take of the car.](http://imgur.com/lqFScK0) (taken from a phone of a monitor, sorry) Hard to tell make or model, even color is questionable, we think it's maroon-ish.

She broke out of the yard a few minutes before the car showed up. and by the time anyone noticed anything, they were long gone. 

If i can find a way to upload the video i will, but the dvr is old, and doesn't seem to have the capability to do so.  And a phone recording of a bad quality cctv recording probably won't be of much help. 

Any information about, or help with this will be greatly appreciated as the family is all pretty distraught over this, not to mention husky pups are not cheap. We're checking craigslist, shelters etc.  but are having no luck. Thanks for reading.

We are budgeting for a house somewhere around 200-225k and would like to be close enough to a higher population area with access to some nice bars and restaurants. We don’t particularly want to be IN the city but on the outskirts with a short commute. We love being on the coast but don’t particularly need to be near the ocean. We’ve lived in multiple smaller cities around Boston and love the lifestyle and the fast pace. We also spent nearly a year living in an RV and are okay with a small house.

"Anyone local to the 757 area dealing with this too?

So I’m a 28 year old male, andI had covid during the New Year, it took me about 2 weeks before I was well enough to return to work, and about another 2 weeks to feel like my normal self again.  Fast forward a couple months to mid April, and I started feeling.. off.  

Chest pains, elevated resting heart rate, brain fog, fatigue, vision impairment just to name a few.  After going to the Norfolk General ER because of the chest pains/elevated heart rate, all results and blood work came back fine.  I scheduled an appt with my Primary doctor the next week, and had some standard blood work ups done, and everything came back fine as well.

"I grew up in a wonderful area of southern Utah County called Elk Ridge. Part of the appeal was being right at the base of the mountains surrounded by incredible scenery and wildlife.  Our yard is often visited by deer and elk and it was a huge reason why my parents decided to live there.

 Some of the city’s residents however hate deer and wildlife coming into their yards and have complained to the city council.   Consequently, they have decided to do a round up and slaughter of these beautiful creatures over the month of August. It’s beyond me that anyone would move to an area such as this and feel like the local wildlife is encroaching on them.  

 This is cruel and unnecessary, and while I know conservation does include the occasional culling of animals, this is driven by a few who feel annoyed from living along side these creatures.   Not wanting to start a debate but for those of you who feel like the problem is us and not them, I would encourage you to please sign this petition asking for this to be stopped.](https://chng.it/DjCyR4hzPg)"|Utah|2023|False|0

"My wife and I are currently in search of a rental to live in near Lehi, where my new job is located. We are open to living slightly outside of the city or in a nearby city if it offers more affordable rentals and I can commute to work. We have a small dog and cat as pets.

"TL;dr - Looking for a residential structural engineer and/or a contractor that can/will remove a wall and perhaps install some cabinetry/countertops, both of which would be around 10 feet long. Recommendations? Tips for how or where I should be looking? Area of service: 46218.

Recently purchased a home and am looking for a general contractor to remove a small wall. I've never needed a general contractor before, so I don't know any that specialize in what I'm looking for. I've done some searching online, but most contractors either don't have pages/sites/profiles with much information at all, or market themselves as doing jobs like complete remodels and other much larger jobs, so it's hard to tell if they'd be interested or charge reasonably to remove 10 feet of wall (and maybe install some countertop).

Pretty much the same story for the structural engineer; very few listings come up from a cursory google (yelp, angieslist, etc.) search and those that do don't have any info regarding their business, like where they serve, their insurance status, contracts, etc. 

I definitely plan to start calling the businesses that have appeared to find more information - as I realize that's likely just how this industry works - but I wanted to see if the subreddit had any suggestions for me on either front. 

Note: I realize I need both, not an either/or, but I figure if I can find one that I like, they might have recommendations for the other, so I'll take whatever lead you have."|Indianapolis|2019|False|0

"Hey guys,

I'm happy to say that I'll be starting a job as an entry level engineer in Huntsville! I'll be moving in about a month, and I'm starting my apartment search now. I'm looking for something decent for no more than $900 a month, and I'm finding that Madison and South/East Huntsville have the best looking postings in that range. Where would be the best place to go as a young engineer?"|HuntsvilleAlabama|2016|False|0
"The last two times I have gone to the Redstone PX, they have been sold out of the very popular green Federal Supply Service Notebooks. I also need a 6 ring binder for some loose leaf rite-in-the-rain paper and none of the office supply stores that I talked to on the phone appear to carry them.

Is there anyone out there who I can buy either of these things from ASAP? I leave TDY for an extended duration starting Tuesday.

Thanks!"|HuntsvilleAlabama|2016|False|0

"Hello everyone,

I grew up in Green River, Wyoming from 1986-2005.  During my last year there, I got in a lot of trouble with the law.  I took some plea deals and after 15 years of not being that person anymore, I am looking to get these things taken off my record.  

I've looked at the Wyoming State Bar website and called a few of the recommendations on there but the few I called told me they don't handle expungements.  Does anyone know of any attorneys or has anyone done the process themselves?"|wyoming|2020|False|0

I just signed a lease for a new apartment (which is super exciting!!) that has electric heating. It’s not baseboard, more like I a little vent in the wall and every room has its own thermostat. I have only ever lived places with an HVAC before so I’m not sure how much the electric bill is going to be in the colder months. The apartment is 1000 square feet... any ideas at what I could be looking at for electricity bills on a monthly basis?|wyoming|2020|False|0
Hello everyone I was thinking about moving to Wyoming from North Carolina. I’m 22 years old and working as a land surveyor. I was curious if anyone knows how the job market would be for my line of work? I’ve been working on roadways and mainly construction. I would appreciate any info on things like cost of living, quality of life, housing, and opportunities. Only thing I really know about Wyoming is there’s a serious lack of people and beautiful scenery which sounds amazing to me, just curious about the overall life and work aspect.

"Renters Rights Violation?

My landlord text me today, asking if I was home after I requested follow up for a repair that was started weeks ago.

The AC unit is going out and they came in at the time (over two weeks ago) and I gave them permission to check it out (screenshot with the white background). They came in, inspected and told me they need to replace it, but were wanting to hear from the owner since the unit was so pricey. They also put in a temporary unit at that time to help cool the house.

However, today… “are you home, this is James from (landlord name).”

I told him no, and he asked me details of the issues and that they’d schedule a time. (Screenshot with black background)

I came home and my door, from my kitchen that goes into my garage was locked, the AC unit was shut off, and the temporary unit was turned to the lowest setting to help cool the house, and my bedroom light was on.

Nothing, that I’ve noticed is missing, but is this not a violation of my privacy and renters right?

Any advice for information, questions to clarify, are appreciated. "|Tennessee|2024|False|0

"I've voted Democrat my entire life, I am pro-environment, pro-worker, pro-education, pro-literacy, but I can't do it anymore. Harris was installed not elected, she never won a single primary and yet the DNC shoved her in after  President Biden lost that debate. You don't have to like a candidate to vote for him, and Trump is more qualified.  
He was in office and we had cheap gas, I bought my first home under his presidency, we had great interest rates, we were at peace. The minute the Democrats got into office, Putin invaded The Ukraine.

Hey yall!!! I doubt there is much to be done, but I am trying to figure out who these people are… This is a postcard picture and is from somewhere in the 1920s or 1930s.

My 3x great grandparents were Clarence Alex Cobb and Allye Irvin Ezell Cobb, and they lived in the area of Indian Mound and Big Rock in Stewart County, Tennessee.

The Environment Dept has lost its status as a Department and has been placed in the Planning and Industry cluster. With the imminent death of NSW Marine Parks, this move has huge ramifications for terrestrial conservation. Watch as National Parks are progressively opened to lobby groups (shooters) and are commercialised - see recent changes to Lane Cove NP. Some of those in prime coastal locations,particularly in southern NSW may be opened for development. The placement of the Environment into a cluster that otherwise manages industry, minerals, water and primary industries (agriculture) and under a National Party minister shows the contempt that this government holds for the environment. This is the party who cheers every time environmental regulations are removed or watered down yet feign shock when a catastrophe like the Murray Darling occurs. Enjoy your National Parks - they will be irrevocably damaged by the end of this term of government. |sydney|2019|False|0

Hi reddit! I started dating an Aussie relatively recently (hence lack of knowledge of all things Aussie and why I still haven’t been there... sorry!) and found he gets homesick sometimes... I’ve lived away from home before... albeit not as far, but know the feeling well. So I wanted to gather things that would remind him of Sydney, where he’s from, or Australia as a surprise gift for the next time he feels this way. We’re in Canada, so anything that I can buy online or in North America would be the most feasible. Thank you! |sydney|2019|True|0

"Dear /r/LosAngeles, 

Recent posts about anticipated emergencies and disasters in L.A. (yipes!) have caused /u/LAFD to loudly wonder:

**Are official disaster plans for the City of Los Angeles in alignment with the thoughts, concerns and beliefs of redditors?**
_______ 
*The Good News...*

The City of Los Angeles [Emergency Management Department](http://www.emergency.lacity.org/) (EMD) is updating its Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP) to help reduce injuries and losses from disasters and ensure that critical services and facilities of the City will continue to function after a disaster. While our City has about 284 sunny days each year, we do face the potential for earthquakes, floods, fires, hazardous materials incidents, power outages, infrastructure failure, transportation accidents and terrorism.

________ 
*The Great News...*

**No one knows Los Angeles better than members of /r/LosAngeles, so we need to hear from you - and our friends at EMD make it easy via a simple survey** that allows you share what concerns you most about potential disasters. /u/LAFD asks you to take this opportunity to let our City leaders know exactly what concerns you before, during or after a disaster. Here's a direct link to the survey: 

**https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CityofLosAngelesLHMPSurvey**

We're not rich, but we make enough to feed our family and don't need the extra $300-ish. We've never had or used SNAP. My understanding is that while this p-ebt program is state-funded, the federal government is reimbursing states for all of it that is used, so I'd hate for it to go to waste.

I'm just looking to see if anyone can shed some light on the process of getting a resident parking sticker for Boston.

Currently, my car has CT plates. It's totally paid off and I'm in the process of getting insurance for the car in the state of Massachusetts and the title is on its way in my name.

As I udnerstand it, once the title is in hand, I can get my insurance and once that insurance is taken care of I can go to the RMV to apply for Mass plates.

Once I've got the Mass plates, I can apply for a resident sticker. Is this right? I've had friends who have said I also need my drivers license to go from a CT one to a Mass one as well but I've not gotten a definitive heads or tails about if this is something that I need to do to get my resident parking thing.

"Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Council Member Jamal Osman met with the Minnesota education commissioner last spring after the department halted federal nutrition funding to an organization now under federal investigation for fraud.

Education Commissioner Heather Mueller said in court documents that she believes the virtual meeting last May was ""the only meeting I've attended with government officials concerning \[the Minnesota Department of Education's\] administration of the USDA food program during the pandemic, Feeding Our Future, or any of Feeding Our Future's sites.""

The Minneapolis officials' involvement in the meeting is disclosed in civil court documents, which are drawing new attention after federal authorities [searched](https://www.startribune.com/fbi-investigates-nonprofit-feeding-our-future-for-alleged-fraud-millions-misused/600137966/?refresh=true) Feeding Our Future's headquarters last week as part of a fraud investigation. The organization and several associated with it are accused in search warrants of misusing federal money meant to provide meals for children in poverty.

A spokesperson for Feeding Our Future denied any wrongdoing on the part of the organization.

Osman founded Stigma-Free International, one of the nonprofits through which authorities allege money in the fraud scheme flowed, but said in a statement that he cut ties with the group before the period outlined in search warrants.

Frey received campaign contributions from six people named in the search warrants. He said he learned of the allegations after search warrants were unsealed last week. The mayor said he does not intend to keep the money and is working with an attorney to determine where he should send it, given the fraud allegations.

If the allegations are true, Frey said, ""it's reprehensible.""

**A virtual meeting**

Feeding Our Future was formed in 2016 and claimed to help community partners participate in the federal nutrition program.

According to court documents, the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) became concerned with the sharp increase in money going to sites sponsored by Feeding Our Future and blocked its funding. The organization sued the department in November 2020, claiming discrimination against a nonprofit that worked with racial minorities.

In May, while Feeding Our Future was challenging the department in civil court, Frey and Osman met with the commissioner and other staff at MDE, according to documents in the case. Frey discussed the meeting in interviews this week. Osman declined interview requests but issued statements.

Both Frey and Osman said they heard from people who were concerned about whether vulnerable people would have adequate access to food. Both said they recalled that the meeting was about federally funded food programs generally, rather than Feeding Our Future specifically.

Emails provided by Frey's office show that in May staff on the city's intergovernmental relations team asked state officials for clarity on whether requirements for the federally funded Summer Food Service Program had changed.

On May 13, a government relations representative for the city emailed MDE thanking them for information about the federal program and said Frey and Osman ""would like a meeting with the Commissioner to discuss this further.""

A virtual meeting was held the next day.

Frey participated in part of the meeting and said he is ""99% sure"" he left early to attend to something else. He later contacted a Star Tribune reporter to say he had corroborated with others present that he had left early.

""I didn't think twice about it,"" said Frey, adding that he frequently talks with state officials about other issues like the coronavirus pandemic and public works projects. ""It is almost the definition of my job to at the very least get additional information and understanding when a community is explaining concern around food shortage.""

Osman said in a statement Friday: ""I was very concerned about hungry kids during the closures of schools. I asked Commissioner Mueller to ensure that all effort was made to have this \[federal\] program feed underserved youth in Minneapolis.""

He added: ""I didn't mention Feeding Our Future or any other organization during the meeting. It was about kids in my ward being hungry.""

An MDE employee, in a deposition filed in court, said she did not recall Feeding Our Future being mentioned specifically but ""the issue of stop payment in general terms did come up.""

The education commissioner, through a spokesperson, declined to comment further.

**Forming a nonprofit**

In 2019, before his seat on the City Council came up for election, Osman and three others incorporated the nonprofit Stigma-Free International Inc., according to business filings first reported by the Sahan Journal. Records filed with the state in October 2020 update the list of incorporators, removing Osman's name and listing three new people .

In the search warrants released last week, federal authorities said Stigma-Free International is ""another company that appears to be fraudulently receiving Federal Child Nutrition Program funds under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future.""

The warrant says: ""Records obtained from U.S. Bank and Bank of America show that Stigma-Free International Inc. received more than $6.5 million from Feeding Our Future since January 2021. Bank records show that none of this money was used to purchase food or meals for underprivileged children.""

In a statement, Osman said that he formed the nonprofit as part of his work to provide businesses with training about crisis mental health responses. He said he ""gave up"" the nonprofit when he decided to run for office in the summer of 2020 and has had no association with it since then.

""While I operated and was associated with Stigma-Free, we never worked in delivering food or meals,"" Osman said. ""We had no association with Feeding Our Future and received no monies from them while I was with the nonprofit.""

Officials with Stigma-Free International — which has since dissolved — could not be reached for comment Friday.

**Donations and an appointment**

Two months after the meeting with the Department of Education, in July 2021, Frey received donations from six people listed in the search warrants.

The donations were logged within days of a fundraiser held at one of the addresses listed in the search warrants.

Frey said it was one of many fundraisers he's held with the Somali community, which has provided key support in his recent elections.

""Just to be very clear, there was no discussion whatsoever of these allegations or of the nature of any of the substance that is addressed in them,"" Frey said. ""As I recall, we talked about safety, police accountability, which was a topic in every fundraiser, and Somali history and politics.""

Each of the donors listed in the search warrants gave $1,000, the maximum amount allowed in a mayoral race each year. The donations represented a small fraction of the roughly $676,000 raised between Jan. 1 and Oct. 26, according to campaign finance reports.

One of those donors, Abdikadir Mohamud, was later appointed to the mayor's community safety work group. Frey said there was not an application process for the group.

""We routinely conduct community engagement and we heard from individuals that were interested,"" Frey said. ""A big part of all these groups was to have diversity of thought and background and so we wanted to ensure some Minneapolis, East African representation.""

Mohamud could not be reached. Frey said Friday that Mohamud is no longer on the group."|Minnesota|2021|False|0

"Use this information how you want.

I know what I will be voting on these 3.


**Edit:**
People are pointing out that if these 3 justices will be voted out, Rick Scott will get to choose 3 new ones. This is correct, and important to keep in mind.

However, according to BallotPedia these justices are relatively conservative to begin with.

If you look at BallotPedia's profiles on them, and scroll to the bottom, you see a score that was created by 2 professors at Stanford University. The score is an indication of how Liberal or Conservative Supreme Court Justices are.

Anything below 0 indicates a more liberal leaning judge, and anything above 0 indicates a more conservative leaning judge. The average score of Florida's Justices is a 0.51.

Canady scores a 0.87. [source](https://ballotpedia.org/Charles_Canady)

Labarga scores a 0.5. [source](https://ballotpedia.org/Jorge_Labarga)

Polston scores a 0.83. [source](https://ballotpedia.org/Ricky_Polston)

Of course this information is still rather limited in comparison to what we get on political candidates, but it is an indication of their ideologies.

Combining the facts that they voted that Amendment 1 was OK, are too conservative **for my taste**, and have already served their initial terms, I don't see much reason to keep these guys on the bench.

**Edit 2:**
In the [2015 case regarding gerrymandering](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article47576450.html) that came before these Justices, the following [final opinions of the court](http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2015/sc14-1905_Final_Opinion.pdf) are notable:

Polston **fully dissagreed** with the majority verdict of the court to adopt the district map *drawn by the opponents of the gerrymandering.*

Canady **partially dissagreed** with the majority verdict to adopt the non-gerrymandering map.

And Labarga **agreed** with the majority verdict to adopt the non-gerrymandering map.

"I made mistake of getting an apartment near freeway before I realized it can cause soot to accumulate inside and bottom of feet. Luckily windows and balcony dont face freeway however balcony rails def collect soot. Inside is not so bad after a deep clean.

I have central AC and It Gets too cold if I'm always running AC and I like to have leave window/balcony door open at night to be honest the air feels fresh and nice and cool and inside doesnt seem to get bad as a result of it.

I run A/C on my days off from 12pm-3pm when its hot. Thats all. So I'm not gettin much bang for buck on air filter on AC doing anything. I dont really like the AC on otherwise gets too chilly but I would consider if it makes a big difference in air quality.

My new idea is... What if I set the fan on my central AC controller to ON always instead of auto? Would the fans help filter some air? Does it push air through the same AC filter? I can leave fan all day with windows shut when i'm at work id fan would be helpful.

I have a house plant, may get more... considering an air purifier (altho I have zero allergies and this seems to be more aimed at allergens than black soot stuff?)

"I haven’t seen a post about it on the subreddit yet, so here it is (so no one is caught unaware). Sorry for the wall of text in advance. If you want the TL; DR, go here: [http://wvmetronews.com/2019/01/28/w-va-educators-ask-for-a-say-so-but-senate-votes-to-bypass-committee-on-bill/](http://wvmetronews.com/2019/01/28/w-va-educators-ask-for-a-say-so-but-senate-votes-to-bypass-committee-on-bill/)

The WV Senate railroaded a bill through today that is being referred to as the omnibus bill. The bill is 144 pages long according to some sources, and Sen. Rucker (who is charge of the finance committee) said the draft was just finished Thursday. When the committee discussed the bill earlier, she shut down any ability to discuss it with constituents. She also admitted that out of state lobbyists for private corporations that run charter schools were consulted in writing the bill, but it appears they didn’t even try to consult any educators.

Some of the things apparently in the bill (since they’ve been so quick about this, the text wasn’t even online as of a couple hours ago... and still might not be):
- Charter schools EDIT - Public Charter schools with their own local advisory boards that function like a BOE
- Vouchers (done in such a way that a parent could claim they were going to homeschool, get the cash, then enroll the student back into public schools a month later... keeping the money while the school gets nothing added to their own budget for said student) - EDIT - apparently they have to return some portion of it. It’s not clear how much, though.
- Larger class sizes for elementary (raised to 28, I believe) EDIT - 31, with 3 exceptions (meaning up to 34). I believe this is for K-3... I could only imagine the horror of 34 kids that young with one teacher.
- Seniority neutered by saying it isn’t the only thing used to determine RIFs anymore
- Big one here - we essentially become at-will employees who can be fired without cause at the discretion of our principal without cause (so, essentially, losing tenure) - EDIT - seeking clarification on this; some portions of the bill are just now being read through, and some changes don’t make a lot of sense.
- Paycheck “protection” - this is the requirement where teachers have to reenroll in their union every year. It was written by ALEC as a way of decreasing union participation in places where there was still strength despite right to work laws. In reality, all it takes is a phone call for me to stop union dues (which means I’m protected enough, thank you). This would require going to the board once a year to fill out paperwork again. Imagine having to do that for a utility every year. It’s nonsense, and they had no answers to the challenges like this last year - it’s just trampling my free speech by telling me what I’m allowed to do with my money supporting a perfectly legal organization.



My union had heard whispers for a while and offered to share their thoughts and those of affiliated teachers with Rucker. She declined.

The committee was not given enough time to discuss it before it was passed along party lines. It was then supposed to go to the finance committee (since, you know, the GOP is supposed to be all about fiscal responsibility AND railed on and on last year about how it’s irresponsible to pass bills without knowing how much they’ll cost). After announcing that, Carmichael decided instead to have the bill pulled from committee straight to the senate floor WITHOUT any idea of how much it will cost. 

This action has only been done twice in the state’s history, and shows just how desperate they are to railroad it through. 

The bill does include a couple of good things, but is written in a way that says any changes invalidates the whole bill. There is another 5% raise (laughable they’d give us another guaranteed 5% on top of last year’s raise without a lot of virtue signaling over the ability of the state to afford these actions), for example. Essentially, they’re giving us poison dipped in sugar.

Edit - fixing some information that was clarified at a meeting this evening. With how quick this is going through, there’s lot of misinformation we’ve been given."|WestVirginia|2018|False|0

Hello All, backstory… my best friend since I was 13yrs old is going through some things. We’re in our 30’s now. She’s had to send her children to their grandparents. Her oldest is a teenager (15/f) and now lives in Boise next to me instead of Texas (all she knows). Her mom is still in the other state. I must be out of the loop… everything I suggest to do with her sounds lame. Skate? Bowling? Movies?…. I don’t have kids but she’s my priority right now since I am her only friend currently. Until school starts. So wtf do you do with a teenager in Boise/Nampa/Caldwell anywhere ?!! Clubs ?! Summer program?! I need suggestions please and thank you! |Boise|2024|False|0
"Hi fellow Boise redditors, question for you. I live in a neighborhood that does not have an HOA, and while I love the perks of it (ability to park camper, no micromanaging HOA members, etc,) it’s apparent that there are some drawbacks to it. One being the lack of sidewalk maintenance on walks (there are multiple areas that I have to walk on the street with the baby’s stroller to avoid the overgrowth of weeds- and poor pup got some embedded cheatgrass in his paw last year that needed a pricey vet procedure ), as well as some residents letting their yard become overgrown with weeds. I’m not talking mild to moderate lack of lawn care maintenance, but extreme to where the weeds are waist level or higher. They are not my neighbor but it is something that I see from time to time as that house is directly near the entrance to the neighborhood. Another time we had random chickens in our backyard, which took a half a day to find out who the owners were. We do eventually want to get a new house but we are sort of locked in due to high costs and interest rates for the time being. We know our neighbors around us but not familiar with much more of the neighborhood as it is expansive. What are your thoughts on HOAs? Are there areas that have reputable HOAs or are they all a pain? Is there anything the city can do for maintenance of the sidewalks or is that a responsibility of the owner? Mostly I just want to avoid all that dang cheatgrass. Thanks in advance!

"My father has had the Whipple surgery--not due to cancer, but instead a large benign mass in a very bad location. He did very well at first and even gained but had complications 6 months out and is on an even more restricted diet to prevent further issues. 

He is currently on a ""low residue/low fiber"" diet and struggling to keep weight on.

I have to be quick since I'm off to work soon. I'll check back when I'm off this afternoon. Anyways, I'm a 26 year old girl, conservation degree, and I'm really set on moving to CT. I don't have much tying me down here except my job, which is I can manage with. I've done some research and understand that compared to where I'm at now (Minneapolis), there's a higher cost of living out there. I know that's all relative though. Looking around online can only get me so far, so I thought I'd get a more ""personable"" experience asking those who live out there. I had some questions that maybe you could help me out with - 

* Cities/towns/suburbs to look into that may be cheaper to live in (apartments), but are still close to business that will pay well.
* Tips on pursuing an environmental career in CT
* Local resources that help with relocating
* Average cost of apartments, daily living expenses etc. 
* Any other advice you're willing to give is much appreciated

Thanks! Hope everyone is off to a good Friday!

"As I went to vote this past primary, I was notified I was labeled ""u"", and unable to vote that day - but instead I registered again for democractic. To my surprise, but maybe I thought somehow - somewhere I was de registered as a democrat - or that it was my fault. Well, today, along with a few other hundred people who were registered democrats as well, I find my friend who had put a video up on YouTube calling bullshit - as he, and a few other hundred people had been with the same problem and unable to vote in the primary. Along with him, and many others in starting to think this was on purpose. Anyone else run into this problem this past primary Election Day? 

Edit: not first time happening: This was done in person at the town hall for me, I remember specifically because I had missed the checkbox for the parties so then I was given it back and I checked the box.  Which I had done back when I voted in the last presidential election as well, but. I thought somehow voting registration ran out, so I went back to reregister and luckily I did because I wasn't identified as a dem or republican - and thus it still happened, this was less then a year ago. So I'm very suspicious.

"You're all probably sick of questions like this, lol. The secret of your beautiful state becoming more and more known, eager people from all over the country looking to live there. I'm no exception. I'm your typical Midwesterner who swears I'll move south every winter. Now I'm looking to actually do it, if you can bear with me as I try to survive your summers and ask dumb questions. (It all depends on job placement really, but if I were to get the ball rolling, I want to be thinking about it.) 

I'm in my mid-20's, single, outdoorsy, and artsy/crafty. Pretty extroverted. I also like bars, board games, bowling, and casual softball leagues. Just to give an idea of the kind of person I am. I know your state will have a lot to offer in terms of exploring, hiking, experiencing the ocean, seeing the mountains, the whole shebang. 

\-For people in my age range who have moved to North Carolina, how easy was it to meet people and make friends? Any advice on how/where to do that? 

\-Would someone accustomed to a large metropolitan area be happy in a place like Asheville? Or am I bound to get bored there after some time?

\-What about between Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and Durham? I know there are college enclaves, but my party days are long over. I'm looking for areas/places that cater to people 25-30 and up. What are the bad areas? What about the wealthy areas, that I should be certain I'll never be able to afford rent in? 

\-What about finding decent places to rent in general? Roommates? Would love to live alone but expensive places make it hard. I'm trying to be vague, but the area I'm currently in has an insane housing market, both buying and renting, and from my understanding NC's is a lot better. Is this true or is the grass just always greener?

\-Are there people here who have moved to NC from the upper Midwest? Did you miss our terrible winters at all? Will I survive the summer, and what should I expect? 

\-For those of you who are annoyed with people trying to move to your state (I get it, I get it), what do you wish they knew? What is there not to love about your state that you would use to dissuade someone from moving there? 

\-I'm sorry for the generalization, but are people in the south truly friendlier? I know it's a giant region with lots of cultural differences. But I've heard you all are way kinder than we are up here (we pretty much ignore strangers/don't interact with each other).

"I am expecting to accept an offer next week in the Triangle and I'm curious about off-roading in NC? I'm from Colorado and used to:

* Narrow trails
* Little to no mud
* Lots of rocks
* Switchbacks up a mountain - usually unknown if it's a real trail or a dead end
* Trails can be 90% something a Civic can do and 10% of the trail you need a Rubicon
* About 10-20% chance you'd ever get reception anywhere in the Rockies off-roading
* I'd say 60-70% trails you need a high clearance 4x4 and 10-15% you need lockers
* Winch can be useless when above the tree-line and our high altitude trees are too thin to hold the weight of most vehicles 
* Full size trucks are handicaped due to size on trails 
* I've definitely had to back down a trail 1000's of feet since I couldn't turn around anywhere

Can someone give me an idea of what vehicle/terrain NC off-roading looks like? Can I get by with a Subaru Outback or do I want a Rubicon? Do I want 42"" mud boggers or some 31"" AT's get me where I need to go? 

Finally will these trails lead to awesome camp sites? Or do they just kinda loop around with a million dirt bikes flying around it endlessly?

"Greetings Chicago redditors! 

Can you help me out? 

This is the third time I’ve stopped at Union Station for a transfer and I am determined to leave the station this time. I have always been afraid to miss my train but I am getting disgusted with myself for not trying...I’ve got the kid with me, and I want to explore even just a little bit of the city today. 

I do have more than 2 hours but we cannot miss our train so I’m calling it 2 hours to err on the side of safety. Our ETA for Union Station is 10:45. Our next train leaves at 2pm. Do we have enough time to cab over from Union station to millennium park, spend a few minutes at each landmark (long enough to see the fountain spit at least one time!!) and make it back without running around like a maniac? 

Are there cabs at Union station? And where should I ask to be dropped off to see the Bean + Fountain? 
Also, would there be cabs around to make it back to Union Station or should I just ask the cab who brings us there to come back in 30/40 minutes? Sorry for so many questions! 

Any tips on how to make this work or if it is even plausible are so very much appreciated. 

Please don’t April Fools me!! Haha

My kid is even more fascinated with Reddit since I told him I could ask for advice on here. “It’s even better than google mom” 
Thanks guys!!!
•••••••••

ETA: we did a fly-by through Millennium Park. Hung around the bean and got some great photos, then walked to the playground which ate up the rest of our time. I was assured we could find a taxi to get back but the area looked so desolate from the park that I still left early to give us time in case we’d have to walk back. Of course we got a cab right away....

My son and I both really loved it!! Thank you so much to everyone for your suggestions and advice. I replied the same in a couple comments below but I guess it bears repeating...we are from NYC and my son is very loyal to and obsessed with where we live. But he kept remarking as we walked around “Chicago is such a better city!” And that “Chicago does everything NY does but better. Except the cold. And the pizza.” 😂

"Hi, I’m Joey Stanley, a linguistics grad student from the University of Georgia doing research on English accents in the US. I did a survey over facebook last year and through another account ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/7c1v7j/casual_english_vowel_sounds_native_english/)) and got several hundred people to take it, but only 4 were from South Carolina. So I thought I'd come here to see if you could help me out.

If you have 5 minutes, please consider taking [this survey](https://ugeorgia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2lqEd8yULAUDoQB?Q_CHL=social&Q_SocialSource=reddit) about how you say certain words. It is brief (less than 5 minutes) and is open to native English speakers regardless of where you're from. 

Thanks,

Joey

[Edit (May 29): Thank you all for taking the survey! I apologize for not posting the results yet and I know I said I'd get them out by now. I just had an overwhelming number of people take the survey, so it's taking me a lot longer to process, but I do plan on sharing the results soon.

"Does anyone else have to do this? context, I live in a share house and we have a slightly annoying process we have to go through when paying our water usage. 

The real estate agent sends us a letter telling us what we owe and the only payment options are by sending a cheque to the real estate or a money order through Aus post. 

It specifically says we cannot pay via BPAY/DEFT which is how we pay them our rent and is also a much easier process.

Just wanted to see if anyone else has to go through this process to pay for their water usage and if there are any other options?"|sydney|2017|False|0

"I've been selling items on KSL Classifieds for years. I am a private seller. I regularly buy upgraded toys, tools, cars, sports and outdoor equipment, etc. I then sell my old items on KSL to recoup a little money from my upgraded purchase. Over the years I have seen hundreds of scam attempts. I keep wondering why these guys are still at it. The only reason I can think of is chilling, *it's working.*

I don't know who it is working on or how they are getting away with it, because there are some pretty obvious red flags with most all of them. Here are a few of the common ones I see.

>how long have you been using it, Do you bought it new, and why are you selling it, I mean no insult...

>I will like to buy it, but I cant make it there with cash or to check it out,I will pay you through PayPal and the freight company will pick up after you receive payment and do you have PayPal account?

* Poor English
* Say they want to pay via PayPal, Cashiers Check, Money Order or through KSL
* State they want to buy the item at full price without ever seeing it
* Say they will have a 3rd party pick it up

>Kindly get back to [NAME] via email at [NAME0000547t98s5@SOMEEMAIL.com] with your firm price she's interested in buying your [exact item description]

* Email address nobody would actually have
* Asking you to email them, which gives them your personal email instead of using the KSL filter
* Copy/Paste of your exact title, an indication they are mass texting every new item that gets posted
* Phone number is from the other side of the country (not always a sign since people do relocate, but it can be a minor flag)

These are just a couple examples, but most scams follow these basic patterns. They all look different, but there are a lot of similarities. Here are a few rules of thumb that can help out A LOT. These are not all mine, but they are tried and true:

* If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is
* If you wouldn't do it as a buyer, be skeptical of someone else being willing to do it (buy without seeing, paying more than its worth, etc)
* Deal in cash

I would hope that nobody would fall for these scams anymore. If you have additional tips and experience, please share. Good luck out there. Happy selling."|Utah|2017|False|0

It is #14.  I can't identify the artist but apparently it was done in 1992 and presented to John ""Turtle"" Baker, who must have done something special for Hardin-Simmons.  The photos are all the information I have on it.

Come to find out they Do not pay drive time and I couldn't even clock in until we hit the TxDot office in Abilene, so I find out that I am now going to be riding in a company vehicle going to a job for free, two and half hours there and two and half hours back.

I'm a 23 year old Japanese American male and I am going to be studying abroad at Deakin University from July to October. I was curious to know what are some things I should do during my time in Melbourne! I'm open to a lot of things: music fesitvals, food, sports, concerts, etc. 

I was hoping for less touristy things but if you recommend that then by all means! Trying to get the most of my time while I'm visiting. :) I'm also looking to get a tattoo done of some tribal and Japanese style tattoos, so if you know a good shop leave a comment for that too! 

I also have questions for you all:
How is cost of living compared to California? 
Is it hard to find friends being an international student?
If I wanted to sign up for a mobile plan, how much would it be for data and messaging? Any good plans out there?
Recommendations for neighborhoods to live in? (I was looking for nearby campus)

Genuinely curious about this, I knew it was coming but didn’t realize it was coming so quickly. From what little I’ve been able to glean, it sound like it will be run by some sort of joint cooperation between the lottery commission and the casinos? Will you be able to place bets anywhere you buy lottery tickets? Who sets the lines? Are the limits to the types of wagers and sports they are allowing you to bet on? I’ve been to Vegas many times and the sports books there are nuts, seemingly any possible occurrence in any conceivable sporting event, if they can out odds on it, they’ll let you bet on it. I assume it will be at least somewhat more regulated here and not allow for the kinds of crazy prop bets you see elsewhere?|Connecticut|2021|False|0

I have family members looking to relocate to the Huntsville area this fall. They are very concerned with finding a church home similar to where they attend in the Seattle area. They describe themselves as left-wing evangelical. Currently they attend an Evangelical Covenant Church but there aren’t any local churches affiliated with that denomination. Multiethnic, intergenerational, and mission driven would be their most important criteria. Is there anywhere in Huntsville that fits this ideology? They are visiting me in a few weeks and I would like to take them somewhere that might fit their wishes.|HuntsvilleAlabama|2022|False|0

"Hey there,

I’m the person who asked what is was like for trans ppl in South Dakota. Definitely staying away from rural areas, but I think Rapid City should be ok for people like me. I don’t really have a choice in moving haha, so I’ll have to go to SD either way.

Anyways, for people who go to WDT, what’s it like? What programs/majors are you in? How do you like them? Are there other trade schools near Rapid City that you’d suggest?

Any advice would be appreciated :) I’m thinking of going into a construction major/program. I’ve always loved doing stuff hands on and especially building stuff. Ever since I started masonry classes in HS, I’ve been set on going to a trade school. Eventually once I graduate trade school I’m hoping to be a carpenter. Or something like that.

"G’day Again Slagicals,

&nbsp; 

About a fortnight ago, [the r/Sydney community voted for the subreddit to restrict posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/14cwkp9/rsydney_community_protest_vote_results/) in order to protest Reddit’s well-known API changes.

&nbsp;

Reddit continues to fail to negotiate in good faith regarding API access, and have been happy to coerce subreddits to reopen. In particular, [major concerns remain regarding disability access features.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ixy1z/update_on_reddits_plans_for_moderation/) Over 2,400 subreddits remain in a protest state, at the time of writing, including a number of large and location-based subreddits. [r/Sydney’s traffic remains down 75% or more](https://imgur.com/a/8uxeBTw), and if other protesting subreddits experience similar declines, this should be reducing Reddit’s advertising revenues, which we hope shall end up bringing them to the table.

&nbsp;

However, this protest will not keep going without the continued support of the community. As such, we are asking you to vote again on the direction /r/sydney will take next.

&nbsp;

To vote, you’ll need to have at least 500 total subreddit karma, and have created your Reddit account on or before 08/06/2023. This is a measure to ensure that the vote is cast by participants within the r/Sydney community. Naturally, it's one vote per Redditor only.

&nbsp;

The question is:

&nbsp;

Should r/Sydney’s participation in the protest action continue?

&nbsp;

Please vote by responding as a top-level comment with one of the following two words only:

&nbsp;

**Yes** – you want the subreddit to continue to restrict posts, with a Daily Thread open for commentary until 17:00 AEST 15^th July.

&nbsp; 

**No** – you want the subreddit to re-open ASAP.

&nbsp; 

This post shall remain open until 20:00 AEST 30^th June, and results will be announced 17:00 AEST Saturday, 1^st July.

&nbsp; 

AutoModerator will validate and count votes, and remove all comments to keep the secrecy of the ballot. **If your comment includes anything besides the word Yes or No, AutoModerator will not be able to count your vote.**

&nbsp; 

There’s only two positions on this ballot, so majority rules.


&nbsp;

Should the community vote Yes, we shall release another poll asking for the community's stance before 17:00, 15^th July.

&nbsp;

It's sad that we find ourselves in a position where further action needs to continue, but this remains an important issue.


&nbsp;

Stay Slagical,

&nbsp;

The /r/Sydney Mods."|sydney|2023|False|0

"G’day Again Slagicals,

&nbsp; 

As the 48-hour Reddit blackout enters its 6th day, just under 5,000 subreddits continue the protest, and r/Sydney is one of them.

&nbsp;

[While Reddit is unwilling to make reasonable concessions regarding API access, disability accessibility, effective moderation, and research tools,](https://imgur.com/E7jSWf1) many subreddits have chosen to continue protest action. It is clear, for the moment, that Reddit has no intention of negotiating in good faith. [With that said, however, traffic on r/Sydney has declined over 75% since the start of the protest,](https://imgur.com/a/8FFeFbS) [and posts and comments sitewide have taken a hit of approximately 10% based on a graph we’ve seen.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1118623581899853965/1119053784228835411/image.png) It is our hope that declines in traffic will bring Reddit to the table in the near future.

&nbsp;

However, this protest will not continue without the continued support of the community. As such, we are asking you to vote on the direction /r/sydney will take next.

&nbsp;

To vote, you’ll need to have at least 500 total subreddit karma, and have created your Reddit account on or before 08/06/2023. This is a measure to ensure that the vote is cast by participants within the r/Sydney community. Only one vote per Redditor shall be accepted.

&nbsp;

The question is:

&nbsp;

**Should r/Sydney Close (go private) until 17:00 AEST 1^st July, Restrict (with Daily threads open only) until 17:00 AEST 1^st July, or re-Open forthwith?**

&nbsp;

Please vote by responding as a top-level comment with one of the following three words only:

&nbsp;

**Close** – you want the subreddit to go private until 17:00 AEST 1^st July.

&nbsp; 

**Restrict** – you want the subreddit to go restrict posts, with a Daily Thread open for commentary until 17:00 AEST 1^st July.

&nbsp; 

**Open** – you want the subreddit to re-open ASAP.

&nbsp; 

This post shall remain open until 20:00 AEST Sunday, 18^th June, and results will be announced 08:00 AEST Monday, 19^th June.

&nbsp; 

AutoModerator will validate and count votes, and remove all comments to keep the secrecy of the ballot. To assist AutoModerator with this, please only put the word of your vote in your comment.

&nbsp; 

If any position takes a majority of the ballot, it will be declared the winner.

&nbsp;

If no position takes a majority, but votes to “Close” and “Restrict” take a majority of the ballot between them, then “Restrict” shall be declared the winner. This is to prevent vote-splitting amongst those in the community that wants further action taken.

&nbsp;

Should the community vote to ""Close"" or ""Restrict,"" we shall release a second poll asking for the community's stance at 17:00, 1^st July.

&nbsp;

It's sad that we find ourselves in a position where further action even needs contemplation, but this is an important issue.

Much Love,

Your Slagical Mod Team."|sydney|2023|False|0

"A Police officer on Rt 66, stepped into my traffic lane and forced me to pull over. He stated that someone had complained about my driving and would I comply to a sobriety test. IU complied and passed and he said would I comply to a breathalyzer, knowing I had not been drinking( that day in my mind) I complied and blew over on the hand unit - apparently from my previous evenings hard drinking-I was at a celebration until 5 AM - the traffic stop was in the around 2 PM the next day. Ultimately, I was convicted of a DUI 1 for a BAC of .1 or .02 over the legal limit- in January of 2017. I enrolled, prior to my conviction, in a 28 day in house treatment program at the premier facility on the east coast, Ashley, formerly known as Father Martin Ashley (at a cost to me of $50,000.00,)as allowed by Virginia law. Upon completion of my treatment, on the date my case went before the court, I was convicted of a DUI 1 for driving with a BAC of .1 and my lawyer, without informing me of the ramifications, (i.e. once a restricted license is obtained one forfeits the option of simply not driving for a year), obtained for me a restricted drivers license. I was convicted placed on 1 year unsupervised probation and interlock requirement and as required went to ASAP and had a breathalyzer installed. Due to false readings, (the first in the parking lot of the installation, the 2nd 30 minutes later, 8 false positives in the first 6 months), I was violated by ASAP probation near the end of the interlock requirement period, even though 7 were deemed false positives by the commission one lock out was considered legitimate, I assume. I returned to court where the judge found in my favor.- sort of, no fines or jail, but another 6 months interlock. The machine was provided by Alcolock, the Company that was removed from Fairfax counties list of state sponsored interlock providers while it was still in my car, for undisclosed, to the public, reason. I discovered documents on Virginias own site regarding potential rules changes, that it was due the machines not being in compliance with existing VA requirements from the inception of their implementation, and were notorious for giving false readings. I was never given permission to remove the device, however, due in large part due to the issues it gave me, and my ASAP officers inability to schedule me for the 20 required classes for ASAP completion-(she instead made me do 2 different and costly interviews with state sponsored alcohol assessment companies, event though I had preemptively put myself into treatment, and as such had completed that requirement)- I had not been able to work and my car was repossessed. It is worth noting that at my first violation hearing, that even though the judge agreed that it was the machine, imposed no penalty upon me financially, or on a sentence to jail, I was somehow found to be in violation on the interlock issue, and as such, I was required to keep it 6 months Long story short, over the next month there were a couple of false positives - not lockouts, but ""wait 15 minutes and try again"" messages on the unit, and disgusted, unemployed, and despondent, I determined to stop driving until the 6 months was over., I was not informed of violations by my ASAP officer that any violations had occurred and as I was not using the car for the duration of the 6 months imposed upon me at the violation hearing, with the exception of taking the car to the alcolock center for monthly calibration as required by law, when the 6 months were up I called my ASAP officer to inquire about how I could have the unit removed. She got back to me a few days later and ""Sorry I have been ill and out of the office. It appears you had 3 violations which occurred 4 months ago so I am goin to violate you."" I went to court as required in August- the original hear had been continued from June, on the appointed day for the violation hearing but my attorney had a medical emergency (without my knowledge until a month later) and did not show up to the hearing. As covid was roaring through the prisons, and as I , a 52 year old that had almost died of flu/pneumonia/strep lung infection (I spent 40 days in in Reston Hospital isolation ward in Sept/Oct2017) and as such I have lung scaring and am in the age group at higher level of death from covid, there was no way i was going to chance going to jail because my lawyer was not there to defend me and potentially die from a near certain infection of covid. At the second hearing I was found guilty, fined $250 and my restricted license was revoked. My lawyer said pay it and it is over, which I did. However I have now received a letter from DMV telling me I have to do ASAP. AGAIN. I want all of this to end and think mthe original stop should not have been allowed in the first place.

article appended for non-subscribers.

It was true. Viola Allen’s dream home sits atop a nightmare. The city of New Orleans built 67 ranch-style houses on a sprawling former garbage dump in the late 1970s without saying a word to the Black, mostly first-time home buyers who were encouraged to move there by city officials. Under the untreated soil where the new residents planted fruit trees, grew flower gardens and watched their children play in the dirt were 149 toxic contaminants, 49 of them linked to cancer, according to an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The saga of 57 families living on the former Agriculture Street Landfill in the Gordon Plaza housing subdivision is considered by many to be one of the worst examples of environmental injustice in the United States.

The boundaries of the old landfill were certified as a Superfund site in 1994. And now, nearly three decades after residents finally learned they were living on deadly ground, government officials have refused their demand to be relocated from homes that lost their appeal and nearly all of their value. The properties are almost impossible to sell because of the contamination, said Akeem, who was 11 when EPA officials and environmental experts visited his mom that day in 1993.

Even more audacious, lawyers and advocates for the homeowners say, is that after residents were originally awarded a $90 million state court judgment against the city — which approved the construction — officials have refused to pay. The housing authority, which funded the development with federal dollars, and the public school system, which built an elementary school at the site well after the contamination was revealed, have also refused to pay their share of the damages.

An obscure Louisiana law shields municipalities from being forced to pay damages, attorneys said. Earlier this month, a judge reaffirmed a 2006 court decision but agreed with an appellate court’s decision to lower the damages, awarding $75 million to a class of 5,000 plaintiffs. Lawyers said they doubt that the plaintiffs will ever see a dime.

“This case is a living example of the need for environmental justice. And it screams out as an example of environmental racism,” said Suzette Bagneris, the lead attorney for the class.

“The residents of the Agriculture Street Landfill were hard-working, honest folks who worked multiple jobs trying to attain the American Dream of homeownership, only to suffer an American nightmare when the very soil under their homes literally started to kill them.”

It’s yet another challenge that the Biden administration has taken on in its bid to right historic wrongs done to underprivileged communities disproportionately burdened by pollution.

The solution for Gordon Plaza is far more difficult than the successes the administration has achieved so far. Last May, the administration shut down an error-prone oil and gas refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands that dumped oil on people of color. That same month, the administration influenced the city of Chicago to conduct a lengthy environmental impact assessment as officials mulled whether to allow an industrial metal scrapyard to operate in a Mexican American area already teeming with industrial pollution sites. The permit was denied in February.

During his “Journey to Justice” tour in November, EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited Gordon Plaza and spoke with homeowners. They reminded him that his agency was a major part of the problem.

Before the EPA warned Allen and her neighbors that the ground where they raised their families was toxic, it spent nine years telling them it was safe. Between 1986 and 1993, the EPA reassessed how it categorized toxicity of a number of contaminants and finally deemed that the Agriculture Street Landfill site was unsafe.

As federal and local officials stood by, cancer became a fact of life for the people there. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry discovered a breast cancer cluster and reported that Black women in the Agriculture Street Landfill census tract had a 57 percent excess risk of breast cancer over nine years, ending in 1997. More recently, a 2019 report by the Louisiana Tumor Registry found that the census tract where Gordon Plaza sits had the second-highest consistent cancer rate in Louisiana.

It is nearly impossible to link cancer to a toxic substance, so experts could not be definitive about the risk. But residents were terrified.

""Everybody knows somebody in the neighborhood who has cancer and has died from cancer,” said Akeem, who moved away from the area decades ago when he joined the military. He never moved back.

Arsenic and playgrounds

Gordon Plaza was a beacon for Black people who dreamed of owning a home.

Located in a part of New Orleans with a come-hither name, Desire, and a curvy road called Abundance in the Upper Ninth Ward, it dripped with Big Easy charm.

Black people had been excluded from the best neighborhoods by racist housing covenants, redlining and legal racial separation, but this middle-class housing was built especially for them.

As African Americans began to ascend in population and voting power, the city’s White mayor, Victor Schiro, entered into a cooperative agreement with the White-run housing authority in 1967 to plan the new development.

When Press Park apartments and townhomes, a senior living facility, Gordon Plaza and a shopping center were completed in the early 1980s, New Orleans had its first Black mayor, Ernest Nathan “Dutch” Morial.

Morial encouraged his Black constituents, some of whom worked in his own administration, to buy into the dream.

City officials were silent about the bleak history of the 95-acre site selected for construction. But within a few years, the tragic reality became the talk of New Orleans.

Shannon Rainey realized something was wrong in the early 1990s as she dug a hole behind her house to plant a tree. Her shovel struck a solid object.

“I found a canister in my yard, and it had just a skeleton head on it along with the X,” said Rainey, who worked in a city administrative office under Morial and had inside information about the sale of homes in Gordon Plaza. She knew the X stood for crossbones. “Now I’m breathing toxins every day,” she said.

Nate Parker realized something was wrong when he walked out his front door in the early 1990s and saw a white vapor rising from the soil. “In the morning, my dad would walk and he saw smoke coming from off the ground,” said his daughter, Elaine Parker Gavin.

Parker was a “do the right thing” kind of father who coveted homeownership as a financial legacy for his family, Gavin said. With a shopping center and plans for an elementary school, Parker and other residents felt they had no reason to ever leave their all-inclusive community.

Akeem’s voiced cracked as he talked about his adoptive mother’s reaction after she learned of the contamination, and how the news altered their lives. “She never regrouped,” he said. “She always came to us apologizing. She was, like, ‘I’m killing my kids.’”

Akeem was ordered to stop playing in the yard, and his mom had a new daily chore — wiping away household dust with bleach.

A woman who once focused on the positive became an angry crusader. She dragged Akeem to meetings where environmentalists and health consultants warned residents of the possible effects of living on land saturated with poison: neurological disorder, memory loss, stomach ailments and more, Akeem said.

Studies have linked arsenic toxicity to Alzheimer’s disease. “My mom has dementia, the same thing that EPA told them that they can possibly get,” he said.

Then came the tears.

“She doesn’t know who I am. She lives in that same house because she has nowhere else to go.”

Jesse Perkins, born and raised in the Desire Housing Projects, leaped at the chance to buy his first home.

“My mother had never, ever had a home that she actually could call her own,” said Perkins, a retired manager for the city sewage and water board. “So that was everything. I worked so hard, so long, so many hours, day and night, strenuous work, sacrificing and saving my dollars.""

The family planted and ate from a vegetable garden. One day, an environmental activist warned him of the danger. “I knew at that point in time that ... we can’t grow tomatoes here,” Perkins said.

Even Beverly Wright, a professor and environmental expert, was unaware. While she didn’t live at the site, her husband had a pest control contract there.

“I remember him coming home and he would say, ‘Bev, that place is a dump,’” said Wright, founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans.

One day she noticed that his face “had broken out on his forehead with ... little blisters and stuff,” she said. “Even then we did not put it together.”

The swampy 95-acre Agriculture Street Landfill was one of the city’s main resting places for residential and industrial waste. From 1909 until it closed 48 years later, fires constantly erupted. The site was reopened for a year in 1965 to accommodate debris from Hurricane Betsy, up to 300 truckloads per day.

After that the dump was closed, burned, covered with a layer of the city’s incinerator ash and grinded into the earth.

When the homes were built, the foundations were poured onto land with elevated levels of lead, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and arsenic that can cause cancer, heart problems, reduced lung function and developmental problems in children, along with other health disorders.

City officials claimed to have no idea about the extent of the contamination. But after two class-action lawsuits were filed in 1993, and city workers were called to testify for a trial that finally began 12 years later, the depth of their knowledge was revealed.

'An unacceptable risk’

Thousands of people said they were harmed.

Homeowners, cancer patients and children formed one class. Students, teachers and administrators at the Moton Elementary School — which the Orleans Parish School Board built even after consultants explicitly told them the land was dangerous — formed the other.

The classes were joined by Civil District Court Judge Nadine Ramsey. Ramsey did not buy that city officials were unaware of the contamination. In fact, city workers testified that the soil was tested, she wrote.

“As a result...the city required the developer of Gordon Plaza to add topsoil before constructing the homes,” wrote Ramsey. The judge ordered the city to turn over the findings. “The city has never produced a copy of the Gordon Plaza soil testing and has not explained why,"" she wrote.

Before the school board started constructing a school on land it purchased in 1975, its members knew that testing revealed incurable chemical contamination.

At a meeting in 1985, environmental consultants hired by the board advised members “that the site may pose an unacceptable risk of exposure to ... construction crews, schoolchildren and staff,” according to court records.

They recommended excavating three feet of soil at the site and replacing it with at least two feet of fresh topsoil. They also recommended installing a six-to-12-inch clay barrier to separate the topsoil and contaminated soil, and said testing should be routine.

During construction, the clay barrier was eliminated to cut costs. When 900 students entered Moton Elementary in 1986, they lacked that protection.

Wilma Subra, a technical adviser who has worked on numerous EPA Superfund committees, recalled a disturbing experience as she conducted environmental tests at the school.

“You could smell it and feel it,"" Subra said of the toxins, ""on your skin and feel it in your lungs.”

In her scathing judgment, Ramsey described the behavior of city officials as “shocking,” and said the school board’s actions were “particularly offensive and egregious because of its heightened duty in the realm of elementary schoolchildren.

The residents, ""who are some of the most unrepresented in our society, put their trust in the defendants,” who “did nothing as evidence mounted that the former landfill was hazardous.”

Two months after the trial began, Ramsey ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding $90 million in damages. Each person was to receive up to $50,000 for mental stress.

A core group of plaintiffs received up to $105,000 for the diminished value of their homes due to “the stigma associated with being located directly on top of a Superfund site,” court records said.

Viola Allen was awarded $140,000, and Nate Parker was granted $145,000. Another homeowner, Don Harrison Lewis Sr., was awarded $105,000 for lost property value. Diarra Ayodele McCormick, one of hundreds of Moton students, was awarded $40,000.

City officials appealed the decision to the state Supreme Court, which upheld most of the award. But as the city, housing authority and school board ignored the courts, disaster struck.

Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans, drowning the Ninth Ward, including Gordon Plaza, in more than six feet of floodwaters. Residents scattered as far away as Australia.

While they were gone, the Press Park apartments and the senior center were demolished, leaving only Gordon Plaza. Homeowners hoped disaster insurance would end their ordeal, but insurers would not buy homes built on contaminated ground.

Ten years passed before Bagneris and her legal team forced the housing authority’s private insurers to pay a sliver of what it owed in 2015: $14.2 million.

It was a small victory.

Later that year, a New Orleans Times Picayune reporter interviewed Joan Virgil Davis as she opened her court settlement letter. Davis had played in the dirt at Press Park when she was a child. Over 20 years, she fought breast, brain, lung and rectal cancer.

“I watched her go from a woman who walked like a stallion to one who had to be pushed in a wheelchair,” Rainey said.

She unfolded the letter and looked at her reward: $4,843.15.

A year later, Davis died, according to her Boyd Family Funeral Home obituary. She was 59.

'It’s death over there’

By the time Regan, the EPA administrator, stepped out of his black government SUV and took a seat in a circle of residents on Rainey’s front yard, Gordon Plaza’s residents had little faith in government.

But they patiently told their story — including the part about how the EPA misled them.

It started in 1986, when the EPA conducted soil tests at the former landfill. The results were not provided and residents were told the land was safe, court records said.

Later, after the federal toxic substance disease registry found elevated levels of lead and other chemicals, the EPA returned. A second round of tests in 1993 found that 149 toxic contaminants were dangerous.

A majority of residents asked to be relocated. But rather than pay an estimated $12 million for that, the EPA spent $20 million to remediate the soil, swapping a three-foot layer of contaminated dirt for clean dirt in just 10 percent of the development.

Adding to what residents considered an insult, the EPA told homeowners, senior citizens and schoolchildren that it was safe to go about their normal lives when contractors started digging and kicking up enormous clouds of dust.

The workers showed up wearing gas masks and hazmat suits.

“I can remember it like it was yesterday,” Jesse Perkins said. “They were looking like astronauts.”

Outraged, Perkins was one of many homeowners who refused to let contractors touch his property, fearing the dust they created would sicken his family. He believes every level of government — federal, state and local — failed him.

That included Morial, the first Black mayor who rode into office on the votes of a new Black voting majority.

Years later, Marc Morial and Mitch Landrieu, the sons of mayors who governed when the development was new, expressed sympathy for Gordon Plaza residents after becoming mayors themselves. Meanwhile, city lawyers fiercely fought the residents in court and refused to pay damages during their terms.

Mitch Landrieu, now the infrastructure czar for President Biden, did not respond to requests for comment. Marc Morial, president and chief executive of the National Urban League, a civil rights group, said the neighborhood was divided over the relocation effort.

“I’m saying that community leaders right back in the day said we don’t favor a buyout because we don’t want the neighborhood to be destroyed,"" said Marc Morial, whose eight years in office ended in 2002.

The vast majority of residents supported relocation, Bagneris said. Morial eventually supported a relocation, she said, but only after the EPA informed him that the city would be responsible for the $20 million it cost to repair the soil.

Subra said the relocation effort was undermined by the city’s vigorous court fight and hostility toward the EPA. Residents came to share the hostility when the EPA chose to spend $20 million to remove soil, but not people.

Sitting in the sun with Regan, the second African American administrator in EPA history, they wondered what he could do.

The bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress provided $3.5 billion to clean up Superfund sites, and the EPA is now considering another round of soil testing that could finally lead to a relocation.

Regan promised to consider the residents’ demand to be relocated, saying he would consult with Mayor LaToya Cantrell — one in a long line of Black mayors who have expressed sympathy for the residents while fighting them in court. Cantrell declined to comment.

The City Council recently voted to set aside $35 million in the capital budget for Gordon Plaza, but the money is not guaranteed.

For some people who lived in Gordon Plaza, any potential rescue is much too late. Parker Gavin, who moved to Mississippi years ago, said she will never go back.

"Company Name: Labor Loading Hauling Moving and More

My review is longer than Google's 4000 character limit so I'm posting it here. 

Move from Louisville to Radcliff 

I intentionally waited 48 hours to write this review because I was so pissed I wanted time to calm down. However, after playing the whole situation over and over in my head for the past 48 hours the conclusion is that I'm still pissed the FO! 
Secondly I want to comment that in order to be a successful business owner, you must listen to your customers feedback and retrospect. These is one of those moments.
I contacted Dre to get a quote on moving. I told him all of the large items and approximate boxes that needed to be moved. Initially I was going to split the move into two bc half of this 3100 sq.ft house was going in storage. 
Items:
A total of 3 couches and 1 recliner,
1 King bedroom group
1 Queen bedroom group
1Twin bedroom group
1 dresser for the baby
1 Futon
2 desks (one of them a sit-to-stand)
A six cubby hole bookcase
A 3 cubby hole book case
Random wall art (didn't provide the count)
20-40 boxes (turned out to be 44)
And other a couple small mics furniture pieces. 
Mentioned my son's toys and his little kitchen.
A back patio table
A 3 story ferret cage (cleaned)
A charcoal grill (cleaned) 
There were some other smaller mics moving items but this is the gist of it. 
Anyway Dre proceeded to explain his rates one of them.beimg $145/hr for 3 men (pretty high but I thought to myself they've gotten five stars so far...must be worth it) 

Day of move:
I got a text at 10:23am that he was 13 minutes away. Once there I started walking him through the house. Starting with the garage I told him everything that's labeled yellow is storage...90% of storage items were already in the garage ready to go. The bigger furniture items weren't. 
As I was walking.him through the house he started making comments about how I didn't tell him about everything. I was a bit taken by this because I'm a very thorough person...I literally labelled everything in the house to be moved... everything. 
But I didn't want to get off to a bad start so I let it go (1st mistake). 

They got started around 10:55am. 
He said he didn't think we could get everything on the truck. So I asked if I needed to get a 2nd truck...could go to Uhaul but I'd need someone to drive it...he said no problem. 
About an hour in, one of his guys got a terrible phone call that someone close to him had passed. The poor guy just broke down and it was challenging for him to focus. I asked if he needed to take off...we could try to work around it and go from there. But Dre insisted his guy would be okay. I left to get the Uhaul...ended up getting a 17' truck. Returned home and the guy told me he needed to leave...he didn't have a way home so I called/paid for an Uber for him. Cause that's just the type of person I am. The Uber arrived around 12:30 and the guy went home. So now we're down to 2 people instead of 3. Dre said his uncle was on his way...cool.
But in the meantime we started helping to move stuff because I needed to be out of the home before the cleaning people came. And being down one person makes a big difference. 

Okay so his uncle finally arrived and by this time we have about an hour before cleaners arrive. So myself and S/O who has a nerve injury hustled along with Dre and the young lady he brought to move boxes and smaller items. But I noticed that his uncle was kind of slow...but I thought maybe he's just not used to the work and was just helping his nephew out. 

Alright so trucks loaded and we're about 13 minutes passed the time we needed to be out. There were just a few stragglers behind but surely I could get those if they left with the trucks and I catch up with them on the road...wrong! 

Dre then told me that nobody felt comfortable driving the Uhaul. It was pretty much like sorry one of us (me or s/o) would have to drive the uhaul. At that time I'm like WTF...we needed our vehicles to move those straggler items so the cleaners could clean without stuff in their way. 

Dre and his crew left and me and s/o took about 20 minutes to try and figure out WTF to do. Bottomed line was we would have to come back to Louisville and things really started to go south there. 

By the time we left, we got caught in 30 minutes of traffic...you'll see where I'm going with this. I drove the Uhaul while the s/o took the pets and baby in the SUV.

By this time Dre and his crew had about a 50 minute lead on us. 

When I was 10 minutes from the destination in Radcliff I get a call from Dre asking where the place was. My immediate thought was how did we catch up with them when they had a 50 minute lead???

At any rate, they got into the house and started unloading. When I got to the house 10 minutes later my family and I start unloading the 2nd truck (Uhaul). 
But as I'm taking stuff into the house I'm noticing that the uncle was constantly taking ""breaks"" while everyone else was moving things in. I even watched the facial expression from the young lady that was moving the boxes like 'dude wtf are you doing?' 
My sister-in-law arrived...great we have more help. But as we are moving things in we're just looking like WTF...this guy is not really helping. He's standing around and talking a lot!! 

Fast forward, we got done and headed to the storage which was 4 minutes away. 
We let them in storage and they unload while we run to the bank and get some food. When we got back they were pretty much done (6:45pm) then that's when all hell broke loose. 

The price I was quote had almost trippled. 
I nearly lost it and asked how? Dre said 9 hours...I'm 10:45-6:45 isn't 9 hours it's actually 8 and it would've gone a lot faster but we were down a man for almost two hours then the uncle who came to replace was barely doing anything mutha@#$&en thing!!!!!!! 
I said.you know we've had some unforeseen situations...he said like what? 
I'm thinking WTF!!!! So I had to remind him that we lost his first guy, and started helping to get done and how his uncle stood around. Then he said his uncle took a quick break...he can't take a break?
Okay so I will admit I lost it. I literally lost my temper because I was being played! I couldn't believe it. I thought surely as a business owner you should be mindful of these things. But nope. 
The argument got pretty intense and I realized nothing was going to change and that I was going to end up taking this loss. 
He made some eff'd up comment about how we would've broken our backs moving stuff if they didn't help and insulted my s/o size. Im like the &$## do you think we got all that furniture in our home originally? No one helped us. Lol
In addition to that my daughters and myself have literally moved our entire household from State to State by ourselves with no help from a man what so mother@#$en ever!!! 

So why did I decide to hire movers this time? Uhh let's see I have a tumor in my left shoulder and like I said my s/o had nerve damage in his arm. But we had to move sh!t anyway!!

It all ended badly, I was appauled that Dre couldn't admit the situation was wrong and was so on the defense without listening to what his customers were saying. 

I almost left without paying...but that's not how I do business...that's not who I am
So I took the loss, paid and left. 
Oh and those cleaners that was supposed to clean my house said they couldn't clean bc the stragglers behind. So that pretty much ruined the rest of my weekend.. photographer was supposed to come on Friday, house put on the market, open house on Sunday...all...not... happening. 
So I really got screwed. Dre sent a text apologizing how things had ended but at this point I didn't give a @#$&. He got my $50 deposit, $1491 plus I paid $30 to get his first guy home. (I was originally quoted $628.)
I got completely...100% F@#$ed!!!!!!

Never a mother@#$&en again will I hire a ##$en mover!!! I...a woman have done this sh!t many times before with no help. This was a useless waste if time and money.

So yeah this was a very long post but I want you all to have all of the details. 
I'm not going to give a one star review and not tell the real story. 

Beware...if you're paying $145/hr make sure every last own of them are working. I'm too nice...thinking the whole time Dre would make this right but not everybody is like me. So there's that."|Louisville|2019|False|0

So my question is, do y'all consider yourselves a part of the south? Is Missouri southern too?? 
I don't really know much about Arkansas, so I was a bit surprised to hear the accents with a drawl in the movie. Now, growing up, I was left under the assumption that the southern states (cultural-wise) were: Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, (northern) Florida, South Carolina, and some parts of Texas. Now I'm all confused as to what states actually share southern culture and what states don't. Where is the line drawn? I know that the Civil War isn't a good guide for it, as Arizona was a Confederate territory but isn't a southern state. If any of y'all have a list of states that are considered southern by their culture, that would help me so much. Thanks!

"So I work for a public school and this stupid voucher plan is making my coworkers and myself mad. We got to talking about how unfair it was to give private schools any state money, considering they are allowed to refuse to enroll Special Ed kids and don't have to deal with 504s and IEPs. Well one of my coworkers brought up the point that by taking state money, they are now subject to state and Federal civil rights law. 

If they refused to enroll someone who had a disability, or wasn't the right religion, that would amount to state sponsored discrimination. In my mind, this situation would fall under Burton v Wilmington Parking authority, where the SCOTUS ruled that a coffee shop and a state parking garage had a close symbiosis making the state government a joint participant in discrimination.

"Synopsis:

The new case average dropped considerably again today and has passed below 1000 for the first time since Oct 10th. This seems largely spurred by a significant drop in new tests. 30-day lows were set across the board again: 7-day New Case Average, 7-day Average Positivity, and Active Cases.

https://preview.redd.it/hu4fobns0be61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26464180f9b643d41ed337a820aea01914154aa

After a glitch last week, the percentage of new tests is pretty standard for a Friday (20.7% today vs 17.6% last week and \~20% the two weeks before), and the positivity continued to decline (5.8% today vs 6.3% last week.)

https://preview.redd.it/sn7yghyt0be61.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e88980fad1057f869b679af97e11ca53efade5

New tests decreased a whopping 21.7% since last Friday, but still outperformed new cases (down 28.6% in that same timeframe.) As a result, the 7-Day Positivity Average dropped down to another new 30-day low (down 0.07% since yesterday and down 0.59% since last Friday) to 6.3%. The 7-Day average for new cases is now down only 13.5% from where it was a week ago but the 7-Day average for testing is only down 5.3% in that same time. 

https://preview.redd.it/00ebe47v0be61.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb0a037ebbd957b4647f8716bc9bd3e7eed7f2c

Due to the number of new cases dropping considerably relative to last week, the 7-day average new case rate dropped 55 to \~970/day. The 7-day new tests average also dropped by almost 700 and is now \~16600/day.

After the lull last week in the downward trend, it seems to have to have resumed with strength and is now dropping considerably faster than I would have expected. It’s unfortunate to see that there are considerably less tests being performed, but that could just be a result of less people seeking testing since there are now less people getting sick. As I mentioned in a comment yesterday, I see no sign of there being difficulties in getting a test if you want one. The positivity rate also continues to drop, and this implies that we are not having issues with too little testing."|Iowa|2020|True|0

"My actual confession is at the end, but I think I should put it into context. So, let me give you some background:

I'm a 22-year old Mexican guy, living in Mexico, although I am *somewhat* well-traveled and I generally know what's up with the world.

I love to learn how things work, to reason, and to ponder. I'm very skeptical and I don't usually let emotions get on my way when assessing the truth of things. To illustrate this, I am the only atheist in my family even though I'd like my former religion (Mormonism, the religion I was raised in) to be true.

Now, let's leave that aside for a second and let me tell you a story: 

I had some issues with Mexican bureaucracy that prevented me from getting accepted into any High School in the country, so my best chance to study was to go to the U.S., where I had some relatives. In retrospect, it was a brave decision, as I spoke no English at the time.

I arrived in Utah and spent my High School years there. Long story short, I thrived academically in a way that I had never thought possible. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that all I had needed all along was a little (and I mean very little) guidance that neither my parents nor Mexican schools had been able to provide. Soon, I was a fully independent learner, diving into science, literature and Mathematics all by myself. Pretty cool!

As you can guess, my High School years were a time of deep introspection.

My inquisitive mind inevitably ended up thinking about the concept of human race. I always suspected (slightly) that the differences between human races were not skin-deep, but I wasn't sure.
Sure enough, I did my own research, read a lot of scientific studies, observed people of different races and ethnicities, and suddenly the conclusion that races aren't truly equal seemed inescapable, even though I wanted them to be.

Next, I wanted to know how that knowledge applied to myself. ""what is my racial makeup?"" I asked myself.
I thought about my family members, which look, in general, mostly (and please notice the word ""mostly"") European, while only one or two look fully European.
Still, I am from a country of Mestizos, so it wouldn't be surprising if I had some indigenous blood.

Since I hadn't taken a DNA ancestry test, I didn't have a lot of trustworthy information about it, but, hey!, fun fact: the Mormon church encourages its members to do genealogy, and it has the largest genealogy library in the world, so I didn't need to start from scratch, because my mom had done a lot of genealogy. I looked at my ancestry records and found all my ancestors supposedly traced all the way back to Europe, mostly Southern. BUT I later found out that some important records were altered, so there's a lot of missing information, and some of my relatives have subtle, suspiciously exotic facial features, so I couldn't delude myself: there was a chance that I wasn't completely white, especially when comparing myself to white Utahns. I compared myself to them and I felt pathetic.

Oh, yeah, white Utahns...Let me talk a little bit more about them.

I admire white Utahns. They are some of the most intelligent people I've ever met. They are some of the most valuable manpower in the world. Their home state is very safe and ranks sky-high on human development. Also, they have created a very important tech hub in the area, from scratch, with only two and a half million people. TWO AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE! Can you imagine that?
Not only that, but they look tall, blond, healthy, and plain majestic to me. I'm certainly not exaggerating when I say that I had a MASSIVE crush on every other girl I met there.

I should probably mention that they actually accepted me in their group. This is very significant, because Utah is a place where racism is very much alive. They usually wouldn't give Mexicans the time of the day. They would be superficially nice to them then speak ill behind their backs...but they wouldn't do that to me. I was different and they made it very clear with their attitudes, and those pretty, blonde girls would actually give a damn about me!

When I am socializing with white people, I feel an instant chemistry, a bond, a kinship. I rarely feel like an outsider. The interaction just feels very natural, and it is a feeling I rarely get when interacting with people of other races. It's really strange, since I'm technically not part of them. The only other comparable race in this regard are North-East Asians, kind of; and I don't really think it's a cultural thing. My perception is that some patterns of behavior are linked to biology and they become evident if you dig deep enough, regardless of culture. To me, it's like comparing a Pitbull with a Poodle: they can be trained similarly but you can't suppress their biology.

Anyway, Utah turned me into a different person, for the better, in every single aspect of my life. Wow!

The above wasn't really clear to me until I moved back to Mexico, got my life in order, and enrolled in an Engineering program at a Mexican university. After all, how bad could it be? When I embarked on my intellectual journey about race-related topics, I surely must have been overestimating the differences. Mexicans couldn't be that bad, since all of my best childhood memories took place in Mexico. Right?

Turns out my trust was misplaced. Studying at a Mexican university was one of the most disappointing and eye-opening experiences I've ever had. The education is a joke, the laboratory equipment rarely works even though there is a LOT of money to fix it (yeah, they blatantly steal the money), teachers are extremely condescending to students, leaders artificially inflate student statistics to make the university look good, and students only care about money and have no qualms about cheating their way through life.
Also, I got to have the experience of feeling like an alien...again. I mean, Mexicans have been warm to me as they are to everybody, and obviously I'm very familiar with Mexican culture, but I still felt like an alien.

It became even clearer when I spent a year abroad in Europe (did I mention that I got my life in order after living in Utah, making it possible to achieve anything I set my mind to, including going on an exchange?).
I got a glimpse of many cool Engineering projects that are being developed there. Once again, I felt like I was truly in contact with my creative side. Once again I felt like people was sane.

I'm back in Mexico again, working on a project to help the country, as agreed when I was awarded the scholarship to study abroad, but I simply can't picture myself living here over the long term. I will get a job abroad and get out of here as soon as I can.
It makes me sad that I have to do this. Mexico is an insanely wealthy country; a true goldmine, and I now understand that the real problem are the people who inhabit it.

Now, my actual confession:

I really, REALLY love white girls, especially Caucasian, blonde girls from Northern European stock. Seriously. The sole thought of being in a relationship with one of them (given that we are actually compatible, of course) makes me very happy; and, much to my surprise, I stand a very good chance.

I don't think I'm being superficial. I already told you what I think. If you think I'm being superficial, I suggest you read my thoughts again.
I have met many such girls of different cultures (Netherlands, Germany, Norway...both urban and rural) and I stand by my words.

Soon I'm going to take a DNA ancestry test via 23andme, and I'm terrified of the possibility of not being white enough. I don't want to know the results.
Now, don't get me wrong. My relatives are all very smart people. They are above-average entrepreneurs, Engineers, doctors, etc., so I have good genes, but if I turned out to have a sizable percentage of non-white in me, I would hate myself for polluting such a fine gene pool, which is already threatened.

That's my secret, and this is probably the only thing where my emotions trump my reasoning, because I want it bad enough. 

So, what are your (insightful, preferably) thoughts on this? I really want your honest thoughts. If you'd rather not post your opinion under your real account, I guess you could create a throwaway one.

"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao.

How is it being non-white in AK? I (white guy) grew up in the Deep South and have experienced out in the open for racism down there many times through my childhood (towards friends, family, etc). That kind of racism is easy to see and is known. Having lived in a small foothills community in CO for over a decade know I have noticed more subtle forms of racism…people being threatened by people of color wanting to meet up for hiking groups (community members claiming reverse racism for simply wanting to connect with people of color in an overwhelmingly white community). I’m hoping to gather from Alaskans what life is like for people of color in larger communities (Fairbanks specifically) and smaller as well. from the outside looking in it seems like community is such and important part of life in AK and the reality  of living in such an extreme place may get people past looking at skin color as such a dividing aspect of life. My SO is a Mexican/Spanish woman and just would like to get a pulse on how that might affect her from a cultural perspective of the state if we were to relocate their eventually. I grew up lucky enough to get to travel around Alaska fishing and hunting with my father and your state has always had my heart.

"Hi all, looking to take a big Alaska vacation in May!  My fiancé and I are heading up from May 11-18 to celebrate our birthdays.  We were planning on flying into Anchorage, renting a car for the week, driving north to Trapper Creek area for three nights to explore the Denali region and do some hiking.  After that we plan to head to Kenai peninsula for four nights and this is where we are seeking advice.  We were advised by a friend that Seward and Homer are must sees.  Problem being, they are 3 hours drive apart which would be a little too far to stay in one and take a day trip to the other.  

Would you recommend one of Seward or Homer over the other?  Should we look to stay in the middle somewhere (Soldotna, Kenai, Sterling) and take day drives to both spots?  Am I thinking too much like a lower 48er- is it possible to catch a flight between the two towns for a day trip?

We love hiking and fishing, looking to see some wild life (fiancé has yet to see a wild moose, its on her bucket list), maybe a sight seeing flight, would love to catch a charter boat out of Homer for some halibut.  Would also love to catch a boat tour of the Kenai glaciers / Fjords.  Thank you all in advance!"|Alaska|2024|False|0

"I am currently residing in a state with uncertain economical outcomes. Without getting into details, the state's overall policies, investments, and changes in their economy do not seem promising in the long term for further investing. It's a sunk cost.

I'm considering alternatives and Carolinas are one option as I'm drawn to southern climates as well. However after researching, I'm not seeing a lot on growth data or potential future industries. I figured it's skewed to my lack of knowledge (local knowledge problem) and so I would appreciate the honest opinion form those who reside in this area. What are your opinions on the prospects and future growth for SC? 

I'm really torn on NC or SC but want SC due to the climent but only if I can plant seeds worth investing long term. INdustry specifics? What's the trend or emerging industries? Also which cities should I look into for more growth opportunities?

I did a survey over facebook last year and through another account ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/7c1v7j/casual_english_vowel_sounds_native_english/)) and got several hundred people to take it, but only 4 were from South Carolina.

Thanks,

"We've been renting this place for 2 years now, renewing yearly. The lease will end around New Year's, but the property manager started asking in September (about 4 months in advance to the lease end!) whether we plan to renew. 

Yes we do, but she kept asking for how long and at what price. [Realestate.com.au](http://Realestate.com.au) and similar sites only show availability 6 weeks in advance; that will be mid-November. So we're over 2 months too early to get an idea of the market. I said so, but she keeps pushing. I proposed a 6 month renewal for the current price, she wants a higher price for 12 months. It starts to look on the higher side of current prices, but OK I guess to avoid the cost of moving. 

So I'm wanting to tell her that we're OK in principle with that offer, but we won't sign anything until mid-November when we can actually start to check the market, and to please piss off until then. 

**My question is:** how come they get so pushy *so early*? Can they do anything to force us to decide so early? I *imagine* they could get petty and somehow decide they don't want to renew us, but I *hope* that, just like the process of moving would be costly and uncomfortable for us, it would also be some friction for them, right? 

Even, is there anywhere I could complain about this pressure?

For context, this PM has always been starting the renewal process early and I always have had to push back a bit; last year it was 3 months early. But this is getting silly. 4 months!"|brisbane|2024|False|0

"My partner and I eat out a lot. Moo moo, Walters, Fatcow, Boatshed etc. 2 or 3 times a week. The Norman when we have the kids.

We’ve dined at black hide 20 or 30 times, and with the treasury gold membership we enjoyed the 30% off.

The new black hide is such a let down. The wine list sucks. Only a few Barossa Shiraz, in fact like 5 Shiraz only on the list.  Nothing aged, no middle range. One torbrek but out of stock. Anything over $1k is a grange or HOG.

Sides, ok but fat cow is complementary.

"Has anyone dealt with renovating an old building in Montana?

We bought a building built in 1909 that has been used consistently but not kept up very well. It hasn't looked good for probably 60 years. Our goal is not to create luxury apartments or anything, just make the space useful and affordable. 

When applying for a federal grant to help cover some of the costs, we had to report to SHPO. Unless we follow their stipulations, we aren't eligible for the federal grant funding. Unfortunately, the cost of period-appropriate windows and fixtures would make the original grant funding moot. If we chose to stick with the funding and be subject to their regulations, we'd need to raise rent cost, which goes against our values. Housing is tough here and our hope is to make it easier to live here, not more difficult. We are probably going to withdraw from the grant entirely, but now we're on their radar and they are pushing to put our building on the historic registry.

How much involvement can we expect from them? This is not a famous building and has looked abandoned (even though it wasn't) for a very long time. Is this going to slow down an already arduous task? Thanks for any input.

If it matters, we are not out-of-state investors or anything. We were born and raised in this small town and are working on this building as a way to invest in our community."|Montana|2023|False|0

" This is part of an email Mike Rounds sent to me today. What he is trying to do is convince you that while he has some control over 'discretionary spending' he has no say in the funding of Social Security and Medicare; he 's trying to fool you into giving him just that, the ability to cut both these programs. You gotta' read between the lines of the fine print!

""Background brief for the next question: The federal government spent $4.8 trillion on mandatory spending programs in Fiscal Year 2021. This includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and paying the interest on our debt. Furthermore, the federal government spent $1.6 trillion on what is termed discretionary spending, which includes defense spending and the rest of the operations of government. While Congress votes on the defense and non-defense discretionary portions of the budget, the spending on the mandatory programs is not actively managed by Congress and does not get voted on through our annual appropriations process.

""Were you aware that over 70% of annual U.S. federal spending is considered ""mandatory spending"" that Congress does not vote on?""

"Yesterday evening I got a phone call offering me a great deal on DirecTV. Several factors made me suspicious.

(1) I never get ""legitimate"" telemarketing calls on my cell phone, not counting companies I already do business with. (2) The caller had a strong accent which I think I'd call Middle Eastern. Such accents can come from legitimate calls, so that was a minor factor, just mentioning it for completeness. (3) The caller ID showed my local exchange (Kingston). That's the big one, since DirecTV doesn't have offices in Kingston, and scammers love to spoof local exchanges. Hardly anyone in Kingston has a Middle Eastern accent.

I decided a couple of sentences in that this had to be a scam call and blew off the caller. A Web search shows that scam calls impersonating DirecTV are common. Just one more thing to be cautious of when answering the phone."|NewHampshire|2019|False|0

"I rented a kayak on Eagle Creek last fall, definitely looking to go again. Only had one complaint. The trash. The reservoir is full of floating litter. I happened to have a plastic bag on me with snacks and sunscreen that I emptied into my backpack and used it to collect trash. Gave me an idea maybe eagle Creek could use. What if they issued a small trash bag along with the kayak and if you came back with it reasonably full of trash you got $5 off your rental. Wouldn't cost them much in $, the lake would get a ""free"" cleaning from visitors making it nicer for the environment and guests. Just a thought.

"Hey fellow Hoosiers, I'm wanting to see about getting some choir singers together for a video. I wanted to put together a video for a song. Would definitely like to get some people who have some musical backgrounds and play instruments, can shoot a video, etc. Shoot me a comment and/or a pm if you are interested. 

The basic outline of my idea is forming a fun group of people who love music and would like to collaborate in making a song, or songs, that really highlight genres of music across the board and use it as a platform to really display everyone's individualistic talents accompanied by others to help better convey each person's story through their song. 

My first thought is doing something that has a lot of reverb, something good like a church, but maybe like an abandoned building or something. A choir but seeing how we can play with it and incorporate other types of music in it to make something beautiful. 

It's just a thing to do, not a paid promotion or anything, but if you love music, are bored, and want to try something new in your life, now's the time to do it. I'd also love for anyone who'd be willing to assist me in working all this out. If you are a pro at scheduling and organizing things, hit me up. 

Lastly, all credit would be given to the group in the videos, and I'd plan to upload it on the web of course as well.

"Okay. My wife and I were near the Meijer on Carmel Drive and we saw this... thing. It kind of looked like [this](https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photo-velomobile-bicycle-car-recumbent-bike-modern-streamlined-vehicle-uses-human-power-to-travel-image40753605), but the wheels were totally covered and the top was closed in like the rest of it - we had to drive past it twice to confirm through the tiny windows that someone was in it, since we initially thought it was, like, a self-driving car or something. 

I would normally assume it's just a recumbent bike with a body kit or something. But this thing was going decently fast at a sustained rate - like 35mph(?) maybe. I passed it pretty easily in my car both times but it wasn't being disruptively slow, like a bike would be. 

Any idea? Again, this was over right by the Meijer on Carmel drive - the guy in it was heading towards the roundabout at Pennsylvania. This will drive me crazy until I get an answer, and I hope to god one of you know what I'm talking about.

was wondering if anyone would know any good 2-3 day hikes. I'd prefer 2 days since my friends have a bit of time restrictions this holiday but open to hear anything you guys might be able to suggest!

I was originally going to take them on the southern-eastern wilsons prom hike that's shy of 40km in about 2.5-3 days which i've done before quite comfortably. Knowing this anything around that difficulty might be good as one has never been hiking/camping before and isn't too fit. 

Also would be great if they're scenic for some nice photos :)

"This is probably not the right place to post this, but I am not sure where to start. In 1979, I was born in South West Harbor, Maine. My family lived in what was known as the Dicky Butler House. Apparently, this house had the negative, evil, bad reputation. Kids would always cross the street and run away from the house. My mom and dad asked around town as to the history behind the house, but people basically refused to discuss the topic. Even for years later, after we moved to Portland when we would run into people from SWH we would mention the Dick Butler House and we would be met with some weird faces, and they would avoid discussing the topic.

"I'm relocating to Maine, and I'm wondering what [M.B.A.R. 11A(a)(2)](https://mainebarexaminers.org/reciprocal-admission/qualifications/) means by the phrase, ""**active practice of law**,"" in the following excerpt:

In order to be qualified for admission by motion pursuant to Maine Bar Admission Rule 11A, an applicant must meet the following criteria:
Has been primarily engaged in the **active practice of law** in one or more United States jurisdictions (which may include the active practice of law in the State of Maine to the extent permitted by Rule 5.5(d) of the Maine Rules of Professional Conduct) for at least three (3) of the five (5) years immediately preceding the date upon which the motion is filed.

To clarify, I began working under a practice order in my current jurisdiction about a year before I was admitted to the bar. I basically was allowed to perform all the functions of an attorney, as long as I was supervised while in court.

Do the Maine Bar Examiners consider ""active practice of law"" to simply mean ""admitted to practice in a jurisdiction,"" or do they take other factors into account as well?"|Maine|2017|False|0

 Not sure how these restaurants call what they serve soul food. In the 30 years since I move here with my family. I've had people over the years recommend different place around Georgia, where they had lunch or dinner. I've visit a few over the years, only to be disappointed. Which bring me too my lates search for soul food this particular restaurant has been in business for over 20 years. My order Salmon never had a piece of dry salmon 1 inch high. AND I didn't know they serve it over rice. The rice was soggy, collard greens, not my mother greens and sweet potato souffle which had too much cinnamon. I've cooked everyday over the year raising the kid's, family holidays. so i know my way around the kitchen. my husband and i yes, we are part of the baby boomer. he tries to get me to stop cooking and join the let's go out and eat crowd.

So I am active duty military, I recently was in a situation where I needed to drive my back up vehicle which did not have an up to date registration or up to date insurance. long story short I was pulled over and given a ticket for both of those and let go with a court date of January 10th. I have a Washington state license which I have had for my entire 15 years of military service with no issue. Yesterday I was pulled over for speeding in a separate vehicle that was fully legal to drive. The Officer however was not understanding that I did not need a Georgia license in order drive in Georgia as active duty military so she proceeded to arrest me and take me into jail which I just bailed myself out of. Was this a legit arrest or should I be hiring a lawyer for false arrest. The only thing I am concerned about is the temporary license number that is given to you if you receive a ticket in Georgia which I have looked up multiple times and have no way of seeing any information online. my current Washington license is not suspended or revoked I have checked this multiple times including from a police officer to verify. I am wondering if this default license number that was given to me is somehow suspended or revoked or something without me knowing or having a way to figure out online. |Georgia|2023|False|0

Personally I’ve been to Ace Hotel twice, which is open to non-guests, $20 entry but the money goes towards  food/drink and it’s really nice and clean so definitely a good spot to float some beers.

I’ve also been to the drifter hotel a few times for various DJ events. Definitely a mixed bag- usually a cover, overcrowded on weekends, pool water gets pretty filthy I’ve only dared it once, but the toptional views and regular house music DJs are attractive poolside vibes. 

Would love to hear y’alls tips for getting wet this summer. I know some of the hotel pools like W and Meridian don’t open to public until Labor Day.  I also don’t have any ethical qualms with crashing the private/hotel pools. Here’s an article from curbed, if y’all have any input or experience I’d love to hear it.

"Hoping there are some opinions here, or someone who has experienced similar.

Just finished up at a rental place, during the rental period one copy of a front door key got bent (which I then threw out). 

The rental agency are saying since I can't return the exact same keys as I was provided, the lock has to be replaced and charged to me.

I feel like I should be charged to replace the key, but not the lock. The argument that since I can't prove the key was broken and disposed of is irrelevant - any renter could theoretically makes 100s of copies of the house keys and hold onto them. Either they have to replace all the locks after any renter leaves, or it's just assumed the renter hasn't done this.

Is there any concrete answer on this - am I required to pay for a new lock and locksmith because I can only provide 1 of the two original front door keys?"|canberra|2022|False|0

"I am hoping someone here can give me some advice. I am nearing the end of the recruitment process for a couple of APS positions, both requiring security clearance, NV1 or NV2.

I am concerned about criminal associates. My sister’s boyfriend has just gotten out of jail on bail. His case is fairly serious and I have suspicions he is connected to organized crime, mostly because my sister has sort of been on the periphery of that for years and I am sure she is a “known associate”. She has also worked in the sex industry, not as a sex worker, but as a manager for many years. She’s had substance abuse problems and had a couple of DUI’s, but nothing else. She’s been to rehab and has been clean for a while and has just gotten out of the industry she’s been in.

She and I are very, very different. I went to law school, honours and academic excellence scholarships, and have always been on the straight and narrow. I tried weed and ecstasy as a teen, but nothing since. I barely even drink. I don’t associate with “criminals”, except through working in criminal law.

My sister and I aren’t especially close. We don’t share intimate details of our lives with each other. I lived very far from her for the last 8 years and consequently only saw her a couple of times. Now I live closer and see her about once a month. 

She wants me to meet her boyfriend. I am not sure whether to meet him while I am going through this process.

"Hi friends,

I'm considering attending NJIT/Rutgers/S.I.T (among others spread throughout NY-NJ metro area) for the rest of my undergrad and any feedback would be extremely appreciated!

Desired degree is bio/bio-tech/bio-informatics/biomed engineering (anything works, since I need pre-reqs for med school and love these fields anyway). So far I have completed mainly gen ed courses. I am a great cook/baker (so meal plans are w/e for me), value my independence, tire easily (not psyched for commutes but I can deal) and want to finish up my degree as quickly + with as little debt as possible. (Yes, I know I have to appreciate the experience etc etc--these goals are not mutually exclusive)

I would really appreciate any feedback from any student/alumni of the unis mentioned above--or any other unis tbh--as I am trying to make the most informed decision I can possibly make!

Questions:

* How are the science/math courses (bio, chem, orgo, physics)? Too difficult, just right, professors, workload? Anything is of use to me.

* Did you participate in any clubs/organizations, and if so, how was that? Is there a social union?

* if you commuted--how was it?! Exhausting? Draining? Soul-sucking? Surprisingly not bad?

* Do/did you live on-campus, or off-campus and how is it?! Rent rates, roommates, food, utilities, weekend scene, jobs?

* How much did you manage to fund thru financial aid/merit scholarships/private scholarships & grants? (lots of debt or no worries?)

* If you studied abroad for a semester, did your uni give you a hard time or was it gr8 for you?

* Are you satisfied with your experience & education? Did you get where you wanted to afterwards?

Please friends--any feedback you can give (esp from those of you who are math/science-based degree-seekers) would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance!!"|NewJersey|2016|False|0

"My partner and i recently got engaged, and while its a really exciting time in our lives we have realized that weddings can be pretty pricey (who would have guessed) and there a lot of options out there.

The minute you search ""wedding"" in google you're in for a world of pain.

We aren't really keen on the traditional wedding structure and wanted a really laid back, cocktail styled day.

We have done a bit of searching ourselves but if anyone has any locations that may fit what we are after, id greatly appreciate the help!

We are after a rustic / shabby chic wedding. (not a literal barn, but exposed brick, fairy lights that kind of stuff).

We are specifically trying to find a cafe/restaurant  that has a big tree where we can have the ceremony, take some photos and have a lovely cocktail evening with our guests (under 70)

We have searched around the Mornington Peninsula area specifically, as its so beautiful but anywhere that fits the bill is worth a look!

"Have you heard this robocall (soundboard) ""Hello this is Ray. Thanks for calling back. How are you today? Ar..are you there? I called on behalf of the Texas Coalition of Police & Sheriffs just kicked off their fund raiser that helps to provide financial assistance...""

From what I can find, the calls are coming from Outreach Calling (super legit website) owned by Damian Muziani ([here](https://twitter.com/DamianEmCee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [here](http://damianmuziani.com/Home_Page.php), [here](http://damianmuziani.brandyourself.com/), [here](https://www.facebook.com/muziani), and [here](http://973espn.com/author/damianmuziani/), etc.). The address on their website is listed as the company Regus which offers shared office space (a front for businesses). Glassdoor reviews says how shitty this company is. Tampa Bay Times did a whole write up [here](http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities2.page) on 'America's Worst Charities'. Smarter Giving has terrible reviews ([here](http://smarter-giving.info/category/outreach-calling/)). KSAT did a write up ([here](http://www.ksat.com/news/defenders/dont-be-fooled-know-before-you-give)) that's identical. Essentially, his company thrives on donations for charities in which they only give back like 1% of what they make and pocket the rest. Essentially he pays $8/hr and treats employees like shit.

Apparently he is in New Jersey, a struggling actor, and a *update* anchor for 97.3 ESPN WENJ. 

My question, is how can a radio station hire this guy. They have to know. How has the station, his Facebook, his Linkdin, his Twitter, his website, etc. not been BLASTED with people calling in/posting ""Hello this is Ray""?

"Hello, hoping for some advice related to traveling through your state, as we'll be visiting this summer. Planning to fly to Glacier National Park in Montana to explore, then travel to Devil's Lake and Grand Forks, ND to visit family. 

We are really interested in taking Amtrak if we can - the Empire Builder line runs through this corridor and is competitive with driving! Plus we really like trains. However, we see some logistical issues related to train arrival times, and getting from train station to hotel or rental car. We'd probably be getting off the train in either Minot, Devil's Lake, or Grand Forks. 

So my main questions: If we needed a ride (traditional cab, or rideshares Uber or Lyft) from a train station to a hotel, is it likely we'd be able to get a ride in the 10pm-1am time frame? How is cell service - can we count on it? Basically wondering if we should be worried about being stranded somewhere, or if it's no big deal and we're worrying for nothing. 

Thanks for any advice or tips!"|NorthDakota|2021|False|0

"We were just offered a spot for our soon to be 1 year old. We don’t know anybody at GLPCC but the tour went well. It’s established, the teachers were on the younger side but seemed to handle the conflicts we saw during our tour well. It’s walking distance for us which is my main motivation, our current daycare is in shoreline and the drive is tough with work schedules. We spent about 80-90 minutes a day driving our kid there and back. Our current daycare is a mixed age home daycare so there’s a bit of a sense of community that my partner feels may be lacking at other daycares, even though the class size will be the same, our kid will be one of 12 1-2 year olds instead of the youngest in a 0-5 daycare where she probably gets more attention being the baby. 

Who can provide any testimony in favor or against of the experience at GLPCC? "|seattle|2024|False|0

"Advice on moving to Seattle: recommendations

My partner (32) and I (44) will move at the start of July, coming from Tokyo. The short of our lifestyle, gay but not deep in the scene, interracial (Asian or Japanese supermarket would be awesome), dog that walks 4 miles a day, drive, eat out a fair bit but maybe will cook more. I work remotely but travel a bit, he has full working visa and would like to find a job but not sure on timing.

We will stay near pike place market for the first month and look for long term apartment. I’m earning a bit over 270k, maybe in future he will pitch some in but not relying on it. We are used to living around 800sqf in Tokyo but in smaller rooms. He loves high rises, I like them for the facilities but prefer living lower to the ground.

So the basic question, where would you live and why?

The other fantastic wildcard is zero credit history. Will need to rely on company guarantee, or some third party guarantee. Japan has no convertible credit rating system to US."|seattle|2024|False|0

"I'm making this post to highlight a frequent problem I see in /r/Seattle that I honestly believe is making open discussion much harder than it needs to be, and to solicit opinions on what we can do to fix it. 

I see this pattern play out continuously: 

1. Some user makes a post complaining about a politically contentious topic (eg: homelessness, drug use, etc). 
2. A small group of Reddit super-users (eg: 300k+ comment karma) will immediately descend into the comments section to attack and shame the poster and any agreeing commentors for not being sufficiently liberal or progressive.
3. The comments section devolves into arguments and personal attacks. 
    1. If the super-users are upvoted, they leave their comments up. 
    2. If the super-users are downvoted, they delete all of their comments and block anyone who responded to them.

A good example of this is [this recent post about public transit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1d45gef/as_a_transit_lover_im_worried/) - these folks immediately jumped in to shit on OP for their opinion being reactionary / regressive / republican (literally), became incredibly condescending and rude when they got downvoted, then cut their losses and deleted all comments. 

The beautiful thing about the /r/Seattle comments section is the ability to hear opinions from a wide and diverse array of viewpoints. I know what my friends think, I know what my coworkers think, I want to hear what people *outside of my circle* think. However, I feel that this is absolutely ruined by this group of people who seem more motivated by dunking on others to score karma than actually engaging with the debate in any remotely productive way. Just look at how defensive OP had to be in their public transit post - they couldn't just express their personal and subjective feeling of being uncomfortable, they had to be on guard. It's almost like they knew the attacks were coming.

I know this is the internet, but it's gotten to the point where I actually know these folks by username - if I see them in the comments, 9 times out of 10 it's just the same thing again and again. Why do we tolerate this toxic behavior? Is there anything we can do about it?"|seattle|2024|False|0

"Just wanted to thank whoever is responsible for this. My commute takes me along the bike lane that runs through the waterfront and down the bike lanes on E Marginal Way S to SODO. 

When I heard about the new fancy bike lane being built down there, it was a bit bittersweet. Yes, obviously I love new bike infrastructure, but it wasnt going to be completed until 2025 at least and I would have to find a different, potentially much less flat and protected, bike route to work.

However, to my surprise, SDOT appears to be doing everything possible to keep bike traffic running smoothly during construction. Not only have they rerouted truck traffic though temporary lanes, but they've even made temporary bike lanes squeezed on the sides. They even have flaggers that watch for bike traffic and wave them through when they dont have enough room for a bike lane and a transit lane.

They could have easily closed off the bike lanes entirely during construction to allow car and truck traffic to still go in both directions along the street, but because of this extra care, us bike commuters can bike to work in safety AND we will get a new, even better bike lane in the process. I guess you really can have your cake and eat it too! Usually this kind of thought only goes into how things will impact car traffic, so it feels really nice to be thought of as a biker.

That's really all I wanted to say. Thank you SDOT! (or whoever made this decision!)"|seattle|2024|False|0
"Every single day I have to drive down Eagle Road.   


I. HATE. IT.  


WHY DOES EVERYONE GO 30MPH DOWN EAGLE ROAD? Seriously people. It is 40mph from State Street to the Boise River, and then it is 55 miles per hour from the river until Fairview. From fairview until Overland it is 50mph and from overland to the end of South Eagle Road it is 40mph. So there is no need to go 30mph.  


No one can ever go the damn speed limit. It TRULY grinds my damn gears. When it was announced that the law passed that requires slow drivers to go to the right lane, I had high hopes that it would alleviate this problem; only it has not. It doesn't seem like they are enforcing it, because we still have people going 30 mph down Eagle Road.

"My fiancé and I heard about the free covid testing at the Pepsi center and he decided to go take one even though neither of us had any symptoms. We were shocked when his results came back positive! I went and took one (the whole process takes about 3 minutes) and I am positive as well! Turns out we are both asymptomatic carriers.

Representatives from the center called us and let us know to call back if symptoms develop. They said they want everyone to go get tested. When you sign up online, it gives you a list of symptoms. You need to check at least one to get a test. Do it. They want people to come in. If they are able to show the rates are low, we can move forward with reopening the city, and if they’re high, they can roll out more resources. I’ve heard some people expressing that you shouldn’t go unless you need to because of concern that we will run out of tests. According to the people I spoke with, this is not a concern at all.

Edit: I’ve been told that as of 6/1/2020, you now can be tested without having any symptoms! Answer honestly and go get tested!"|Denver|2020|False|0

"Native of Virginia Beach here. I’ve lived in a couple of different places (NYC, LA, now living in NoVA) and often find myself arguing that Hampton Roads is much more aligned with the Northeast region of the U.S. (NYC, Boston, Wilmington, Baltimore, D.C., etc.) than with the Southeast. I feel that culturally and economically (given that it’s sometimes seen as the southern tip of the Northeast Megalopolis) it’s much more Northern than Southern.

Also share your opinion on other parts of Virginia (or even Virginia as a whole) that you think should be classified as the North instead of the South, if any!

Edit: Meant to say northeast, not northwest

Edit 2: I’ve since sort of landed on more of Mid-Atlantic. I like this distinction, as I find it much more accurate than Northeast and Southeast. It’s just that a lot of people don’t classify the Mid-Atlantic as a real region."|Virginia|2022|False|0

"So I’m a long ways out from making it happen, but I’m considering moving to Hawaii. Within the next two years I will have plenty of savings to get settled into something nice.

I want to do a long term stay before I decide anything, but I want to know what areas I should look at to narrow down where I should visit.

I’m a nurse. I’m also an avid outdoorsman (lots of hiking, bow hunting, fishing under my belt). I have a lot of experience with gardening and livestock. I live near Houston, Texas currently.

I’m hoping to live in an area that is: 

Within 1 hour of beaches I can swim in (preferably closer)
Within 1 hour from a “good” fishing location
A good place for growing fruit trees.

I’m also wanting more of an “off grid” home life.

I know Puna seems to be popular with mainlanders, but the lack of swimming (I hear the beaches have rough water and that most of the water there is very... gross) and high crime rate scares me. My current home is fairly secluded so I’ve never had to worry about that.

"We’re about to renew our utility plan and noticed that average kWh rates are significantly higher than our last contract that was signed 24 months ago.

The avg rate on that plan was 7.8 cents/kWh for 24 month plan. The best rate I can find now is 9.8cents/kWh for a similar plan. That’s a 25% increase.

Are utility rates unusually high right now, or was my last contract unusually low?

"Recently, Marshall County Animal Control has enacted a 60 day to euthanasia policy. The community has done a fantastic job getting these dogs out. Over 100 animals have either been adopted, fostered, or pulled by rescue organizations in the last two weeks. But, there are three left that are scheduled to die on either Monday or 5/15. 

Al is a German Shepherd who did great with livestock and other dogs but was intolerant of a rowdy puppy with no manners yet. For that, he's scheduled to die as early as Monday. 

Mae is a tuxedo pitty type with dog aggression issues. Reported to be great with people.

Champ is a yellow lab mix who's goofy and needs some training, but would make somebody a wonderful pet.

We're heading from Launceston to Hobart on Wednesday. Just wanted to ask what's a fun place should check out? 

I wanted to go to any comic book stores down here but couldn't seem to find any online. Theres one I think in Moonah I want to check out on the way to Hobart. Anyone know of any stores still open?

We also need to get a phone mount for our rental car, we can't seem to find one and dont know anywhere that might sell them other than maybe like harvey norman but ugh.

"Hi friends,

I'm considering attending NJIT/Rutgers/S.I.T (among others spread throughout NY-NJ metro area) for the rest of my undergrad and any feedback would be extremely appreciated!

Desired degree is bio/bio-tech/bio-informatics/biomed engineering (anything works, since I need pre-reqs for med school and love these fields anyway). So far I have completed mainly gen ed courses. I am a great cook/baker (so meal plans are w/e for me), value my independence, tire easily (not psyched for commutes but I can deal) and want to finish up my degree as quickly + with as little debt as possible. (Yes, I know I have to appreciate the experience etc etc--these goals are not mutually exclusive)

I would really appreciate any feedback from any student/alumni of the unis mentioned above--or any other unis tbh--as I am trying to make the most informed decision I can possibly make!

Questions:

* How are the science/math courses (bio, chem, orgo, physics)? Too difficult, just right, professors, workload? Anything is of use to me.

* Did you participate in any clubs/organizations, and if so, how was that? Is there a social union?

* if you commuted--how was it?! Exhausting? Draining? Soul-sucking? Surprisingly not bad?

* Do/did you live on-campus, or off-campus and how is it?! Rent rates, roommates, food, utilities, weekend scene, jobs?

* How much did you manage to fund thru financial aid/merit scholarships/private scholarships & grants? (lots of debt or no worries?)

* If you studied abroad for a semester, did your uni give you a hard time or was it gr8 for you?

* Are you satisfied with your experience & education? Did you get where you wanted to afterwards?

Please friends--any feedback you can give (esp from those of you who are math/science-based degree-seekers) would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance!!"|NewJersey|2016|False|0

"July 27th, Saturday: my fiance, my 7yo stepdaughter and myself were out of town for a birthday trip. LMPD reported to my house for an aggressive dog call. 


My stepdaughter's grandmother (Juanelle) was staying at our house and dogsitting while we were away. At some point in the morning, our 3yo hound dog got out of our yard and into a neighbor's. Juanelle realized this and retrieved the dog from the yard and returned him to our home, not knowing that the neighbor had called the police. 


Later- she took both pups, the hound dog and a pit bull, outside to the bathroom. Not knowing that at that moment an LMPD officer was following up on the call and knocking at the front door.


Walter, our Coonhound mix, saw someone in front of his house and went to greet the officer, who then drew his weapon, firing multiple rounds- hitting and killing him. Mercy, our female Pitbull, was also shot in the leg and ran inside.

I received a frantic call from Juanelle telling me what had happened, and also spoke to a Sergeant Matthew McDaniel.

They left the body of our dog to rot in the sun in our front yard after promising that animal control would take care of ""disposal"" and didn't so much as do a wellness check on our other dog that was shot and cowering in our house. 


These were beloved members of our family and had done nothing wrong outside of being in a neighbor's yard for a matter of minutes. One of them is dead and the other has a shattered leg from a gunshot wound and will likely have to have it amputated. 


I believe that LMPD acted completely irresponsibly and dangerously and not only jeopardized the safety and lives of our pets, but did so in such a callous manner that we are shocked.



Any light you can shed on our story is greatly appreciated."|Louisville|2019|False|0

A business called [14th Street Storage](https://louisvillestorageunits.com) with a listed address of 1400 S 14th. Searching this business on Google Maps shows it between 13th and 15th, where 14th Street would be, however an actual 14th doesn't exist in map view, and street view opens to 15th. 

The other result is a Wikipedia entry for the [14th Street Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Street_Bridge_(Ohio_River)) which also exists between 13th and 15th, but again, is not on an actual 14th Street according to Maps.

* Notices have been placed on the car by myself and the strata management, and haven't been touched since.
* I've called towing companies - some are willing to take it on, noting that the car is down on a lower basement floor - but will charge me a significant cost, and will only leave it in a visitor space (my complex has no visitor spaces).
* I've checked with the police, the car is not stolen. The police apparently won't get involved as the car is on private property.
* Building management has checked camera footage and noted that it was parked on Friday night, but they could not identify the person as they were wearing a mask and hat.
* Building management is trying to get in contact with the owners of the adjacent car spaces.
* My property manager can only keep calling the strata company.

At the moment I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Given now it's day 6 since the car has been in my spot.

"So i am moving into a new house tomorrow and yesterday i got an email from Meloneys that the maintenance team needs to come inspect the balcony to give a quote to fix the balcony.

I cant help but feel frustrated about this since my current landlord did the same when she knew we were about to leave she came into the house with a team and strata manager in our absence stating that this was an emergency as there was a leak in the water pipes somewhere (it was actually to get quotes to get her house renovated)

Now we found ourselves a new place leaving behind this awful experience with our previous landlord, and just after we have paid them the rent and the bond and signed the lease they tell us oh also the balcony needs to be fixed so please accommodate the maintenance team.
To do this i have to either miss my job and stay at home or let complete strangers in my house in my absence.

Please tell me they can’t just use that clause again where they don’t need the tenants permission to enter the house if it is and urgent repairs like a safety hazard of a broken balcony.

"Hello, all! My husband and I are at the point where we can start seriously looking at homes. We have a 20% down payment for our price range, as well as a modest but not insignificant cash bonus ready to go.

We're focusing on areas that don't appeal to the Ski/Remote crowd. Also, far enough away from Burlington that national rental agencies swooping in to install cheap granite countertops, bottom rung stainless steel appliances, and flip it as an $1800/month ""luxury condo"" is less of a concern.  Between current listings and recent sales records of properties similar to what we're looking for, we know it's not impossible to find something relatively soon we can afford.

Anyone know of realtors who have had success for local people making initial offers at/around asking price for starter homes? We know that this may be a long, arduous process and are hoping to find someone who sticks it out with local couples, and understands that we can't afford to play games or get into bidding wars."|Vermont|2021|False|0

"Memorial Day weekend my girlfriend and I are visiting my sister in North Carolina.  Tuesday am we are headed out and want to be at my friend’s house in folly beach by Wednesday night.  I’m an outdoorsman but haven’t explored much down south.  I was intrigued by both Congaree NP and woods bay state park.    My original thought was to either leave super early Tuesday, drive 3 hours, and do a canoe trip at Congaree Tuesday and then camp overnight,  or hit up something like woods bay Tuesday on the way to Congaree, camp and kayak Wednesday.

I was assuming it would make more sense to rent kayaks than haul them down there in my truck, but I’m open to both, as we also plan on doing some kayaking once we are in folly.  I would just want a reasonably clear idea on where to kayak as I’ve heard kayaking down south can be a bit more maze like than up north.  I’d need a shuttle at the very least.

feel free to tell me that any of this is a bad idea, or to steer me in a different direction. maybe skip woods bay and zip straight to Congaree and maximize our time there.  or perhaps skip both and do something entirely different.  Or do a short stop at Congaree and save kayaking for after we arrive at folly beach?

Davidson opposes mail-in voting and only abides by it because it’s law. His arguments against it are extremely niche and what-ifffy. For example, he literally argues:

>It gives a greater opportunity for ballot harvesting and ballot stuffing. Now there's no proof that this is happening, but neither is there proof that it isn't happening.

That he would even consider this method of logic and publicly declare it tells me he‘s a believer of Trump’s lies—and even if he isn’t, he clearly participates in the same rhetorically fallacious nonsense. 

His arguments against ranked-choice voting are cherry picked examples of RCV results he seems to think didn’t work (because they worked just fine but republicans didn’t win).

He wants to shorten the window people have to vote, citing potential ‘voter’s regret’ by people who vote early but want to change their mind.

He conceded that the one redeeming quality is that people have time to vet the candidates carefully in front of their ballots instead of in lines—which is the most important feature of it, and against which any of the other BS arguments pale.

Oaks has [Vowed to refuse marriage licenses](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/07/29/candidate-utah-county-clerk-says/) to same sex couples in Utah County, and that should be all you need to know about him.

Does anyone else believe wythe county is the worst county in VA? They baby an old building for an old presidents wife (Bolling Wilson Hotel) and act like we are some classy town. Its one of the biggest Hotspots for opioids (no fault of the people) and absolutely terrible healthcare and low paying jobs (unless you want to drive an hour each way to and from work). They are closing down a dialysis center in Wytheville while agreeing to use our tax money to install a hockey arena at the apex center that was a flop (it doesn't have paved parking or any indication how to get to it. You literally drive in between 2 ultra busy gas stations to get to it without really knowing if you're going the right way). Maybe I'm just a Debbie downer. Maybe I'm just an A-hole.

Hello Vermonters! Flatlander here. My husband (a Bennington native) and I are considering purchasing a great house up a steep(ish) hill. My 4x4 got up it just fine in sleet/icy conditions no problem, but the road is very narrow and steep with a drop-off on one side. My concern is going in to this without any idea of what our road maintenance responsibilities are. There is no formal agreement in place - only a “handshake agreement “ for plowing in the winter. I noticed the road was covered with a heavy gravel type substance one time, so sanding must be part of that agreement with the plow driver. What happens when there are heavy rains and ruts form? Do I just worry about our portion of the road? Of course the 3 other houses are higher up than us - so I am worried that we will bear the majority of the responsibility to maintain the road at its steepest parts. (which is in front of the house we are considering). We are up for an adventure but don’t want to go in to this in complete ignorance. Your advice is appreciated!! Thank you 🙏 |Vermont|2018|False|0

"We've seen daily updates of Covid stats on here while we were setting records.  However, now that the news is good (we do like good news, right?), the updates from the negative people has stopped. So, I've decided it would be nice to add a good news post.  This is the status of three important metrics: Total cases, Deaths and Hospitalizations.

**Cases**: Overall cases are still trending up slightly.  However, peak case number was on June 12 and testing positives has been holding steady in the 8-10% range.

**Deaths**: The death numbers and death rate continue to drop.  This is a stat that is obvious at the national level as well as in NC.  

**Hospitalizations**: At 843 today, it is the lowest number since 829 on June 16 and has been trending down since the peak of 915 on June 23.  Total and ICU beds are looking stable and plenty available.

I'll be the first to admit that I don't know which way it will go from here.  There are many things that could have contributed to the positive trend in the statistics.  But, it is good to at least see that, at least so far, the reopen and protests have not put us in the dire shape that some have been predicting.

"Hey, not sure if this is the right place to post - but I've been looking around for a short term rental (june to august-ish). Very common dates, I know. 

I've been up to Maine a few times and it's always been a draw to me. I'm most familiar with Rockport, Portland, Acadia area, Bangor, Belfast, and a few other spots. I have a few friends from *the deep south of the far north* too, so I've heard a bit about the ins and outs.

Anyways, I'm looking for a short term rental near the water and was wondering if there are any sites that go by monthly (vrbo, etc all go daily). Or if anyone has any tips on areas. I'd like to be somewhere quiet, but not totally recluse - like near a town with a bar or two and a grocery store. Also being somewhat near an ice rink would be pretty cool. 

So I guess my main questions are if there are any sites besides craigslist or vrbo for short term rentals and what areas I should check out.

Thanks, and sorry if these types of posts are frowned upon here.

Trail Dames is a hiking club for women of a curvy nature. However, all women are welcome! The Dames are a group of women who are looking for a chance to get out and see the beauty that this world has to offer. We hike relatively slowly, enjoying every second, because we know that it is not the destination that is important, but the journey. If you are concerned that you are too old, too out of shape, too curvy to keep up, you need not worry. We stop frequently, laugh a lot and are committed to creating an experience of celebrating nature and each other. All Trail Dames hikes are chosen with beginners in mind, and are do-able by everyone!

"Hello Reddit

We have a serial pooper and an amazon package thief in our apartment complex. 
For the last year and a half, we have throughout our apartment complex had someone who enjoys defecating in the walkways.
Our apartment complex has not done anything to resolve this.
  
Last week an amazon package was stolen from the front door of my apartment.  My neighbor has a ring camera and we reviewed the footage we noticed this one middle aged caucasian male that always walks around our complex at odd hours.  He was the only person near our door on the ring camera after amazon notified us that a package was delivered.  I was even angrier to find out it was a resident.

Coincidentally, the next day I stepped outside to go get a coffee and lo and behold, this same person was walking by my front door.  They were extra talkative to me.  I immediately confronted them about the stolen package.  They seemed very nervous and couldn’t get their story straight.  I demanded that they return our package.  When I got back from getting coffee, the package was there.

The next day, someone defecated in our walkway.  The serial pooper struck again.  
I am convinced this package thief is also the serial pooper and this was a retaliation for being caught.
Thus far, our apartment complex, Tamarron apartments, has done nothing to resolve this.  They did not answer my emails.  When I went into the office to discuss this with them they tried to give canned responses.  They still have not even had the feces cleaned up.  Outrageous.

It’s really frustrating.  I have purchased a blink camera that now keeps an eye out from our window.

Since I’ve adopted her she has been attacked five times by other dogs; three at the dog park - other dog owners were on their phones, myself and other people had to break up the fights- and twice on our walk in our neighborhood. We do not go to the dog park anymore, and we avoid parts of our neighborhood. I used a dog trainer when I first adopted her and things were going well, no aggression towards other dogs. Fast forward to now and she is aggressive towards dogs over resources like food, toys, and her space. Does anyone know of a reputable dog trainer here in the valley? Thanks!|phoenix|2023|False|0

"Curious about /r/Australia's comments about former Prime Ministers getting their payments after serving for a certain amount of time, I wondered if there was an equivalent for the NT, and what the terms were.

[This is the document I looked up](http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/members-of-parliament/Guide_to_Members_Entitlements.pdf): ""Guide to Members Entitlements.""

Page 6 of 19 states:

> **2.2 Resettlement Allowance** 


> An allowance is provided to a retiring or defeated Member who meets the following criteria [Clause 15, RTD, section 4AA AMSORE and Chief Minister’s Determination tabled 26 May 2016]. If:

>• the Member was elected at or after the general election of 2005;

>• the Member will not receive a pension or superannuation benefit related to service in the Assembly immediately after ceasing to be a Member;

>• the Member has not been disqualified from continuing as a member due to a
conviction for an offence resulting in imprisonment for 12 months or longer as per
section 21 of the *Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978*

>• the Member has not been elected to another Australian parliament.

> The Resettlement Allowance is equal to one month of basic salary for each year served as a Member of the Assembly with a minimum of four months and a maximum equivalent to 12 months. It is payable at the rate of basic salary applicable on the date the Member is taken to have retired.

So if a person serves for over 4 years, they get 4 months worth of a basic salary, one month for one year. If they were elected after 2005.

Above this part, in 2.1:

> **2.1 Level of Basic Salary**

> From 1 January 2016, the basic salary of a Member is $153,312 subject to normal taxation rates paid fortnightly in arrears.

I'm not very good at math, but before tax, $153,312 over 12 months is $12,776 a month. The *minimum* is four months, so at a minimum, the NT Tax Payer is giving these guys $51,104.

If they served longer, they get more, to a maximum of 12 years. If they act as Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Opposition Whip, they're still serving and will get $153,312 a year, plus more. You can see the additional salary on Page 7, and then Electorate Allowances on Page 8.

With all this money flying around, I hope the newly elected Parliament does a good job, and doesn't waste public money for another 4 years."|darwin|2016|False|0

"I'm looking at moving pretty soon and would really appreciate any recommendations for apartment buildings in or around the city. 

I work in the CBD so pretty flexible as to which direction I live. First choice would be South Brisbane but there's not many options in my price range, so having to expand the search to more suburbs. 

I prefer a modern high rise building, and my main requirement is an oven (I don't have one now, and it kills me). 

Got a few viewings booked for next week, including the Peppers building in the Valley, which on paper sounds ideal but the reviews concern me.

If anyone can point me in any other directions, I'd really appreciate it! 

Also, if anyone has tips on the questions to ask at a viewing, let me know. This is my first time not looking for a place on flatmates so I'm a newbie.

"Okay guys, I'm in the market to build my 1st home. But I'm in a bit of a pickle. I have a price range of max around 450k that's all I'm comfortable looking at going into debt with. So that limits my options. So does my preference for Northside, I've no interest south of the river. And I'm building, the grants just make things a lot more feasible for me as a single guy. 

So I'm in a predicament. I can either spend 400-450k in the likes of Caboolture/Morayfield/Upper Caboolture for 600m2 house and land. Or I can spend 400-450k in Narangba/North Harbour/Dakabin/Kallangur/Griffin et Al house and land on max 400m2.

I'm hesitant to bite the bullet with Caboolture as I grew up in the area and really didn't want to go back to there but the price and land size is enticing. 

I like Narangba area have friends that live in the area and it's quite nice in the their little areas.

I did consider apartments but I wouldn't really qualify for the grants, and for me to afford to buy I would need the grants, and with the way the grants are worded I wouldn't qualify. And I'm not sure many places do low deposit loans for apartments anyway. 

I am considering putting it off and saving more, but cost of rent and living us just making it an extremely slow slog and the rise in house prices outstrips my ability to save.

"Im going to ask legal aid tomorrow but ill ask here as well, the father of 2 of my younger siblings is threatening to call police to come to the house and forcibly remove possessions of those siblings that are in this house. Up until my mother died on the 8th of this month, they lived 95% of the time here, and i am already in contact setting up legal aid to dispute him going for full custody (there are many various reasons such as criminal history and previous restraining orders etc. against him for this). My mother and he were NOT in any form of relationship for 7+ years before her death, so there is no de facto relationship stuff for him to claim.

The father of those 2 only had visitation every 2nd weekend, since her death he has kept them away from this house. (he came over the days he died and took them, did it while we were all in shock from her death still, claiming it was overnight.) Honestly if i wasnt so overwhelmed by everything (im only 22) i would have stopped him taking them, but i wasnt mentally aware of what was going on from it all.



So basically, he is demanding all of their clothes that we keep here for them (they were all bought by mum, and as her next of kin, basically belong to me now) He is harassing me and my father through calling and texts claiming he is coming over to get them and bringing the police as we are 'illegally withholding their possessions'. As stated though we are going through legal aid to get custody ourselves, and believe that it all should remain in the household for when they are back here, or even if they just visit. 

As this time he is claiming to hold court orders confirming his current full custody but also refuses to show them to us. As it has only been 3 weeks since her death, i and my social worker find this unlikely unless he lied to court about our wish to have part/full parental rights."|brisbane|2017|False|0

"Hi everyone, 

My partner just got offered a job at John Hopkins Childrens (Baltimore) and we are hoping to move from Missouri to Maryland soon. I was wanting to check in for a few things with the locals. 

-My partner and I will be making 139k gross (this is a bump in our income). Would Maryland be nice to us on that salary? We don’t want to live paycheck to paycheck. Savings is definitely something we want to continue. We know there will be a sticker shock compared to Missouri for sure. We are in STL right now.
-With John Hopkins being Baltimore, is it safe? The shifts are at night so we want to make sure it’s not funky. 
-We are trying to find a suburb which is decently close to John Hopkins and where we can rent a 1bd1bth for under $1600. Is that possible? 
-Safety of course for where we live. 
-We have two cars with us. Upon some research I found out MD title transferring is crazy expensive (north of $1000). We have a 10 year old sedan and a 5 month old SUV. 
-No kids for now. Will probably have 1 in the next 1.5-2 years
-We love food and would love a good food scene. Love nature so hiking trails and parks etc are wonderful. 
-Ideally would want to rent for 2 years and if we like MD, get a house. We are not into the whole big house thing. So a good condo or townhome would be good for us. 

Reasons to leave MO
-It’s very red (STL is purple yes) but we are hoping to be somewhere BLUE. 
-School districts are rough overall
-Proximity to a major airport. MDs access to IAD is great. I at least travel 2 times a year international and have family fly in 1-2 times. STL has an international airport but it’s for name only. The major airport really helps in cutting down travel time and cost. 

The internet so far has been very mixed on our gross total salary and being able to live in MD. I am hoping to get some clarity if this is even a good move. 

Thanks in advance!!

"Hey reddit,

My husband and I were talking about a stray dog we found in late 2018 (sometime after August, I don't remember exactly when), and realized that someone here might know him.

We were about a block from the Siff Uptown at about 10pm one night when we found a dog by himself without a collar or license. The dog was one of the friendliest, chillest dogs I'd ever met. If I didn't have cats, I would become a dog person and adopted him on the spot.

The vet and pet shop were closed, so we couldn't check for a microchip or get a leash. Another couple saw us and they had a rope, but they didn't have a car to take him to the all night vet. We did, so our powers combined, we were a full grown adult capable of dealing with the situation (if you were the other couple, and wondered how it turned out, it turned out great thanks to you. Thank you!)

As they were going to get the rope, the dog wandered across the street to the gas station on Queen Anne and Denny. That felt weird, because he'd been happy to hang out with  us and get pets before then (thankfully, it was late enough that there weren't any cars). He parked himself in front of the door and cried a little.

I tried to apologize to the guy at the gas station, that it wasn't my dog, but he was nice. The guy said he knew the dog. He was  a homeless guy's dog\*. According to the gas station clerk, the homeless guy stole some beer from the gas station and since it's easier to find ""guy with dog"" than ""guy,"" he ditched the dog. The dog kept sitting in front of the door, waiting.

The couple came back with a rope to use as a leash and I grabbed the car. We drove him to the 24-hour vet and he was scared (it seemed like his first time in a car), but he didn't snap or bark. The vet helped us figure out what to do with him overnight until the shelter opened in the morning.

We didn't think to take a picture, but one of the vet techs sent us this one. We called him Dave Grohl on the surrender form (because Nirvana was on the radio on the ride over and he was So. Chill.), but a coworker who was a shelter volunteer heard he got adopted out almost immediately with the name Seamus. We texted the vet tech who ALSO tried to adopt the dog, but didn't get her landlord to agree to letting her keep a dog fast enough. By the time she got there, he already had a home. Literally everyone who met this dog at every step of this story wanted to adopt him, he was that great of a dog.

Like I said, last I heard, he was adopted out as Seamus. If you know him, I'd love to hear how he's doing.

TLDR: We brought a stray puppy to the shelter in late 2018 and I was wondering how he's doing.

\*Please don't villify the guy. Addiction and homelessness are rough and he'd obviously done a great job of socializing him. Part of me still feels bad that I couldn't reconnect them, but that night, we were trying to do what was best for the dog, and right then, that was a steady stream of food and shelter.

"Some more info:

Just got my first utilities bill. Water/Sewage/Trash/Gas is billed through the leasing company so I have no insight into the actual numbers. Leasing office is closed today, and I fully intend to ask them the same question, but figured I'd try and get some info and maybe some answers online.

I have an electric stove, and my heating is through a heat pump. I have three potential guesses as to why I was charged for gas, but all of it seems like kind of BS, not sure how they will spin this. My guesses are that they charge all apartments for gas because some apartments have a gas fireplace (I don't), it's for gas that _might_ be used for heating common areas, it's for gas that _might_ be used to centrally heat water before it's distributed, but I also have a hot water meter so idk.

The charge also indicates that it's for 12/01-12/31 but I only moved in halfway through the month, so that's also BS.

&nbsp;

Anyone know if there is a way to get the specific meter readings for water/gas that were used to calculate the bill? My PSE account just shows electric. I'll ask all these questions tomorrow to the leasing office, but this post is also my way of ranting a bit, appreciate you good people listening.

"I'm moving to the Wilmington area and am house shopping.  Recently saw a townhouse in Midtown Brandywine.  I'm debating between living in that area or instead going for a peaceful, boring, expensive house in the suburbs.

The appeal of Wilmington (specifically Midtown Brandywine or Trolley Square) is that it is much more affordable to get a high quality house/townhouse.  The suburbs of DE are loaded with god awful cookie cutter housing monstrosities.  Additionally, I have read that Midtown Brandywine is a nice little community, and Trolley square is accessible from there and is hip/etc...

But for the most part, you read that Wilmington DE is a total goddamn disaster.  Sure, there are a few nice neighborhoods, but for the most part the city is overburdened with crime, often violent.  Therefore, if you choose to live in Wilmington, you go for one of the nice areas and avoid the others like the plague (and hope that occasional spillover violence doesn't get you).  There are new articles about the new mayor trying to revitalize the city, but it's not clear that there is any trend in the right direction.

I'm all for giving a city a chance, but I don't want to be afraid to leave my townhouse, or accidentally turn the wrong corner and get stabbed.  It doesn't bother me so much that Wilmington has a reputation for being boring; the crime does bother me though.

"Hi Reddit,

I'm a travel journo that visited Hawaii late last year and am wanting to feature this amazing food truck paradise that I found in Waikiki.

I can't for the life of me remember what it's called, except that it's got an Ohana Burger there and an outdoor seating area with red umbrellas. I've got a picture that I snapped.

Can anybody tell me what this food truck lot is called (if it has a name) and where it's located? Of if there are is any information you can offer about this place?

"Hey there,

I’m the person who asked what is was like for trans ppl in South Dakota. Definitely staying away from rural areas, but I think Rapid City should be ok for people like me. I don’t really have a choice in moving haha, so I’ll have to go to SD either way.

Anyways, for people who go to WDT, what’s it like? What programs/majors are you in? How do you like them? Are there other trade schools near Rapid City that you’d suggest?

Any advice would be appreciated :) I’m thinking of going into a construction major/program. I’ve always loved doing stuff hands on and especially building stuff.

"I am ashamed this absolute piece of shit represents Maine. He’s been nothing but disappointing, and his past comments on the “radical left” and student loan forgiveness were just further proof he isn’t interested in policy to benefit Mainers or even is aligned with his party— he totes the line to stay in power and masquerades as a democrat. 

He’s against student loan forgiveness but had no qualms with his wife taking out huge PPP loans that were forgiven. 

He was against tighter gun laws and regulations until the shooting in Lewiston.  

He has declared he thinks Trump will win and that he’s fine with it.

He is one of 12 democrats who haven’t endorsed Kamala for president despite her being the clear front runner, was quoted saying he will not commit to voting for her in November bc he’s a “free thinker,” and explicitly criticized her while over the border crisis. Biden/Harris can’t snap their fingers and change the asylum seeker or immigration laws, that’s the job of Congress— why isn’t he acting more assertively in congress, then?

 He said he will not endorse Kamala until she shows him how she will benefit his district— bc project 2025 and the man telling people at rallies there will be no more voting ever again if he’s elected will clearly help the people, especially the seniors who will lose all their benefits, in Maine.

I live in Maine and need new heating system. I am looking at switching over to natural gas and looking at the wall hung units. My question is where I would not be using heat for approximately 4-5 months out of the year should I just get new separate heat pump hot water heater instead of the combination gas unit wall hung combo that does hot water. I am getting very different recommendations from professionals. My goal would be to get as much life out of wall hung unit as possible but also have the most efficient energy.

"Hello,

I hate asking for help but my cousin David really needs it. He and my uncle lived together in Cumberland and when my uncle got sick, David stayed home and took care of him. My uncle received care through Medicaid as he was in his 70's and was not able to work. Unfortunately, my uncle died and has left David with the burden of having to pay back the $110k of his medical bills. The reason is this was David's childhood house and it is his home. In order to keep his home, David has to pay this or the Estate Recovery will take everything. They do not care that David does not have the money or that is his home. They do not care that it will leave him homeless. My family has gathered as much as we can but we need more to help him. Any amount is truly appreciated.

"So, I'm planning a long weekend for early September, like the weekend after Labor Day. Probably 10-15 dudes. Everybody lives pretty close to Wilmington or in Philadelphia. We're all middle-class, 30-year-old white dudes, but no one's really raking in tons of cash at this point. We're on a budget of maybe $400 - $500 total per person for the whole weekend. So - a total estimated budget of between $4000 - $7500 for everything (food/drink/lodging/travel/activities). 

We're pretty adventurous. We all like to drink and smoke a little pot. A few of us have dabbled in psychedelics. I've been to a few strip clubs, but I don't consider myself a ""strip club guy,"" and I don't really have any intentions of cheating on my fiancée. It's a fairly physically active group overall, so I'm not opposed to some light physical activity. Maybe paintball? 

I want to keep the travel time to a minimum, so maybe a 2-3 hour drive in any direction. I'm ruling out flying anywhere.

**Some of the things I am considering are:**

-Renting a beach house in Wildwood or Avalon

-Renting a lake house in the Pocano's 

-Renting a bay-front house on the eastern shore of Maryland 


**Some things I'm ruling out:**

-A weekend in Philly, since a bunch of people already live there, and we've done it before 

-Atlantic City, since I spent five years working in a casino and I'm over it



Any recommendations for locations or activities would be greatly appreciated!

"I am fairly new transplant to MN - and live in Scott County. I have a first time middle schooler - and his school informed us they do not offer any after school care.

When I called the school, the administrative seems surprised I'd need this service, almost insinuating he's old enough to stay by himself (This is my first child at this age - so I really don't know what's normal). He does have a iPhone. He also can walk easily from the bus stop to our house.  I just feel like thats a drastic change for him but looks like we are running out of options.  

What have other parents done? Is this normal in MN? Any suggestions or feedback?

In fact, just days ago, I got downvoted in here for saying let's become a community again and support each other. Politics are politics. These two parties that most of you support are driving us nowhere but into the ground. 

This rant began after watching the ""confirmation hearing"" of RFK Jr. Watching that debacle, of ranting and raving, no questions asked just statements, no interest in his answers. Just mouth flapping. The Democrats trying to hold his hard line on abortion. The Republicans trying to hold the same line on abortion. As if this is the only goddamn thing Iills our society. Or what did you say about a vaccine on a podcast 6 years ago. Well my kids are all vaccinated, we don't care about that. What about this podcast?

All of this absolute nonsense going on, as someone who comes down the center and says we need to focus on why Americans are not healthy. They grow up on bad foods, they develop diseases, and this puts a tremendous strain on all the healthcare that we have in this country. Someone just trying to say that simple thing, is railroaded. By both sides just to push an agenda. And increase outrage. 

Wake up people. These people who you elect to represent us represent nothing, but corporate interests, and their own pocketbooks. Set your differences aside, and start trying to lean into listening to the other side.

What you see represented is what I walk a day, compared to the average 40-year-old American. As you will see, the average 40-year-old American walks less than 5,000 steps a day. We are fat, we are unhealthy, we don't exercise, and we eat horrendous chemicals through our food. Wake up.

* 1 dried (small) New Mexico Pepper (seeded)
* 1 ancho (small) (did not seed)
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1T brewed soy sauce (I like light to cook with, dark is for dipping sauces)
* 1T fish sauce
* 1/2 cup AP flour
* 3/4 stick delicious butter
* 1T chili powder (or more, to taste)
* 1T olive oil
* 1 14.5oz can of ""tomato sauce""
* 1 bottle Miller Lite
* 2 cups water
* Salt to taste
* Black pepper to taste

In Dutch oven smash ground chuck into single layer on bottom of DO. Barely cover with water and cook on low, go watch cartoons and now and then stop by to mix and break up chunks with a whisk.

Repeat with ground pork. Drain both in colander for 5-10 minutes.

Add both to food processor and pulse a couple of times until completely broken up and sort of fine. Put mix back in bowl.

Seed New Mexico pepper and bust up Ancho. Add to small saucepan with chicken broth and simmer at low until peppers are fully hydrated and mushy.

Take remaining vegetables and jam them into food proc. Seed jalapeno and Fresno peppers and remove that white stuff. Leave them in for additional heat. Add chili powder. Add teaspoon of salt/pepper. Pulse until finely chopped.

In same DO, sauté veg mix in olive oil until soft and rawness cooked out of powder. Add soy and fish sauce. Looking for a nice rich brown. Liquids should be completely cooked down and incorporated into veg mix. Deglaze with 1/4 bottle of beer.

Add back to food proc. Add peppers/chicken broth to food proc. Process until pureed. No vegetable textures are wanted, only flavor.

Pre-heat oven to 350. Wipe down DO. Add butter and melt over low heat. Whisk in flour. Cook roux over low heat until flour and butter are fully incorporated. It should be about the consistency of toothpaste with a slight sheen from the butter. Not clumpy. Cook in oven until beige-ish. You don't want a gumbo roux.

Remove from oven and back onto low heat. Add puree. Add meat mix. Add can of sauce. Add remaining beer. Add 1 cup water. Mix until all fully incorporated.

Watch 3 episodes of Rick & Morty. Chili is now ready to serve. At Lindy's, they serve it with finely shredded mild cheddar, finely chopped fresh onion, and a dollop of sour cream. I don't like crackers because I fell like they dilute flavor, so to hell with those. Use the green parts from your green onions if you are cheap, because that's what I did, because I am.

THERE IS NO GODDAMN CUMIN IN THIS RECIPE. DON'T DO IT.

The offer was about $55,000 mexican pesos a month, which translates to approx. $2,500 usd a month. (Payment would be in USD)

Also since tensions rise between both countries, is it a good time to move to USA? It would include a work visa of course.

"Hey all! 

I visited Hobart for a weekend earlier this year, and really enjoyed my time! I'm in dire need of a break over the Xmas/ny period, and was contemplating spending my leave in Tassie! I have a bunch of niggling questions: 
- What's it like over the break period, people-wise? Is it hectic?
- Do the national parks often get closed due to weather? (I'm guessing less likely to have fires in the upcoming season due to La Nina/+ IOD?). 
- I don't particularly care for Christmas, but I'd assume a lot of places would be closed - do they close national parks on Xmas?
- I am partial to fireworks on NYE... I'm guessing Hobart would be best? Or any other NYE location suggestions?
- any other recommendations you've got for travelling at this time of year? Should I come over this period? Or is there a better time? My partner and myself are restricted really to this break as far as leave goes unfortunately...

When I was here I did the Salamanca Markets, MONA and Pt Arthur, I'll definitely do MONA again, loved it! But the other two I'd be happy to forego! I think I'd rather spend my time in Tassie out and about away from Hobart, so any tips or advice I'd be super appreciative!

"I found a cassette tape titled 'Random Notes live - Caribbean Room 23/11/86'.  I remember the band, because I was in it, and I even remember this venue, at least the playing in it part, but I don't remember exactly where it was.  I know it was in Salamanca Place, and it was on the top floor of one of the pubs on one of the corners, because I remember lugging gear up and down the stairs.   Anyone remember anything more than that?

One thing I do remember about The Caribbean Room: we got a residency there on Friday and Saturday nights. This was  cool, because we got to take the door, which meant we actually made money for a change.  But it fucked up big time when we couldn't make a Friday night for some reason.

"...And I need you guys' opinions. 

So I sold my car before I moved here a few months ago, because 1. it was getting old and I figured it made more sense financially to just buy a new one instead of spending $$$ to ship it across the country, and 2. everybody would tell me horror stories about how often they got parking violations, and how they would add up to almost a car payment every month. So I figured I would try things out without a car at first, and get myself established before I considered getting one. I've been taking the bus/train everywhere, and don't really mind, it's only $100/month and I never have to worry about parking. 

But now i'm considering a new transportation method. I was thinking about getting a Vespa instead of a car. My S/O has a car and we live together, but he has work, etc and I have school, so we each have our own schedules during the week, but on the weekends he does all of the driving :) So the Vespa would just be a weekday transportation method for me, to and from school, and maybe weekend beach strolls. 

Any thoughts/opinions/tips?

"I am fairly new transplant to MN - and live in Scott County. I have a first time middle schooler - and his school informed us they do not offer any after school care. I have tried to search for after school care but I am only getting daycares for small children. My child isn't interested in any of the sports offerings and is planning on a few evening activities offered by community ed - but while we are working we aren't sure where he could go between 2-6 pm. 

When I called the school, the administrative seems surprised I'd need this service, almost insinuating he's old enough to stay by himself (This is my first child at this age - so I really don't know what's normal). He does have a iPhone. He also can walk easily from the bus stop to our house.  I just feel like thats a drastic change for him but looks like we are running out of options.  

What have other parents done? Is this normal in MN? Any suggestions or feedback?

"Hi! So, a little background: I currently live in central Indiana with my husband. We have a 2.5 year old daughter and a baby due to arrive in August. My husband was just told last week his company is shutting down and he will be out of a job in 60 days. However, the parent company really likes him and would like to keep him. This means a raise, a sign on bonus, and relocation. Their current opening is in Lumberton, NC. I started doing research and read it’s the most dangerous city in the state. I also have read some really positive reviews that it’s a great small town, friendly people, southern hospitality, etc. 

If the job is offered we will certainly visit - but I am too anxious to wait. What do you know about Lumberton? Will I be okay to put my kids in the public schools? Will it be safe for me to take my kids to the park, out and about during the day while my husband is at work?

I am from Indianapolis. I am not a stranger to high crime and watching my surroundings, but I also know the city like the back of my hand so I know where to avoid or be extra cautious. With moving out of state, I just worry about moving with my two little babies to a “dangerous” city I know nothing about. 

If you don’t recommend Lumberton, are there any surrounding cities you think are family friendly? How is Fayetteville? We are middle class, and my husband is willing to commute up to 45 minutes.

Our backup plan was him to title it in NY and then sell it to me and then I'll title it here, but that just sounds like extra steps. It needs to be titled to me and registered in state for me to add it to my insurance."|Tennessee|2021|False|0

Anytime there's traffic near the airport, the solution seems to drive through Airport Dr and crawl through the airport, where there's more intersections, more traffic lights and larger vehicles.

We were close, started our university degree together (Software Eng. - Monash Clayton) in 2003.

I visited him in the Alfred, and a while later (unsure of time, could be months to a year or so) in a private hospital/care facility in Ivanhoe - both times he was unconscious/in a coma.

I know:

* his name
* background was South African/Indian
* he was from Apendale Gardens (area-ish)
* finished highschool in 2002 (not necessarily in Aspendale Gardens)
* his dad was also in the accident, but IIRC his inuries weren't as bad
* back sometime in 2003-6 I remember searching (online) for him and finding a local church article on him - this is how I may have found out about his stay in the Ivanhoe Hospital

North Dakota
Political control: North Dakota has a legislature dominated by Republicans who want to ban abortion, and the GOP governor had hoped to see Roe v. Wade wiped off the books in favor of state's rights.

Background: The state has passed some of the nation's strictest abortion laws, including one that would have banned abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can happen before a woman knows she is pregnant. The law never took effect because the state's lone abortion clinic successfully challenged it in court. One failed Republican proposal would have charged abortion providers with murder with a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Effect of Supreme Court ruling: North Dakota has a trigger law that will shut down the state's sole abortion clinic in Fargo after 30 days. That 2007 state law makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless necessary to prevent the pregnant woman's death or in cases of rape or incest. Violators could be punished with a five-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.

What's next: The owner and operator of the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo said she would explore all legal options to ensure abortion services are available in North Dakota. Should that fail, clinic leader Tammi Kromenaker plans to move across the river to Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion has not been outlawed. Planned Parenthood says it can provide abortions in Moorhead until Kromenaker gets up and running."|NorthDakota|2022|False|0

"Hey /r/LosAngeles,

I'm looking for someone who would be able to foster two adult cats (11-12years) for two months. They've been staying in an office for the past month and before that in a tall kennel. They belong to my sister and I and we've been going twice every day to clean and feed them but unfortunately this month is the last month they can be there. After my father passed away in late June I've been trying to find a place to live for myself and them. A good majority of rooms in the area don't allow pets. My mother is going to be moving into a house at the end of November where we'll be able to keep them. Everything is already signed for the house so we're trying to hold onto the cats until then. I'm willing to provide all the supplies they need. 
They've been indoor cats all their lives. The black one(female) usually slept with me. The boy does have a behavioral problem that I've noticed in the last few months where he'll use the litter box but pee right outside of it. I've seen the vet about this and there seems to be no infection. It could be because of the new surroundings. For this reason I'm hoping they'll be able to stay in someone's back yard for less of a mess and problem. I have paperwork for all their shots and they're spayed and neutered. They really only have until tomorrow and we've called around on local facebook groups for pet boarding but no luck so far.

"I'll keep it brief,

I work for a Virginia country club that closed down mid-March due to COVID (I work in the childcare section within the rec center). They did not furlough us but offered to continue paying us until we were allowed to come back.

It kind of sucked to see everyone around me making bonkers dough off unemployment but there was nothing I could do.

So anyways, cut to late May when I get the notice we are reopening for Phase 2 the first week of June. They send out a message saying leave pay will cease the 31st of the month—as everyone in the rec center returns to work on the 1st. However, my chill boss informs me our section is not opening until the 9th. I text the higher-ups asking if this means there will be a gap in wages. No response.

So—here's a critical piece of the puzzle: there's a weird mandatory orientation the Friday before we return (keep in mind this is the gap week). It's basically us, a few college kids, standing around with our hands in our pockets waiting around for a higher-up to briefly explain the obvious (the importance of hand sanitizer and washing hands). It seemed normal enough at the time, but in retrospect, I think this was arranged as a formality to possibly gain legal leverage (which I'll explain now)...

Basically I get back and receive a paycheck at the end of my first week. The gap week is not included in my pay. I am told by my boss to just swallow the cost and basically implies I should dawn an attitude that whatever the higher-ups do or say goes. My co-worker doesn't seem to mind or care either (to be honest, their apathetic reactions make me feel like maybe this is only affecting me, but who knows?)

I walk to the main house after my shift and ask if I can get paid for those hours or if I should just claim them on unemployment. She says I can't file them for unemployment because technically I did work that week (Friday, the orientation). I point out the obvious—a few hours and a week's wages are two different things. She says she'll look into it.

So basically she is saying the club won't compensate me but also that I can't claim unemployment because of a suspiciously BS orientation I am now convinced she orchestrated for this reason. Is she right? Or can I claim that week?

I actually forgot to clock-in for the orientation if that makes a difference haha.

I make 14 an hour so this money is legit like my rent/food money for me. Their attitude has been very discarding so I hope there's some positivity at the end of this tunnel.

Thanks for taking your time to read this,

John

TLDR; my employer, who continued to pay us during quarantine, did not include the final week in my paycheck.

"Full Article:

The viral, rash-causing and headline-grabbing disease that was first diagnosed in Fairbanks in 2015 is getting a new name: borealpox.

Known up to now as Alaskapox, the disease is caused by a virus in the orthopox family that includes smallpox and other pox viruses.

There are only seven known cases to date, six in Fairbanks that resulted in relatively mild effects that resolved on their own and one on the Kenai Peninsula that led to the death of an elderly man whose immune system was weakened after treatments for cancer.

News of the name change came from Katherine Newell, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiology field officer working at the Alaska Department of Health, who spoke at a conference hosted by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.

“We are changing the name of Alaskapox virus to borealpox virus, which is what it will now be known as from now on,” Newell said in a presentation Tuesday at the Alaska Tribal Conference on Environmental Management held in Anchorage.

There are two reasons for the name change, which is already shown on the Alaska Department of Health’s website and is expected to be made official in coming weeks by the CDC and the World Health Organization, she said.

One reason is scientific. While the discovery is new and the only cases found to date have been in Alaska, there is mounting evidence that the virus has been circulating in populations of small mammals for decades – and is expected to be in boreal regions beyond Alaska.

“While we’re only had cases to date in Fairbanks and now in Kenai, it’s likely that this virus probably is endemic throughout most of the state, if not the state, and also into Canada and potentially other regions as well,” Newell said.

The fatal Kenai case, which elevated Alaskapox from a scientific curiosity into a more serious issue, provided some key evidence about the wider range. The virus identified there was different genetically from the virus found in the Fairbanks area, indicating wider geographic dispersal over a longer timeframe.

Other evidence comes from the vast collection of northern animals kept at the University of Alaska Museum of the North.

Several of the museum’s northern red-backed vole specimens, including one collected more than 25 years ago from Denali National Park and Preserve, tested positive for the virus, said Link Olson, the museum’s curator of mammals and a former biology professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

“It’s been circulating for a while. How long is a while? No one knows,” said Olson, who was a coauthor of the scientific study that first described Alaskapox and the 2015 human case.

The second reason to change the name to borealpox is more philosophical. The WHO in 2015 took a stance against naming newly discovered human diseases after geographic areas to avoid unfair stigmas.

Geographic disease names can be inaccurate. That was famously the case for the influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 50 million people starting in 1918. Despite being first diagnosed in Kansas, that disease came to be known as the “Spanish flu.”

Some geographic disease names are already too entrenched to change, Newell said. Some examples are Ebola, first discovered near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo; West Nile virus, which first emerged in the West Nile district of Uganda; and Lyme disease, discovered in and around Lyme, Connecticut.

But the discovery and naming of Alaskapox and the virus that causes it is new enough that a name change can be made effectively, Newell said.

The WHO’s 2015 recommendations also advised against using animal names for newly discovered human diseases. Thus the disease originally known as monkeypox, to which Alaskapox is related, has now been officially renamed mpox.

For the Alaskapox/borealpox virus, red-backed voles and other small mammals scurrying around the forest appear to be the reservoir. But it took a few years to pin that down.

In 2015, after the first case was identified, Olson and Aren Gunderson, manager of the museum’s mammal collection, trapped some small mammals on the woodsy property where the patient had been living. None of the trapped animals tested positive for the virus.

In 2020 and 2021, after additional cases were identified, Olson, Newell and others fanned out into the woods in the Fairbanks area, where they trapped hundreds of small mammals of different species and tested them. Of the nearly 400 animals trapped and tested, 16% had antibodies showing past exposure to the virus and 5% had active infections of it, according to information presented by Newell at a CDC conference last year.

Northern red-backed voles dominated that group that tested positive, which made sense, Olson said.

Found in almost all of the state, they are extremely abundant — “one of Alaska’s most ubiquitous and common species,” according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s species profile – so a lot of them wound up in the traps the scientists used to detect virus presence in small mammals. They also have very short lifespans, generally no more than 12 months, so they might not have time to overcome any viral infections they acquire, leaving those viruses still active when the animals are tested.

There is no evidence that Alaskapox/borealpox has harmed the animals it infected, Newell said. Among the hundreds of small mammals trapped, there was not even a single lesion, she said.

As for potential harm to people, the virus was considered to pose little threat, at least until the fatal Kenai Peninsula case occurred.

In the six Fairbanks North Star Borough cases, initial signs of infection were lesions that resembled spider bites, she said. In those Fairbanks-area cases, all among otherwise healthy people, symptoms included fatigue, swollen lymph nodes and fever – possibly uncomfortable, but not dangerous. All the Fairbanks patients recovered, some within a few days, though the skin lesions took longer to heal completely, according to state information.

In the aftermath of the fatal case, the Alaska Division of Health’s epidemiology section issued a set of recommendations that include extra precautions for people with compromised immune systems. State epidemiologists are also urging more public awareness, prompt reporting of any suspected cases and careful behavior around wild animals.

There is no evidence that the virus can spread between people. Pet dogs and cats that mingle with or prey on infected wild animals are considered possible transmitters. The Fairbanks-area patients owned pets, and the Kenai Peninsula man who eventually succumbed to the virus had been caring for a stray cat before his symptoms emerged, state health officials have noted.

Much more investigation is planned, including an expedition this summer to the Kenai Peninsula to trap and test animals there, Newell said. More discoveries of the virus are expected, she said.

“Until we had our fatal case in January of this year, people probably weren’t looking for it much,” Newell said.

Many questions remain unanswered. Among them: What other animal species, including bigger and longer-lived species, are carrying the Alaskapox/borealpox virus? Is there a reason why infections are just now showing up in people – or were there human cases in the past that went undiagnosed? How widespread is the virus in space, time and across various animal species?

Olson, who has just sent 100 specimen samples up to 20 years old to the CDC for testing, suspects that investigation into the last question will reveal much wider reach than originally believed.

“We should have never called it ‘Alaskapox,’” he said. And though he had advocated for the borealpox name from the start, even that may wind up being obsolete, he said. “I’ll go on record predicting it’s probably not going to be limited to the boreal region.”"|Alaska|2024|True|0
"From 2000-2004 my elder cousin was a volunteer Firefighter in Fairbanks Ak. The station was right down the street from our house, not even a 5 min walk. When they'd get a call we could hear the alarm from our house, that was our cue. Any time of day or night, if we were home and heard the bell, we go to the station, you could just walk in. We would move all their stuff all over the place and find silly ways to mess with them, but we always left behind gifts like beer and candy along with ""thank you for your service"" messages on the white board.

""Alaska is facing an energy crisis, and AGDC is exploring every option to deliver a new, affordable, reliable, and long-term energy supply.

"We've been renting this place for 2 years now, renewing yearly. The lease will end around New Year's, but the property manager started asking in September (about 4 months in advance to the lease end!) whether we plan to renew. 

Yes we do, but she kept asking for how long and at what price. [Realestate.com.au](http://Realestate.com.au) and similar sites only show availability 6 weeks in advance; that will be mid-November. So we're over 2 months too early to get an idea of the market. I said so, but she keeps pushing. I proposed a 6 month renewal for the current price, she wants a higher price for 12 months. It starts to look on the higher side of current prices, but OK I guess to avoid the cost of moving. 

So I'm wanting to tell her that we're OK in principle with that offer, but we won't sign anything until mid-November when we can actually start to check the market, and to please piss off until then. 

**My question is:** how come they get so pushy *so early*? Can they do anything to force us to decide so early? I *imagine* they could get petty and somehow decide they don't want to renew us, but I *hope* that, just like the process of moving would be costly and uncomfortable for us, it would also be some friction for them, right? 

Even, is there anywhere I could complain about this pressure?

For context, this PM has always been starting the renewal process early and I always have had to push back a bit; last year it was 3 months early. But this is getting silly. 4 months!"|brisbane|2024|False|0

I also did Port Arthur and Cataract Gorge today.

"Hi Montanans! I'm from England, but a little over a hundred years ago my family decided to try and make it ""out West"" in the mines of Montana. What I know about their time here is, however, very limited and I was hoping than some of you might be able to shed any light on it.

In 1883 or 1884, my great-great-grandfather George Tuckett set sail from his home in Yorkshire (where he had been an iron miner) for Butte, Montana. Thereafter he appears in pretty much every town directory as a miner (or assistant) until 1901 or so. That included the Gagnon Mine (which I have found photos of) and also the ""Mt V"" mine - are any of you able to identify that particular abbreviation?

In 1885, my great-great-grandmother Annie took herself and their three children Alice (b. 1879), Elizabeth Anne (b. 1883) and George (b. 1884). It appears that little Elizabeth did not survive the journey, or otherwise died shortly after arriving.

Carrie Hammond Tuckett, my great-grandmother, was born in Montana in 1892 but three months later the family seems to have been split, with Carrie, Alice and their father George still there, but Annie and George Jr not. I surmise during this period Annie was in a lunatic asylum, perhaps with George. (Ten years later, back in England, she was again committed and her doctor noted her previous incarceration while in the States) - though I have no record of this and I would be very grateful if there was any way of verifying it.

George was naturalised as a US Citizen in 1894 followed by the birth of Nina Tuckett (b.1894) and Bert (b.1897). By 1901 Annie and the children (all?) appear to be back in England, though George is not - they are ""separated"" and it appears he thought twice about his marital status on the 1900 US Census. (The children, for their part, pretended to be Canadian for the 1901 UK census!)

I have only very incomplete records of what I know must be several transatlantic trips from Ancestry - would there be any other ways to verify comings and goings? I understand the 1890 census records are lost, and that birth/death records were not common at the time."|Montana|2017|False|0

On December 25, 2024, I was driving home from my girlfriend’s place when my car’s brakes locked up, causing the airbags to deploy and completely immobilizing the vehicle. I had to call a specialized tow truck to take it to my mechanic. I won’t even go into the full repair costs, but I’m looking at about $700 just for a new wheel and column.

This car was not only my daily transportation but also how I earned extra income through DoorDash and Uber. With the car out of commission, my side income has been completely wiped out. I even reached out to my father for help, but unfortunately, he’s unable to assist.

My rent ($1,800) is due on the 1st, along with my water and electricity bills, which total about $260. These are final notices, and I’ve already pushed them as far as I can without losing services. I do get paid on January 2nd, and I’ll be making close to $800, plus holiday pay and extra hours, which will bring my total to around $900. However, this will only be enough to cover the bills, basic essentials, and gas—not my rent.

I’ve been working 8-12 hours after my full-time job to try to make some extra money, but it’s barely enough to cover gas, let alone everything else. I don’t have many friends or family to turn to, so I’m at a loss for what to do.

I hate asking for help—it makes me feel embarrassed—but I’m out of options. If anyone can help in any way, I would truly appreciate it more than words can express. My CashApp is $pingodingo.

Thank you so much for reading this, and may God bless you all. Anything helps, and I’m beyond grateful for your kindness."|Florida|2024|False|0

Hi, I’m not with any shelters or anything and I’m not sure where else to put this but I’ve been searching for dogs since my other one passed suddenly and I’ve found a lot that are old or have special needs that need homes and I just feel so bad seeing them not have homes.

"At ~6:30 AM, my husband noticed that something was wrong with the small fish pond in our yard. The lily pads were torn, the usually crystal clear water was brown, and the 2 larger goldfish were nowhere in sight. We quickly realized that the larger fish (5"") were completely missing as were several other small fish (1-2""). The pond sits beneath an orange tree and our yard is secured by a 6' block wall. The fatalities occurred some time between 9PM and 6AM.

What murdered our fish? A hawk? A heron? A raccoon? (Do raccoons even live in Phoenix?) The neighbors's cat?

"I'm not sure if this is what this subreddit is for, but I thought I would try to post this in my state's subreddit.
If this doesn't fit this subreddit,I'll delete it. 

I live in Charleston, West Virginia. My neighbors, who have lived on my street for as long as I can remember, recently moved suddenly for an unknown reason, leaving behind two cats. One is an older cat, who would not be suitable for adoption as a family pet. Another neighbor is looking for a rescue group to take him. The other cat is Emma.
I don't know if Emma is her real name, but that's what I call her. She has medium to long black fur with chocolate highlights. She has short legs, but not as short as the legs of a cat of the Munchkin breed, although I think she may be part munchkin. She has white teeth, so I am assuming she is young, at the most one year. I don't know her health history, nor do I know if she was spayed. 
Emma is a very affectionate cat who purrs and follows me on walks. She gets along with the neighborhood cats but seems to have a fear of dogs. I think she was an indoor cat. I'm worried about how she will survive in the dangers of being outside. She doesn't deserve to live her life as a stray.

One of the main differences I noticed between cities like Milwaukee and Chicago is that Twin Cities freeways are more of a grid network than a hub and spoke network radiating from downtown which gives you more alternative routes. The next thing I noticed when I moved here was the proliferation of the cloverleaf interchange, a relic of 1950s highway design, and while Chicago still uses them in the exurbs, Milwaukee is upgrading the very last one to a diverging diamond. Initially, I thought, surely this isn’t the best idea for a city with icy winters, to have sharp curves with short distances for merging? Doing some nerdy research, I found this graphic, and I fell in love with it.

>""We're just going to try to get things done,"" she said.

>She said the DFL will move quickly in January to protect abortion access. Another priority will be what she called ""helping Minnesotans afford their lives"": money toward education, environmental protection, affordable housing and child care.

No mention of cannabis legalization at all.  I'm not sure if this is because she's actively avoiding the subject, its truly not a priority for her or whether its just a failure of journalism to not ask about one of the more talked about legislative issues.

My girlfriend is planning to move down from Connecticut with me in Austin but she is concerned about healthcare down here. Up in CT, she qualified for free state health insurance where she had no medical expenses. All of her prescriptions were free, doctors visits had no copays, dental was covered, and there was no deductible or monthly fees that she needed to pay. However after doing a bit of research, I can't find any information for similar programs down here. It seems like all public insurance plans require monthly payments and/or high deductibles.

# 🤔 So what’s this all about?

Over the next 6 weeks, we'll draft the *latest* Magic sets, go wild with *chaos drafts* (you can thank me later), and wrap it all up with a grand finale that’s more exciting than finding a Mythic rare in your pack (if that's possible). 

Here’s the best part: You don’t have to make it to every single week! Don’t stress if you miss one. Your lowest performing event is automatically dropped, including a missed event.

# PRIZES:

* **Top 4 at each table:** Win sweet, sweet prizes. I’m talking *cards, swag, maybe even a shiny new R*C car or something. Who knows?
* **Top 4 by overall points at the end of the league:** Cash prize! Who doesn’t love some extra loot? 💰
* **1st place overall:** In addition to the cash, you can win an **exclusive play mat**. Yes, it’s as cool as it sounds. ;)

We’ll also have giveaways, side contests, and other surprise prizes because we want to keep it fun, inclusive, and *sometimes a little chaotic...* just like Magic itself.

# WHY:

* **Community:** We’re not just a bunch of players, *we’re a community* of passionate people*.* I’m all about creating a welcoming space where new players can learn the ropes, and veterans can share their knowledge and compete. It’s about growth, mentorship, and making sure we’re all having a blast while we sling spells and crack packs.
* **No Pressure:** Whether this is your first draft or your 100th, this is for *everybody*. You play at your pace, and I promise, *you’ll feel at home*.
* **Mentoring is encouraged!** Got some drafting tips? Want to show off your ""sick combos""? I couldn't encourage it more.



**TL;DR**: The **Boise Magic Draft League** is a 6-week tournament where you draft new sets, crazy formats, chaos drafts, and drink beer at local breweries. You can win cash prizes, a cool playmat, and join a community of Magic players that you'll dig. We want you to be part of this! (Seriously, come play. It's going to be awesome. You don't want to miss it.)

"I just came across Boise Dev's ""[Treasure Valley Happy Hour Guide](https://boisedev.com/guides/happy-hour-guide-2/)"" article and thought it was pretty cool. But it reminded me of our last visit to Water Bear Bar's happy hour.

We got there right at 4 PM, and the music was upbeat but not overpowering. About 10 minutes later, though, the volume cranked up so much that the four of us were practically yelling to hear each other (and no, it's not because we're old). When we asked the server if they could turn the music back down, he flat-out said, ""No, we don't do that."" Seriously, does happy hour come with megaphones now?

If you know of any happy hour spots where you can actually hold a conversation without competing with the music, let me know!

so this happened not even 10 minutes ago, i was doordashing as i usually do when im bored. so im delivering an order and im driving down chinden about to turn on curtis then onto ustick. and i noticed something in the sky that just looked like a plane so i just ignored it. but taking a second glance i noticed it wasn't flashing like a normal plane would in the night. so i kept my eye on it while i was sitting at the light (for a total of about 2 minutes), it had strange flight patterns and it moved very quickly. one second it in the sky like a plane would be, and the next it's RIGHT ABOVE MY CAR! it's about 10 feet away from my windshield. it was a triangular shape orb and emitted a really bright green, i've never seen that shade of green in my entire life. i was mesmerised. typing this out now i wish i had taken a picture of it but i seriously couldn't take my eyes off it. what y'all think? |Boise|2024|False|0

"Starting August 1st, there will not be an in network insurance provider on the marketplace, that will have the nationally ranked Cincinnati Children's Hospital in network. This Hospital provides specialized care to thousands of children through out Ohio.  Care source marketplace plan has decided not to include them Cincinnati Children's as part of their in network plan.  This will result in the following 
1. Continuing with current doctors but paying significantly more out of pocket for care for their children
2. Switching doctors, possibly in the middle of care, and forcing parents to drive hours away for that care.
3. Just not getting the care their child needs because there is no one in network to provide it.

"As of this month the state is now not only a “stand your ground” state, but also permitless carry, meaning state-mandated training or a background check to legally carry guns is optional, and gun nuts also have the option to openly carry because God says it’s okay.

When it comes to America’s gun fetish there’s too much blame to go around, but arguably the biggest gun-pusher trap house in Ohio is the Ohio Statehouse, as its dominating GOP leadership apparently wants an AR-15 slung over everyone’s shoulder.

The below picture was taken at a Columbus grocery store. True, grocery stores are targets for active shooters, but must we all be openly carrying so to put an end to active shooters?

"The title is somewhat self-explanatory. I'm a 21 year old student from Chicago, Illinois, and I'm considering working next summer in the fishing industry, either as a greenhorn or in a processing plant. Only problem? All I've got to go by are anecdotes. I know it's brutal, dirty, often dangerous work, but is what people say about the money that's there true? I've been interested in trying it for a while, and I'm thinking this year's going to be the one I do it. I don't have any experience with the fishing industry (being from Chicago and all), but I'm interested in learning, I'm not afraid of 16 hour days of hard work (spent a year in the construction industry before going to school), I can cook fairly well, I don't get seasick, and I'm a fast learner. Most of all though, I've got nothing to lose and nothing keeping me here. Spending a summer working in Alaska would help me pay for college and take some steps towards financial independence and making something of myself. 

Long story short, this year has not been too kind to me. I had a very serious long term relationship end, my relationship with my parents (whom I'm still financially dependent on) has been taking a turn for the worst, and my financial situation has changed to the point where if I have to take out loans I'm going to spend years paying for them on a teacher's salary. I'm sick of being financially dependent on my parents, terrified of going into debt, afraid I'll be 30 and still living at home, and sick of being almost 22 and having nothing to show for it, while my friends are all settling down and moving on with their lives. Having said that, I'm not going to sit around feeling sorry for myself, and trying to find work up here is my plan for improving my lot. I know there's no way to really prepare yourself for what you're getting into, but the ability to  (hopefully) make several thousand dollars over the course of a summer would literally be a life changing opportunity to me. 

What I'm really wondering is how to actually get my foot in the door as a greenhorn? I've heard working as a processor sucks but if it means getting some experience I'm willing to hold my nose and power through a few months. I've heard that you typically need to know someone in order to get a job on a boat. Should I start as a processor, try to find something online, or should I take a leap of faith and actually start hitting the pavement up in Alaska? 

Any insights would be much appreciated."|Alaska|2019|True|0
"So as the title says, I'm looking for help with a project of mine. I'm creating a sci-fi series with nations made up of various geographical regions across Earth. The one I'm working on now is called Vesperia, it was formed by the various nations of the Arctic Circle, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia.

To get to the point, I'm trying to name things within the Vesperian Confederation, cities, towns, schools, military and naval stations, starship fleets, exploration vessels and the like. I'm trying to name things after historical figures (explorers, scientists, war heroes, politicians and activists), as well as culturally significant places (heritage sites, natural landmarks like mountains and rivers, and places of legend from mythos).
I've done a lot of research but I figured I'd ask some people who are actually from Alaska, who are some well respected historical figures that I might want to name a city or university after, or some heritage sites I could pay homage to, and what are some well known natural or historical landmarks I could use to name things?"|Alaska|2019|False|0

"Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses. My team and I learned a lot about your situation and we hope any final product we develop can be used to assist you. Currently, we are beginning work on our version of a hydroponics system. If our project reaches maturity before the end of our time together as a team, we will reach out to a few specific locations. Unfortunately, considering the circumstances that this project is only one semester long, I don’t realistically see us reaching this point.


Hi everyone! I'm a student at Purdue University working on a project about food scarcity. I've heard from a number of sources that imported food in Alaska can sometimes be prohibitively expensive. My team is exploring the possibility of supplementing the availability of vegetables with hydroponics systems. For those who don't know, hydroponics systems are used to grow vegetables without soil in racks that can be stacked vertically to optimize space. They are efficient, low-budget, and can save money over time by reducing the need for buying or importing vegetables. 

So my question is, would you be interested in a small, low-cost hydroponics system in your home to supplement vegetables purchased at the store? Or a large hydroponics system for your town to increase the availability of vegetables in the community? Or is this a non-issue that doesn't need to be addressed?

I would really appreciate any and all responses. Thank you!"|Alaska|2022|False|0

Apparently, the ferry doesn't get its official summer schedule (starting May or thereabouts) until sometime in the next few weeks, though I am not sure if I misunderstood. I was planning to leave from Bellingham to Whittier, which seems quite pricey according to the example fare.

I drive a 2018 Honda Civic, and ideally, I'd like my car with me. I was leaning more toward taking the drive up instead, as it seems more cost-effective.

1. Where is the best place to live if I want to be close to nature, but is also generally affordable? Could you tell me a bit about the area you suggest too?

2. What is the most difficult part about living in RI? What are some things you hate about it? 

3. What do you love about living there? Why wouldn't you ever want to leave?  

4. I know I'm getting into the cosmetology industry, but my Husband currently works in marine construction. Sea walls and docks. What is the construction industry like in RI? What sort of jobs are available in RI? What industries can he look into for work?

5. Here in Florida I live in fear of the wild life (a water moccasin chased me in my parking lot not that long ago, I've had snakes fall from the sky onto my patio, i've had alligators in my back yard), I want to live close to nature.

(Please excuse me if I come off like a noob)

Looking for some advice on proper hiking footwear for myself and girlfriend. We recently got into hiking and are obsessed. We want to three-season day hike, primarily. We’ve been to Kearsarge, Monadnock, and plan to continue to explore the the many options and difficulties in New Hampshire, hopefully leading to 4ks and the best day hike trails the state offers.

We both have a pair of mid-hiking boots now, I don’t have any quarrels. They feel safe secure and breatheable, little heavy. My girlfriend has stated she has some pain/uncomfortable and they’re heavy. I forgot the brand off hand but they’re quality boots that many others had on the trails we’ve been on. I am wondering if she’d benefit from a a shoe or trail runner.

I just want some fellow NH hikers feedback on trail hikers vs hiking shoes vs hiking boots. We want to continue to progress and are interested in 2-6 hour day hikes and continue to escalate difficulties /distances/elevations.

>Osterholm says. ""I liken it to trying to plant your petunias in the middle of a Category 5 hurricane.""

What he was actually saying was 

>Testing, contact tracing and isolation are the tactics being used successfully to crush outbreaks in countries such as South Korea and Germany. But those places never had the level of case surges that many U.S. states are now experiencing.

>""When you have something like this happening, there's no way that traditional testing and tracing is going to have any meaningful impact,"" Osterholm says. 

> At this point, there are just too many new infections occurring too quickly for underfunded, understaffed public health departments to effectively use testing and contract tracing, according to Dr. Jeffrey Engel, the senior adviser for the COVID-19 response for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

Futhermore, the Rep from Johns Hopkins stated

>""Given our basic failure to fix the gaps in testing and the bottlenecks, that really puts us on a path where there is no viable alternative beyond shutdowns,"" says Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

>Now, Nuzzo doesn't think all hope is lost. If enough people finally start wearing masks, and get vigilant about staying at least 6 feet away from other people, especially indoors, there may still be hope in at least some places of avoiding new shutdowns, she says.

When asked what would work, Osterholm says

"Hey /r/Denver,

Travel nurse from California coming from \~12/1 to 3/1 for an assignment at Colorado Children's Hospital in Aurora.

Problem is I currently drive a Civic Type R, FWD, manual, basically no clearance, a wheel size incompatible with most/all winter tires etc. Thus, I'm looking to rent an AWD car for 1. everyone's safety and 2. make it up to the slopes without issue on my off-days. 

Just looking to get a community opinion on what my viable options are? Traditional rental car companies (Budget, Avis, Hertz etc.) and renting through Turo are essentially out of the question as it would be around $4k for the 3 mos.

Current ideas:  


* Ask someone on Turo to take it off-platform for a long-term rental (skip the middle-man, long term ""secured"" income)
* Ask someone selling a beater WRX, Outback on Craigslist to rent out to me for the 3 months.
* Buy a complete winter setup for my car (downsize to 18s, wrap them in winters) and just live close to the hospital and try to bum rides to the mountains on ski days.
* Ask someone here if they have a spare AWD car laying around?  


Mainly asking if these are realistic options and the culture of Denver-ites renting out to outsiders and if this is a common thing or what other solutions you all might have. TIA."|Denver|2020|False|0

"I have questions about the ice sculptures tomorrow night.
TLDR: Are there two different ice sculpture events, and where exactly should I plan to be to see them?

On the official [First Night website](https://www.firstnightboston.org/ice-sculptures/) it says ""Sculptures will be located in City Hall Plaza and available for public viewing from noon on December 31 to 12:30 AM on January 1."" 
But later it says ""Also, we’re excited to again be teamed up with Boston Harbor Now for their annual Ice Sculpture Stroll. Check out the below map to see where the sculptures will be set up."" And this map shows pins all over the city from Roxbury to Beachmont. 
I'm just very confused because are the sculptures going to be in one location or all around the city? Or are both true and there are two separate events one being First Night and one being Ice Sculpture Stroll? Or is it that the sculptures go from the plaza and get moved to the ""stroll"" locations later on?

Well now I don't have a girl but that's okay as long as he has a girl I want the guy to be Caucasian no older than me but not young. Between 40 and 50 for both male and female male must be completely shaved and circumcised the size of his cock doesn't matter to me as long as it looks good and he's clean as I am. The female should also be shaved and enjoy watching me do this.  I would obviously prefer this to actually happen in person and hoping maybe it could but for now I will settle for doing it here I do not consider myself gay because I am not gay I do not want to have intercourse unless it's the right time I prefer this couple to indulge and what I indulge in and to feel comfortable and what's going on. I am very good at role play and obviously very good in person I'm here waiting so as soon as this couple is ready hit me up oh yeah by the way the mail should be fit I don't want some fat f*** the female I prefer to be a little bit on the chubby side but really doesn't matter as long as she shaves and is good at what she does and wants to be there to do it not because she has to but because she wants to|SouthCarolina|2024|False|0

"Memorial Day weekend my girlfriend and I are visiting my sister in North Carolina.  Tuesday am we are headed out and want to be at my friend’s house in folly beach by Wednesday night.  I’m an outdoorsman but haven’t explored much down south.  I was intrigued by both Congaree NP and woods bay state park.    My original thought was to either leave super early Tuesday, drive 3 hours, and do a canoe trip at Congaree Tuesday and then camp overnight,  or hit up something like woods bay Tuesday on the way to Congaree, camp and kayak Wednesday.

I was assuming it would make more sense to rent kayaks than haul them down there in my truck, but I’m open to both, as we also plan on doing some kayaking once we are in folly.  I would just want a reasonably clear idea on where to kayak as I’ve heard kayaking down south can be a bit more maze like than up north.  I’d need a shuttle at the very least.

feel free to tell me that any of this is a bad idea, or to steer me in a different direction. maybe skip woods bay and zip straight to Congaree and maximize our time there.  or perhaps skip both and do something entirely different.  Or do a short stop at Congaree and save kayaking for after we arrive at folly beach?

suggestions on what to do, where to camp, where to kayak, rent kayaks, etc. would be awesome!

thanks so much!"|SouthCarolina|2021|False|0

2. What is the likely outcome from all of this fighting, in your opinion?

"Hi there, I'm a new driver in Sydney (a full fledged driver back in my Southeast Asian home) and would like to seek more clarification on the way red light cameras work around here.

From the Red-light speed camera FAQs I got this:
""The red-light detection function of the cameras is connected to the traffic lights and is activated when a vehicle crosses the white stop line after the lights have turned red.""

So what if your vehicle was already halfway past the line at the intersection? Let's say while waiting for the opposite traffic to stop so you could make a turn you have already crossed the line halfway before the light turns red and your back tires cross the stop line just as the light turns red, does this count as an offence?

"Hi, I'm Alex Rozier, Mississippi Today's data and environment reporter. I've been covering the ongoing issues with Jackson, Mississippi's water system, which recently culminated in a citywide failure that left thousands of citizens with [little to no clean running water](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/08/29/jackson-water-system-fails-emergency/) amongst a boil water notice that is now no longer in effect.

In the wake of the city's water system failure, our newsroom brought all hands on deck to cover how the water crisis was and is impacting every beat that we cover. We answered some frequently asked questions [earlier this month](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/08/31/jackson-water-crisis-faq/), but now I'd love to hear what you all still need to know. I'll be answering your questions this Friday at noon!

Here's a little more about what's happened since the water system failure, its eventual return to function and the end of the boil water notice:

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, along with his chief financial officer, Fidelis Malembeka, pushed back against recent news stories questioning [how prepared the city leadership](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/14/town-hall-mayor-lumumba/) is to tackle the current crisis. Specifically, they defended against the idea that the [city lacks a plan](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/08/jackson-water-plan-mayor-state-solution/), or that it doesn’t truly know how much it would cost to fix the water system. 

And on Monday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan again met with Mayor Lumumba, this time alongside the U.S. Department of Justice, to plot the [next course of action](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/26/epa-feds-prepared-to-take-action-on-jackson-water/) over the city’s water system.

"After some suggesting from fellow redditors, I've decided to switch my plans from Lake Hamilton to Lake Ouachita.

I am interested in the state park, hiking, biking, swimming, canoeing and kayaking.

The goal of this trip is just to check out the place since I've never been before. I want to visit it before I invite my immediate family on the trip.

For this trip in particular, I plan on visiting for one day only and am aware that I can only do so much, so I've finalized that I want to go kayaking or canoeing (depending on which one I feel like this weekend) and hiking.

Here are some of the more specific questions I have regarding this trip:

* Are there any must-visit coves or secluded spots for kayaking or canoeing?
* For canoeing and kayaking, which rental service would you recommend?
   * Preface: I do not have my own paddles or a life jacket
* What are any good local places for food lunch and dinner?

Has anyone ever had to pay fines or fees in this state? I had a $250 misdemeanor fine from two years ago that has long been paid, but apparently there were $30 in late fee charges that no one ever made an attempt to collect or notify me about. Fast forward two years later - the district court of Searcy had been charging $10 a month for a late fee ON the late fee, totaling $240 in fees that they refused to remove! As far as I'm aware these fines would have continued to accumulate forever, or at least until they thought they had enough to issue a warrant for arrest. Of course, hiring a lawyer would cost more than the two years of fees, so it's basically pay the money or let us continue tightening your noose.

"Hey All,

Hoping I can gather some advice for an issue I’m having with my electric bill...the issue being that it’s absolutely fucking stupid high. 

Moved into a new apartment in Arvada June 30th. It’s a garden level unit in a condo complex, 1100 sq ft. 2bd2ba. It’s a bit older but seems to be decently insulated. Has Central air, and we have kept at a modest 72 ish all summer (although now we have taken to turning it off every time we leave). We’re pretty conservative with our electric use, turning off lights etc. we’re both busy people and are out of the house often. 

Got our electric for the first month, July. 230 freaking dollars. I’m absolutely floored. Our last apartment, of similar size but with 3 people and even higher AC usage, was never more than like $70 a month. Clearly something is VERY wrong here! Our total usage for the month was 1665 kWh. My parents, who have a 3000+ sq. Ft house, used 1000 kWh for the same time period! Insane. 

Just got our August usage. AGAIN $230! I call Xcel and they give me the “oh we have different rates for higher usage blah blah” I’m like yeah I can read a freaking electric bill that doesn’t explain why the usage is so high. They tell me the average for last 12 months for our unit is $80, as I expected. 

I look around our building to find the electric meter so I can monitor it myself. it’s nowhere to be found. I email the landlord and explain our problem, they don’t know either. I call the HOA and the ONE PERSON who knows where the meter is is on vacation. why is this so difficult???

I guess our only option would be to have Xcel come out and do some testing or whatever to figure out exactly what the fuck is going on here. Because there is no way in HELL we are using $200+ of electricity per month. 

Thanks for reading. Anyone have any advice here or been in a similar situation??"|Denver|2019|False|0

"Been busting my ass trying to get a job for close to a year now, but have also been focused on being a caregiver with my mom with cancer and suffering from strokes.  Been working on my CPA studies in the meantime, and have put myself in 60k of debt by doing so.  There is no laziness here.  I was supposed to work at Nestle in August, was ""hired in,"" but then let go immediately without ever setting foot in the door due to them hiring too many people for the project after waiting two months for my start date in October (waited August to October).  Been working with recruiting agencies in Aerotek, Aston Carter, Kelly Services, CFS, and Robert Half trying to get something going since.  Every week, basically every day.  I've put in about 500 applications on ZipRecruiter alone, counting right now.  This is ignoring Indeed, CareerBuilder, Handshake, etc.  I was supposed to work at Securitas two weeks ago in a Staff Accountant position before it was cancelled due to COVID.  I was supposed to work at Airborne in Akron as a Staff Accountant, with immediate need, through Kelly Services, last week.  Cancelled due to COVID.

I. Have. Tried. To. Work. Constantly.

I have put applications in for fields unrelated to accounting in the last few months.

What am I supposed to do?  I don't qualify for Unemployment due to not being employed, correct?  Is there something, anything here, to help?  I just talked to everyone AGAIN and no one has any available jobs whatsoever.  

I'm about to be homeless due to our landlord dying and them selling the house / them moving in in two days.  I can't get a job.  I can't find anywhere to rent due to this.  My mom is extremely high risk and it feels like everything I sacrificed and work towards since 2012, when my dad was killed and I went to college to give my mom a good life, is now pointless.  My degree is not helping whatsoever.  My immense debt to help my mom is now for nothing if she gets sick.  I can't use my CPA exam studies if I don't have a year of experience.  I cannot get income in any facet.  I am so lost, stressed, and panicking.  

Anyone have advice?"|Ohio|2020|True|1
I filed yesterday. I know some other people have had this issue, but it’s saying that my SSN does not match my surname (it definitely does). They’re asking for copies of my SS card and birth certificate, no problem, I have those. But has anyone had this issue resolved? I’m going to submit copies in a few minutes but I just don’t understand why it’s even saying that because they do absolutely match. The only thing I can think of is I didn’t put my middle name on the application because it wasn’t asterisked. Stupid, I know, I should have just put it down but thought it was optional.|Ohio|2020|False|0

2:03 PM: The Governor begins speaking

Reminder that businesses and customers are obligated to observe social distancing guidelines. Businesses must also ensure that the environment their employees work in is clean and healthy. 

Jobs Ohio is a great organization that helps with job creation in our state. We are planning for the upcoming bad economy in order to ensure that Ohioans will not be as badly affected by unemployment. Jobs Ohio is working in those hardest hit by bad economy in order to allow companies to remain open or begin operation. They are focusing on small businesses. 

Dr. Acton will be issuing an order today in order to track where ventilators are and how many we have. This will streamline the process to ensure we know how bad our shortage may or may not be. We are working to secure more ventilators along with that process. Devices that may also be used to treat sleep apnea should also be reported, including Cpap and Bpap machines. Ventilators owned for personal use need not be reported. 

Since March 12th, employees working for the state have been working from home whenever possible. I have ordered state agencies to continue that process until at least May 1st. I have also ordered them to look into moving even more into working from home.

The state has required that water utilities must continue serving customers, even without payment, for as long as this crisis is considered ongoing.

Battelle and Ohio State University have developed a new, rapid test system that will be capable of processing 200 tests every day. This number might increase to 1,000 as infrastructure improves.

New technology is being innovated and is coming online. This is only possible because we are slowing the spread of the virus. 

Mental health is very important during this time period. We will be having a brief explanation of things you can do to keep yourself healthy mentally during this time.

2:19 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_________________________________________________
2:20 PM: Lori Criss begins speaking 

We are working with the homeless in order to give them a place to call home during this period. 

We highly recommend that you keep to a new routine and keep everything rather scheduled.

Keep in contact with your friends, family, and neighbors, especially those who live alone will keep everyone healthier.

If you are facing trouble with keeping yourself stocked on food and other important items, we are working on fixing that issues and many places may be able to help you now.

Keep in contact with your primary care doctor and if you are experiencing addiction, feel free to look into resources for help.

If you are religious or spiritual, keep in contact with your leaders.

Taking time to listen to nature or being out in nature is important for mental health as well.

Make sure you keep a balance between work and and social time. 

The state has created volunteer opportunities for those who have time to help during this period. 

Set boundaries for yourself so that you can take care of your needs whenever you need to.

It is important to remember that school is a community for children. Make sure to create opportunities for your children to socialize with their peers while practicing social distancing. 

Monitor the media that your children are browsing and answer their questions and concerns honestly.

If you were recovering from or dealing with alcoholism or other addiction, make sure to keep in contact with your recovery support groups.

Reach out and support those living with mental illness.

Seek serenity to accept the things we cannot change. Courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 

2:32 PM: Lori Criss stops speaking

2:32 PM: Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

Right before I walked into this room, I spoke to the the entire technology sector relating to unemployment and I made sure they understood that there is a lot of frustration with the current system. I wanted to give them a sense of urgency. They told me they had already increased the system by 20X and I informed them that it was not enough. I am doing everything I can and they are doing everything they can as well. This is not something that can be fixed in moments. We are listening to those of you who are voicing your frustrations. Please do not focus those frustrations on those who are working in the unemployment system. They are doing as much as they can. They have processed more people in the past two weeks than they have over the past two years.

On insurance, employers who cannot pay their premiums have been given a grace period. COVID-19 is covered under insurance and all hospitals in Ohio should be covered equally by all health care insurance providers.

We are always on the phone with the leaders throughout the economic and health sphere, trying to get everything fixed where necessary.

2:41 PM: The Lieutenant Governor stops speaking
_______________________________________________
2:41 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

2,199 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 585 hospitalizations, 55 deaths, 29,191 total tested. 

429 health care workers have been confirmed to be infected with coronavirus. This is 20% of the total.

A recent study focusing on mitigation measures taken in Italy found that there is a major difference between the hardest hit region of Italy and the lesser affected regions. 

No one person or president is at fault. A quote from the article is, ""This virus is faster than any bureaucracy."" Despite this, I feel that Ohio has done the most we can to fight this virus. 

We are building a response to both the surge we are expecting and a community-based response to keep everyone involved in the process. 

I feel confident that we have made the right choices based on our models. Even models that disagree with ours agree that social distancing is essential to slowing down the spread of the virus. We have to be prepared for the storm. We are looking into the worst case and the best case but the most important part of this is keeping increasing supplies in our hospital in order to keep capacity as low as possible. This is the calm before the storm, we're minimizing our use of hospital beds and other supplies, while maximizing their production.

Every time you go out, be vigilant, and be safe. Follow social distancing rules and listen to guidelines given to you by businesses regarding social distancing.

2:53 PM: Amy Acton stops speaking 
______________________________________________________
2:53 PM: Question period begins

Have you received any response from the education community about extending the school closures? What about to families of those students?

Governor: When we began these orders we understood that people would become unemployed or be on the edge of financial trouble or worse. This is the type of response that was necessary and I understand that people are making sacrifices. I have not had any direct conversation from superintendents but we are continuing dialogue. 

I'd like to have everything go back to normal but I cannot do that yet without putting everyone at risk. This is a once in 100 years event.
___________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: Have you changed your mind on your views in terms of the prison system?

Governor: Our prison system has the best interests of both the prisoners and their workers. We have been reviewing if there are prisoners who did not commit violent crimes and are nearing the end of their sentence. There are things that we will never do but we are looking into making decisions on a case by case basis. We have an obligation to both the prisoners and staff in prisons but we also have an obligation to those out of prison.
___________________________________________________________
3:00 PM: How many tests can the state lab handle each day? What is limiting our testing ability?

Amy Acton: Testing is still limited in supply. Our lab can do 280 tests every day and this takes around eight hours. Cleveland Clinic, Ohio State University, and hospitals throughout the state are also working on this. We do not have enough test kits still. There is a new type of testing being worked on called point of care testing. We have a team working on getting that testing as quickly as possible. We are doing everything we can. 

We're working on expanding our investigation force that's looking into the infection spread through contact tracing. We're also looking into technological answers to that issue.

Governor: Hospitals, do not send your tests to places that may take five or more days to get through them. Send them to our Department of Health lab or a hospital with a quick turnaround time.
____________________________________________________________________
3:06 PM: What do you think of the use of homemade masks that seems to be spreading? Do you think Ohioans should begin doing that?

Amy Acton: The CDC is measuring the benefit of wearing masks. In Ohio, we are already recommending you expect that you are infected and so I wonder if it will be necessary for us. I won't rule out that it won't be useful. We have seen the mask-wearing in Asia that possibly helps prevent the spread of disease and we will continuing looking into that.
____________________________________________________________________________
3:09 PM: What has your experience acquiring ventilators been like?

Governor: The other states have about the same experience as us but we are looking into having our own businesses produce ventilators for us. We're taking every opportunity to increase our supply. 

Lieutenant Governor:  I wanted to mention that Battelle has sanitized 3,500 masks and is working on ramping up on that.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:11 PM: Question on pre-employment drug screening

Amy Acton: I did not even think about that issue and I will be reflecting on that in the coming days.

Governor: We do not know exactly what the private labs are doing. All we can do is tell hospitals to send their tests to places that have quick turnaround.
________________________________________________________________
3:13 PM: Could there be an increase in medical error? Are any steps being taken to help those who may deal with medical malpractice?

Amy Acton: This is uncharted territory but we are working on this issue. Safety guidelines are being followed from what I can see. This sort of situation does give an increased risk of issues but no one has brought any problems to me so far. 

Governor: I have not been informed of any concerns related to an increase in medical malpractice either.
____________________________________________________________________
3:15 PM: When can we expect details on plans to prepare for the surge? There are reports of health care workers being told to avoid speaking to the media in other states, are you doing this in Ohio?

Governor: We have a call with the mayors every weekend. We expect we will have an outline of the regions and how the buildup will proceed tomorrow. 

I have no knowledge of an issue like that in Ohio. If it would hurt a patient's treatment, I would ask they not. We have been as open and transparent as possible.
_____________________________________________________________________________
3:18 PM: Why is there a holdup on FEMA relief being approved by the president?

Governor: I think they're working on that issue and it's likely a bureaucratic problem.

Lieutenant Governor: We've been given no indication that it will not be approved.
_______________________________________________________________________
3:19 PM: What role will FEMA play in Ohio?

Governor: They're there to give us whatever help we need. We're already speaking to them about the issue. 
____________________________________________________________________________
3:20 PM: Is there potential for an extension of the stay at home order?

Lieutenant Governor: We have been in talks with businesses about that and there is a chance but that is the governor's decision. 
__________________________________________________________________________
3:21 PM: Do you think you will need to create another department due to how this crisis has been worked through?

Lieutenant Governor: We do not have an explicit answer to that question but our current team has done a great job. 

Governor: We need to build up public health nationwide. We need to ensure our medical supplies are produced in the country.
_____________________________________________________________________________
3:23 PM: How is the process of budget cuts going? When will the stay at home order be extended?

Governor: We are aiming for 20%. Some areas will be exempt. More information will come in the following days. 

I make no promises of an extension but the best science tells us we cannot let up just yet. 
________________________________________________________________________________
3:25 PM: Question period ends

My mom crashed to a light pole a few weeks ago, she was about to crash into another car but she avoided the crash by hitting the pole. It was the other person's fault for passing the stop sign and out of instinct my mom avoided hitting her. The other woman quickly left turning into a hit and run. There is witnesses at the scene and they were able to get the license plates of the car. It's from Texas and the police report came back, we got her address,name, and detailed report saying it was her fault from the police.

On Oct 25 in the morning it said it was out for delivery, so I stayed home from work *again* to receive it. Then at 11:07 am I watched a FedEx ground truck literally drive by my house. I refreshed the tracking information and saw that it was marked as delivered. What the heck? I immediately called FedEx (and checked around my neighborhood). They gave me a case ID number and said they'll ""start an investigation"". In the following six days I spoke to FedEx multiple times but they have no updates and said to contact the shipper to have it resent.

Then today my coworker told me she experienced the same exact issue. First it was ""scheduled for delivery"" but never came on Saturday and the status went into 'Pending' that night. Then today it went from 'Out for delivery' to marked as 'Delivered', but the people at the address there said nothing was ever delivered.

"We got an email letting us know that our landlord is increasing our rent by 100 dollars a month! We've lived at this place for 4 years and the rent has been increased by around the same amount every year. I'm wondering if it would be possible to negotiate with the landlord about maybe reducing the amount that our rent is being increased by. I understand that renting in Canberra is very difficult and it will be quite hard to move out and find a new place as vacancy is very low. But I just find it quite frustrating that our rent is going up every year by quite abit.  

Just wondering if anyone else has negotiated with their landlord about an increase in their rent and whether it is possible to do so? We've kept the place well and have never had issues with inspections etc."|canberra|2021|False|0

"Hi guys

I have created a website to help the CBR community create goals, stay accountable and make life a little bit more fun in these times.  


[https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/](https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/)  


I have just launched it and would really appreciate some support from this sub! If you could consider signing up, posting some goals and supporting others. Also keen on feedback and ideas of how I can spread the word.   


[Screenshot of the site](https://preview.redd.it/05q0elezndq71.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f03f4a77fffc66f7810d54f6cc54790dbb8d08c)

How does it work?  
(taken form this page- [https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/how\_it\_works.php](https://cbrlockdown.yourgoals.io/how_it_works.php))  


  

1.  You post a goal, between 7 and 90 days long, and the clock starts counting down
2.  Other users select the ""back you up"" button to show you support
3.  You upload pictures, links to videos or text updates to show your progress 
4.  When the goal timer is up, those users who backed you up, can vote on the evidence you posted to verify you hit your target
5.  Your goal is complete!
6.  You make another goal, back some other users up and continue
7.  You will earn badges as you go and knock-off that to-do list."|canberra|2021|False|0

I'm thinking of options like buying food and donating it to a food bank, or using it for our regular shopping and donating the money we would have spent, etc.  Or should I just cut up the card? 

We're not rich, but we make enough to feed our family and don't need the extra $300-ish. We've never had or used SNAP. My understanding is that while this p-ebt program is state-funded, the federal government is reimbursing states for all of it that is used, so I'd hate for it to go to waste.

"Has anyone ever been in trouble for title jumping in New Hampshire? What happened?

I bought a car for my cousin who was supposed to move here. He was a week away from making the move before he backed out. No biggie, I got it for a steal and will make more than what I paid for it back. I really don't want to deal with the town hall or DMV. On a personal note, they don't deserve a cut in this. I've spent more than a few hours fixing a couple issues. I'll record the income at the end of the year.

The title and bill of sale are signed by the previous owner - and it is their name thats on the title. They didn't ask me to fill it out on the spot since I was going to pass it along to a relative. 

&#x200B;

What if I pass it along to someone else and was upfront about the situation? 

&#x200B;

I'm worried it could fail inspection for rust, I'm doing my best to fix what I can and cover up the rest. There is no rot though. I've had cars with more rust pass and I've seen cars with less fail, its all about where you go.  Some people are ridiculous and could make a big thing out of it. Rather than fret over it I'd like to hear others personal experiences. It's worth mentioning that I have no criminal record and I'm 30.

"I'm strongly considering moving to Huonville. There's a multitude of reasons why I should. Both of my parents were born in the Huon/Esperance region - and as much as I was raised in the suburbs of Hobart, the Huon is the only place I've ever felt like I was home.  I've come out of a marriage of family violence and another 4 years worth of that again after separation, and I feel a permanent fresh start is what my family and myself need. 
Kingston isn't too far away if I need to go further afield for something. I feel this could definitely be the place for us.

I have two sons, one is in High School and one is in late primary school.

By searching I think I've found my answer for public transport, but I have other questions.
I was hoping someone might be able to answer them for me!

What are NDIS services like there? 

I have qualifications and experience in Horticulture - are there job opportunities? 

What are the local schools like? 

Are the medical services reliable there? We just need a doctor, and a psychologist. Oh, and a vet for the feline child.

From what I have been told, there's lots of community activities for the kids (eg PCYC, sport, Pool). Is this true, and also what is available for adults? 
For context I'm in my early 40's so I won't be missing the nightlife of Hobart at all 😂

Shopping seems great - and if I really need to go elsewhere Kingston is only up the road. But I wanted to know from a local perspective.

“FFI is committed to delivering green hydrogen projects in Australia and is making good progress across our portfolio. We are continuing to work with stakeholders, including the Tasmanian government, to secure power and water supply for our plans in Tasmania,”

The sizable farms tucked away in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, the deep woods and creeks, the sprinkling of German Mennonite church, the ""big"" small towns like Frederick, Westminster and Bel Air. The classy well kept small towns like Mt. Airy, Taneytown, Thurmont, and Hampstead. The numerous nature preserves areas such as Prettyboy Reservoir Park, Catocin Mountain Park/Preserve, Liberty Reservoir Park, and Rocks State Park. This assures that the area will remain semi rural. Also relatively low COL compared to other parts of the state. Overall I think Northern Maryland is hands down the most underrated region of Maryland. It deserves more attention then it gets. It has some of the best Piedmont scenery around, a unique culture, and some quaint small towns. I think more people should check out Northern Maryland.

Ok so years ago my mother had her friend do flooring in our modular house before she died, cause the carpet was bad... But the friend did not do a good job with it, left bubbles and air pockets plus the flooring was cheap soo it tore if we tried to move furniture and stuff. Now it has holes and showing the base floor of the house. This is a problem cause I want this fixed, but neither I or my grandma can pay for this, insurance won't cover modulars, and I am in a rut of who to go to for information I need to get this going. Grandma does want to move but it's like pulling teeth with her and I do not think we will move before winter. Another issue is I am on propane and have aid with that as well, Soo I feel I am wasting more propane trying to keep my house warm then I am using it in anything else. Like i said i been trying to debate to put this in two other subreddits but i am not how much help i would get for me being in ohio.

I am a student at Rutgers University working on a research study, and I would like to know if anyone is willing to complete this survey and share it with others. 

My research study is on improving infrastructure in coastal communities to alleviate the impacts caused by frequent flooding and other natural hazards. The purpose of this survey is to help me identify key areas of concern resulting from the effects of flooding and other natural hazards. The survey has ten questions, seven of which are multiple choice and three open responses. The survey is anonymous with no benefits or risks as it does not ask for your name or other personal information. Participation is completely voluntary, and refusal to participate will result in no penalties. You may opt out of completing the survey at any time while taking it. 

I am hoping to get as many people that either reside or work in Perth Amboy specifically, but if you live or work in another coastal city or town, you are welcome to fill out this survey. Should you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for your time!

"My girlfriend and I are looking at apartments and I found two complex’s one in Landing through a complex named Shore Hill Apartments with Platinum Realty management and the one in Kinnelon through Garden communities named Kinnelon Ridge. 


We were thinking of either one of these complex’s although I haven’t applied to either yet so I don’t even know if I get approved (I make at least 60k as a therapist but have no rental history as I’ve lived at home). Also the person I talked to for the complex in kinnelon did not seem the friendliest when I asked her questions. 

 I was curious if anyone had any thoughts on these towns? I know Kinnelon is a nice town especially to raise a family I guess my main concern is my girlfriend is Peruvian and based on the demographics both these towns are pretty white and republican which isn’t an issue but I guess I’m just concerned how comfortable we feel there. I’m from the West Essex area and although these towns are more white  we’re used to being near diverse towns with a lot of different cultures so I’m sure it be an adjustment in either one of these towns given the greater area. If not these towns does anyone have suggestions for other apartments or towns?

Hello, I was writing this post to see if anyone on this group was interested, or knew of someone who would be interested in a 24/7 caregiver job for an elderly friend we are trying to get some assistance for. The gentleman is 80 years old and resides alone, in an apartment. He would have a bedroom available for anyone interested, as well as food. So, food and shelter would be covered by him. Besides this, he is willing to pay 1850$ weekly. The primary job responsibilities would be: 
-driving him to and from doctor’s appointments. 
-Grocery shopping 
-cooking meals (relatively healthy meals as He is on dialysis, so has some dietary/fluid restrictions. this is important as he enjoys foods and as long as the individual interested can cook well, we can provide general recommendations of foods. 
-laundry/folding clothes/sheets (unit in apartment) 
-coordinating with medical team (if needed) to address needs/concerns 
-assistance getting to and from the bathroom, if he needs to go later in the night. Generally, he does not, but if he does wake up at night, he tends to feel weak and would need assistance. 

To clarify further, in terms of payment, he is willing to pay $1850 a week and this can be made out as a check or cash, whichever works for you. When you run errands/grocery shopping, he will provide a card to cover the costs. Moreover, he will also have a private room for you to stay in. If interested, you will have shelter and food covered, as well 1850$ weekly.

">> **Monash father accused of incest breaches bail conditions | The Canberra Times | Canberra, ACT**

>> *Hannah Neale*
>> *28 Jun 2024 at 4:00 PM*

>> A dad, accused of raping and indecently assaulting his children, “confronted” a witness and interfered with a police investigation, a prosecutor has claimed. The 44-year-old man from Monash, who cannot be named for legal reasons, faced the ACT Magistrates Court on Friday after breaching bail conditions.  He faces 40 charges including eight counts of incest or attempted incest, 19 counts of committing an act of indecency on a young person, as well as multiple counts of committing an act of indecency in the presence of a young person. It is unclear if he has entered pleas to the charges. A police document states the alleged crimes involved seven victims including the man’s children and their friends. On Friday, a prosecutor told court more complainants had come forward to police. The lawyer applied to have the man’s bail revoked, saying he had “confronted” a witness in breach of his conditions.  They said the 44-year-old had attempted to interfere with the police investigation by contacting the person.  Legal Aid duty lawyer Lesley Jayasuriya argued against bail being revoked.  Mr Jayasuriya said he had been instructed the man didn’t know the non-contact condition extended to this particular witness.  “[He] instructs that upon receiving that update he then blocked [the witness] from Facebook” the lawyer stated.  Magistrate James Lawton allowed the man’s bail to continue, but urged him “to carry your bail conditions around with you and further comply”. Police documents allege the man raped and indecently assaulted three of his children over a period of several years with the youngest being 10. He is also accused of urging some of them to do lines of cocaine. Three of the children reported waking up to find vibrators turned on near their pillow, allegedly placed there by their father. It is also alleged the man hid cameras in the girls’; bedrooms and around the home. The documents also allege the man raped his half-sister when she was 16. The man is accused of walking around the common areas of the home naked and making sexual comments to friends of his children. The documents allege on one occasion he was walking around naked except for a McDonald’s cup covering his genitals. When another friend stayed the night, the man is accused of placing his genitals on the boy’s head while he was sleeping and taking a photo. The man also allegedly Tasered a child on the arm after saying: “Let me Taser your nuts and you can have a few lines of coke.” He is set to return to court at a later date.

"Well everyone it happened. Walmart 21st and maize. I was walking to my car with my 1yr old behind this couple who weren't wearing masks in the store and was keeping atleast a 15ft gap between myself and them. They started itching closer and closer and we're talking very loudly as they wanted to be heard saying folks that wear masks should ""Rob banks with them"" that they also ""had there thumb up there ass"" and of course the ever so used ""sheeple"". Now I'm not one to engage in an argument or conflict unless it's directly at me. So they had parked near my car and the gentleman proceeded to call me a sheeple and dumbass. Me being a chill dude I ignored until he tried to come near me and my child. Which at this point I'm ready for whatever comes next. Well as he continues on his lil rant towards me I kindly asked if he had anything else better to do with his life. Well that upset this individual and his wife. Now keep in mind I don't judge people by any means. We are all humans with our own problems, life and whatever else. But as they proceeded to get into there early 2000s Pontiac on 2 donut wheels that was 4 different colors, I could see now why they were talking like that towards me. So any way homie starts getting loud with me and I'm minding my own still walking with my child in the stroller and he starts yelling. I proceed to call him a mouth breathing child and leave it at that. Any way big slice says to me ""if you got some shit to say come over and I'll break your fuc*ing neck"" so I just laugh at him which appeared to anger him and his companion even more. While touting whatever it was I just walked off. As I park a distance from everyone else trying to get spots close to the door. Needles to say why do people think that another person isent capable of doing whatever is necessary to protect there child and themselves. I'm honestly curious in these individuals thought process of this ""untouchable"" mindset when you know nothing about this person your trying to start something with. That being said I wish everyone well with hope and love to get through this crisis. Stay strong Wichita.

"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Controversy is heating up when it comes to a new law in Arkansas you have likely heard of.

Act 372 will allow library employees to face criminal penalties for distributing books found to be harmful to children.

Executive Director of Central Arkansas Library System, Nate Coulter, said one of the lawyers for the library came to the board Thursday to explain litigation options when it comes to this new law. The board voted to allow the attorney to keep exploring litigation.

“I call it an attack on the freedom to read in the first amendment,” Coulter said in an interview Friday.

Coulter said there are two components so far, his board and library attorneys believe are unconstitutional.

One is the harmful to minors, criminalization provision.

“The idea that vilifying librarians and subjecting them to criminal penalties for something that has already been determined in one instance to be a standard that is flawed, is hard to understand frankly,” Coulter said.

Coulter pointed to a federal case in 2004 where a similar statute was found unconstitutional.

“Even though they switched words here and there, the effect is the same,” he said.

The second component is the statute that allows a city board or county quorum court to decide if a book stays in the library or needs to be moved.

We reached out to State Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Jonesboro) who sponsored the bill that is now law. He said:

“The only confusion as to the constitutionality of Act 372 seems to be in Nate Coulter’s head, as fueled by the law firm salivating over the possibility of biting into the $50,000 that the Central Arkansas Library System budgets for lawyers. Coulter campaigned against the bill, and now that it is law, he has been looking to spend taxpayer money to overturn it–including falsely claiming it applies to materials the Attorney General himself made clear the law doesn’t cover. I wonder whether the citizens of central Arkansas, who pay amongst the highest library taxes in the state, know that the head of their library system treats their hard-earned money as a slush fund to pursue his personal progressive crusade.”

In response to the statement, Coulter said,

“When you cannot respond on the merits or the substance of what we are talking about, then I guess you resort to attack me personally,” Coulter said. “This is not about me. It is not about Dan Sullivan. It is about the law.”

Coulter added that the library is looking for pro bono representation. As of now, the law is set to go into effect August 1. Coulter said they expect a lawsuit to be filed before then."|arkansas|2023|False|0

"# Post your ""Moving to Montana"" (MtM) questions here.

A few *guidelines* to spurring productive conversations about MtM:

1. **Be Specific:** Asking ""what towns in Montana have good after-school daycare programs?"" will get you a lot farther than ""what town should I move to?""
2. **Do your homework:** If a question can be answered with a google search ... do the google search. Heck, try [searching previous threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/search/?q=Move%20to%20montana) here.
3. **Take the wins where you can:** Your question got downvoted, but also generated some informative responses. Often that's the best you can hope for around here. Take the **W** and feel good about it. Don't take personal offense to fake internet points or comments. But please do report abuse. We don't want abuse here.
4. **Seriously, don't ask us what town to move to:** Unless you're asking something specific and local-knowledge-based like, ""I have job offers in Ryegate and Forsyth, which one has the most active interpretive dance theater scene""?
5. **Be sensitive to Montanan's concerns:** Seriously, don't boast about how much cheaper land is here. It isn't cheap to people earning Montana wages. That kind of thing. 
6. **Leave the politics out of it:** If you're moving here to *get away* from something, you're just bringing that baggage along with you. You don't know Montana politics yet, and Reddit doesn't accurately reflect Montana politics anyway; so just leave that part out of it. No, we don't care that Gavin Abbot was going to take away your abortion gun. Leave those issues behind when asking Montanans questions. See r/Montana Rule #1
7. **If you insist on asking us where to move:** you are hereby *legally obliged* to move to whatever town gets the most upvotes. Enjoy Scobey.

**to** r/Montana **regulars**: if they're here rather than out there on the page, they're abiding by our rules. Let's rein in the abuse and give them some legitimate feedback.

"I know this has already been covered to some extent but I wanted to add another option to the table for returning control of the internet back to consumers. Arkansas is at a severe competitive disadvantage where quality internet access is concerned, with a sizable amount of our residents having few or no options for quality, affordable internet access. You either take the slow, expensive single option you have, or you go without. 

You can and should call your congressman and both of our senators, and remind them that they are supposed to work for us, not AT&T, Cox, Windstream, Verizon, etc. You’ll probably receive a canned response stating something along the lines of “It’s not currently a legislative issue” or “I oppose net neutrality” just like the responses I received. 

Then, Remember who your representatives really support next election. 

But, here is the next thing you should do: if you are one of the many Arkansans who receive power from a Cooperative, you are a member and therefore “owner/shareholder” of that Cooperative. Call your board members and tell them you want them to become ISP’s. Some of the cooperatives are already going down this path (Ouchita, Ozark’s, and North Arkansas) but many of them are hesitant because of the cost and concerns about the support of their customers. 

Fiber to the home throughout the state would be extremely advantageous for us economically and would help pave the way to place broadband back in the hands of consumers. 

Edit: I directed this post to the people in the state I call Home but I do think this message needs to go beyond us. There are over 900 member owned power utilities in the United States. All of them already have at least part of the infrastructure in place to make this happen. If members of those utilities pressured their boards and executives to invest in fiber to the premises and large scale data infrastructure and then financially supported those investments (by becoming subscribers), it could completely reshape the way broadband service works in this country.  If the fed refuses to break up the bell system (which is desperately needed, again) we can do it for them. "|arkansas|2017|False|0

"Another redditor recently posted about one of the ""coyote friends"" they saw.

I commented ""they eat our pets"", and that comment very quickly was down voted into oblivion. Someone else told me that if your pet gets eaten by a coyote, you musn't have taken very good care of your pet.

I wanted to make this post to bring a simple fact to your attention: the coyotes are naturally aggressive to small animals, and they have been getting increasingly brazen about targeting our loved ones. I would go as far as to say that small children are not safe at dusk.

Here is the story:

My aunt was walking her Chihuahua in the park, with people, small children, and dogs around. A coyote ran through the park, took her dog in its mouth, and ran off whilst ripping the leash out of her hand.

Some locals found half of him in the wash.

One week later on the day, she was having some family in the park to have a memorial service for her fallen friend. Interrupting her mid speech, a coyote tears through the park with a Pomeranian locked in its jaws.

We chased, threw sticks and rocks. My father caught up to it, kicked it in the rear leg, and it dropped the dog.

The dog had severe neck injuries and was bleeding out. It was taken to a hospital, where it made a partial recovery. We later found out that the Pomeranian was taken from someone's back yard, three blocks away.

I also have a small to mid sized dog, and I feel bad that she can't play in the back yard because it simply isn't safe. The coyotes do not care about people, and they do not care about walls or fences. These two instances are just the two that I have witnessed, several other neighbors have lost their pets as reported on the Nextdoor forums.

Beware the coyotes, and keep your pets in doors. Go out with them when needed, keep them under supervision.

Nobody did anything wrong, nobody was negligent. The coyote are varmints who eat our pets.

**EDIT:** the comments are right. Perhaps a better way to have said this is:

Coyotes are wild animals. Just because they look cute does not mean they are friendly. Don't let them eat your newborn, because they have a propensity."|phoenix|2022|False|0

"Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses. My team and I learned a lot about your situation and we hope any final product we develop can be used to assist you. Currently, we are beginning work on our version of a hydroponics system. If our project reaches maturity before the end of our time together as a team, we will reach out to a few specific locations. Unfortunately, considering the circumstances that this project is only one semester long, I don’t realistically see us reaching this point.


Hi everyone! I'm a student at Purdue University working on a project about food scarcity. I've heard from a number of sources that imported food in Alaska can sometimes be prohibitively expensive. My team is exploring the possibility of supplementing the availability of vegetables with hydroponics systems. For those who don't know, hydroponics systems are used to grow vegetables without soil in racks that can be stacked vertically to optimize space. They are efficient, low-budget, and can save money over time by reducing the need for buying or importing vegetables. 

So my question is, would you be interested in a small, low-cost hydroponics system in your home to supplement vegetables purchased at the store? Or a large hydroponics system for your town to increase the availability of vegetables in the community? Or is this a non-issue that doesn't need to be addressed?

"I recently got a job offer to work in Denali for a seasonal position. I've been exploring options to get up there (I would be coming from northern Nevada), either by ferry or by driving.

Apparently, the ferry doesn't get its official summer schedule (starting May or thereabouts) until sometime in the next few weeks, though I am not sure if I misunderstood. I was planning to leave from Bellingham to Whittier, which seems quite pricey according to the example fare.

I drive a 2018 Honda Civic, and ideally, I'd like my car with me. I was leaning more toward taking the drive up instead, as it seems more cost-effective.

"The title is somewhat self-explanatory. I'm a 21 year old student from Chicago, Illinois, and I'm considering working next summer in the fishing industry, either as a greenhorn or in a processing plant. Only problem? All I've got to go by are anecdotes. I know it's brutal, dirty, often dangerous work, but is what people say about the money that's there true? I've been interested in trying it for a while, and I'm thinking this year's going to be the one I do it. I don't have any experience with the fishing industry (being from Chicago and all), but I'm interested in learning, I'm not afraid of 16 hour days of hard work (spent a year in the construction industry before going to school), I can cook fairly well, I don't get seasick, and I'm a fast learner. Most of all though, I've got nothing to lose and nothing keeping me here. Spending a summer working in Alaska would help me pay for college and take some steps towards financial independence and making something of myself. 

Long story short, this year has not been too kind to me. I had a very serious long term relationship end, my relationship with my parents (whom I'm still financially dependent on) has been taking a turn for the worst, and my financial situation has changed to the point where if I have to take out loans I'm going to spend years paying for them on a teacher's salary. I'm sick of being financially dependent on my parents, terrified of going into debt, afraid I'll be 30 and still living at home, and sick of being almost 22 and having nothing to show for it, while my friends are all settling down and moving on with their lives. Having said that, I'm not going to sit around feeling sorry for myself, and trying to find work up here is my plan for improving my lot. I know there's no way to really prepare yourself for what you're getting into, but the ability to  (hopefully) make several thousand dollars over the course of a summer would literally be a life changing opportunity to me. 

What I'm really wondering is how to actually get my foot in the door as a greenhorn? I've heard working as a processor sucks but if it means getting some experience I'm willing to hold my nose and power through a few months. I've heard that you typically need to know someone in order to get a job on a boat. Should I start as a processor, try to find something online, or should I take a leap of faith and actually start hitting the pavement up in Alaska? 

Any insights would be much appreciated."|Alaska|2019|True|0
"So as the title says, I'm looking for help with a project of mine. I'm creating a sci-fi series with nations made up of various geographical regions across Earth. The one I'm working on now is called Vesperia, it was formed by the various nations of the Arctic Circle, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia.

Today around noon I was driving back to Cincinnati on 75 North. Just before the (shut down?) rest area the car in front of me started billowing smoke. I pulled over to make sure they were all good, no fire, etc.

"Trying to schedule an appointment for my child with a therapist at KU Med is a 2 month wait. Every other place I've tried is the same unless its an 'emergency', which is classified as self harm or thoughts of suicide. The problem is that sometimes its not one of those things but you can't wait 2 months. So you have to schedule it regularly once a month or more, whether they need it or not. But even that doesn't work with KU Med because its a 2 month wait but the therapists don't take appointments more than 3 months out. It's absolutely maddening. 

I was told by one of the dozens of therapists offices I called that the reason for this is a shortage of therapists. Why is that? Is the money not good? Training difficult? What else, anyone know?"|KansasCity|2023|False|0

"I will be visiting Vegas at the end of October with my wife and 3 kids (ages 12, 10, and 8). Back in college I used to go to Vegas at least 2-3 times per year, mostly for college tennis tournaments. The last time I was there was 4 years ago for a conference, and went with just my wife. We saw O and Love and really enjoyed both of them. 

My questions are 1) any other shows we should consider with kids that age?  I think we are leaning more towards Cirque de Soleil type shows rather than comedy or magic type shows. I wouldn’t mind seeing O again and I’m sure my kids would also like it, but for you veterans of Vegas shows, are there other better shows I should consider?

My second question is about the best way to purchase tickets. I know you can go online and buy them directly from the show’s website, but how often can you get discount tickets for those kind of shows?  The other slight complication is that my daughter will be playing in a soccer tournament, so some days the games may be scheduled earlier and we could see a show that night but we won’t know that until the day or two before, depending on how her team does. How likely am I to be able to get 5 tickets together the same day or day before the show?  The day we arrive should be the day before her tournament starts, so we’ll probably just buy tickets for a show that night in advance to make sure we get at least one show. 

Thanks for the help. I’m sure you tire of seeing here types of questions but I really appreciate it and don’t know anyone who lives there from whom I cold get advice. I also tried searching and couldn’t find answers to these questions. I did see the link to the 37 best shows for kids, but was hoping for some personal thoughts from people who have seen them and maybe have kids my kids’ ages."|LasVegas|2019|False|0

She says she moved somewhere in the Greenwood school district. Do I have to live in the Greenwood school district if I want joint custody?

"Hello... I am originally from Massachusetts and live in NJ now. I love studying fandom statistics.. its a hobby of mine.

But to the point, I was recently in Rhode Island and saw quite a few Yankees hats (Westerly). I did a little bit of research and I found out that because of the large Italian American population in Rhode Island, in the 1960s-1970s, the New York Yankees fandom grew to almost 40% of the state's population. Obviously since then, its definitely retreated by quite a bit. However, I would say that about 15% of Rhode Islanders are Yankees fans now.. per my observation. Significantly less in towns like Middleton and Newport, but higher in Johnston and Westerly. In Westerly it was like 25% of all hats were Yankees hats.

"Hello everyone! 

My husband and I are looking to move to Mississippi. His work is remote and my work isn’t location dependent. We were planning on going on an long road trip and staying in potential towns to get a feel for what they’re like and I was hoping someone would be able to help us out making our short list! We both love (and are from) the south and really love a slow pace of life! 

Our criteria for a town would be: 

- Not too small, but not too big. In our minds this would be around 15-30 thousand residents. It could be bigger or smaller, as long as the traffic was close to non existent and it had decent amenities.
- Decent amenities. My husband and I are in our early 30’s, we don’t go out to restaurants/bars/nightlife establishments of any sort and don’t mind if a town doesn’t have them. Our type of amenities would be a decent selection of grocery stores (so we wouldn’t be stuck paying a mark up at the one grocery store in town), gyms (ideally some more speciality gym activities such as yoga, Pilates, kickboxing, martial arts, etc.), nail salons, churches, a good home improvement store, a Walmart supercenter is convenient too just because they have so many things.
- A good hospital and decent everyday doctors (GP, dentist, common specialists, etc.) so that we wouldn’t have to drive to a city every time we needed to go to the doctor.
- Low crime. The safer the better! 
- Lots of nature and greenery/ green spaces and parks would be nice. Clean air.
- A nice downtown or Main Street area where amenities are closer together to avoid a lot of sprawl would be great. 
- Ideally located around 1-1.5 hours outside of a city. What city it’s outside of doesn’t matter, but just being at least an hours driving distance away is necessary.
- An affordable town. We’re moving because we’ve been priced out of comfortably living in our area and would really like to be able to be comfortable. Affordable cost of living and real estate would be important. 

That’s about it for criteria! If you’re able to help in sharing some towns thank you so much! Have a blessed day!"|Mississippi|2021|False|0

She then informed me that sparkling was only 2 syllables and I debated her on it for 2 moments of thought, then realised im just too southern for my own good, and continued to stand on sparkling as a better word through pure stubborn generarional principle.

"Hey guys, just moved here about a month or so ago. I love karaoke. Love it. I can sing decent and it's all I did when I was stationed in Japan (Air Force). Looking online I see quite a few dive bars and an all-around different experience than what I'm used to. 

Which is totally fine, and I can have fun anywhere.

That being said, does anyone have some first-hand experience with the local karaoke bars, or any recommendations for us to try our luck at tonight? We're mid-20's so maybe not looking for an old Texas bar where they only play country songs. Cheers!"|Omaha|2017|False|0
"I play D&D with a group and we meet up at a house near where Bohemian Cafe used to be.  I usually bring a 6pk of cheap tallboys and chips, but I wanna bring a little more this week.

"I recently moved to Omaha and needed to get my out of state vehicle inspected and registered in NE. Went through the typical experience that we've all had at DMVs, thoroughly unpleasant. 

My question is about the surcharges applied to customers who use credit or debit cards. I had to pay a $10 fee for the inspection, and a $2.95 surcharge was applied for using my debit card. Then I paid $135 for registration and a $7.95 surcharge was applied. This seems exorbitant, and from my experience in PA and NJ, unlawful. I looked into the NE code (http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=81-118.01), and it seems to indicate that businesses, particularly state agencies like the Douglas County Treasurer, can impose a surcharge or convenience fee, but it cannot ""exceed the surcharge or convenience fee imposed by the credit card or charge card companies or third-party merchant banks"", up to 4%. My credit and debit card company has a 2% fee. This would mean a $.20 and $2.70 fee respectively. 

Can anyone explain what's going on here?"|Omaha|2017|False|0
"It's tricky here (Gallatin Valley) with a short season and temperamental climate, but using biodegradable plastic mulch and starting seeds of shorter growing season varieties and transplanting makes it possible. This was one day of work, about 30-40 bins that were hand harvested. It took a total of 9 days.There were 6 miles of pumpkins/squash this year, all sold wholesale to local distributors within 30 miles. 

This year was about a 50/50 mix between different types of squash/wartys/colorful varieties and small (2 lb) to 40 or 50 lb orange and white pumpkins.

I had selected yellow, pink, striped, green, tan, tall/skinny, short/flat. It was so much fun picking varieties. The starting talley was 25k seeds. I think the total picked was around 17k lbs. 

This is the alfalfa/sweet corn. The pumpkin field was on the other side of the sweet corn. I didn't get as many pics as I would have liked, this was on my 'vacation' time from work and usually a dark to dark job for me, since there was a time crunch on my availability, plus getting crops in is always a big push.  

Not my ranch or crops, ranch belongs to my grandmother, my dad lives there and manages, and this will all go to my brother and his family at some point. I just help with harvests and wanted to share.

Over the years we have collected pallets from around town, and bins from grocery stores. The pallets are moved with a tractor/skid steer. They are stored in a large building until sold, then loaded onto a flatbed trailer and delivered."|Montana|2023|False|0

"The area I usually park at is taken by Netflix for some production for 24 hours during 12/1. So I was looking at other streets to park at in my neighborhood (Boston Chinatown). So street cleaning is supposed to end 11/30 I think for daytime cleaning but the street I’m prospecting has a sign that says 2am-7am daily (Boston website has 12:01-7am daily). The city of Boston website states: “If you don’t see any months on a posted street sweeping sign, parking restrictions are in place year-round.” But the sign on the street doesn’t have any months, so safe to assume it’s year round nighttime street cleaning for these streets?

Any help is appreciated to clarify as I am quite puzzled.

A friend of mine and I have been meeting another friend from Greenville once a month in Anderson to eat dinner. We’ve been to a lot of different restaurants and we’re having trouble deciding on where to go next. Raines on Main looks good but the website seems to indicate the tables are huge (so would be eating with strangers) and Earle St Kitchen and Bar is in the running but not sure if the area is safe. Can any Andersonians or others that have eaten at either of these two places please share your thoughts? |SouthCarolina|2024|False|0
Staying at a SC resort, fairly nice resort overall  really but in our room we found what I guess is a palmetto bug, which is basically a cockroach from what I've googled. Back in Indiana, cockroaches are cause for general concern and indicates you need some pest control/finding the source fairly soon. But resort didnt seem concerned, they said its fairly normal in SC to have them. So I guess for SC residents, is the resort downplaying it or is this just a fairly normal thing that you live with?

Hey y’all. Last night I was coming home from work and a cop chilling in my neighborhood and pulled me over for “running a stop sign” that I absolutely stopped at. I live off Fairview and he said they’d be having issues with people speeding through the neighborhood which makes sense I guess but the ticket he gave me was for 230 dollars!? He also made a big deal out of not putting the points on my license. Felt really bizarre. Anybody have advice or insight? |SouthCarolina|2024|False|0

"My husband has a salaried position. He already consistently works at least 50 hours a week Monday- Friday. Work got extra busy so they TOLD him that they needed him to work Saturday too. Then when he asked what the pay situation is, they said they will pay him by the hour but $10 less per hour than he would make during the week because “it shouldn’t be as busy on Saturday as it is during the week.” And it was *expected* that he would work Saturday. And it was busy on Saturday on top of it all.

Hi! In need to replace two HVAC units on my primary residence, and am confused if 14 seer is suffice, or it’s really worth upgrading to 15 Seer. Furthermore, some of the companies have reccomended 2-stage instead of single stage. And a couple companies sell the high end Bosch “fully variable” HVAC.  Anyone have this? Every salesperson that comes out has a completely different opinion. One guy said 14 seer is better for a rental (which this isn’t), but not for your primary residence. Not sure who to trust.

"Hi everyone, 

I’ve just been offered a job in Tassie on the NW Coast, I’m super excited but have one small dilemma, my cat. I’m currently living in Outback QLD and I’m trying to think of the best way to bring her down. She is quite an anxious girl so wanting to make sure I’m choosing the least stressful way for her. Here are the options I’ve come up with so far,

1) drive her to Brisbane, she’ll have to stay in boarding for a few days and then fly down to either Launceston or Devonport. 

2) Drive her down with me to Melbourne and use pawmobile to fly her over but she will probably have to board overnight while I catch the spirit over with my car. 

She hasn’t spent much time in the car so not sure how that will go. 

I’ve heard really bad things about pets going over on spirit of Tasmania so I’m a bit reluctant to do that. 

Has anyone moved their pets over recently and have a different option for me, or any advice in general. 

Much appreciated! "|tasmania|2024|False|0

x-posted /r/OKC

See my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/okc/comments/3k4q49/oklahoma_city_we_desperately_need_your_help/)

Last September, while my sister and I were stopped at a Conoco station in Oklahoma City, my sister's severe macaw Amelia escaped from her carrier and flew out of our car. We posted here and several kind redditors went to look for her but she was not found.

She has been looking for Amelia ever since: posting on craigslist, watching ads, bird forums, everything she can think of. All vets, pet stores, etc. in the area have received flyers with a photo of Amelia. 

Last night there was an ad posted on craigslist. The poster was from McAlester, OK and is offering to sell a severe macaw. Before my sister could contact the poster, the ad was taken down. The bird shown in the photo bears a striking resemblance to Amelia. All birds who are bred in captivity must wear a band around their leg with a unique identifying number. 

I know this is a long shot, but if you posted that craigslist ad, we would like very much to compare band numbers. We won't ask any questions and we will pay a reward for Amelia if it is her and she is returned to us. If you know anyone who is trying to sell a severe macaw (she is green with red and blue on her wings and white around her eyes with brownish feathers on her forehead and underneath her beak) that they haven't had for very long, will you please encourage them to PM me? 

Thank you to everyone who saw our original post and went to look for her. I know McAlester is quite a ways from OKC, but I have seen amazing things happen due to the power of reddit and I am hoping that someone who sees this can help make a miracle happen here.

Thank you. "|Oklahoma|2016|False|0

"This is a heads-up post, I am working with MeterUp to solve my particular issue.

I parked in the PPA lot at 8th and Chestnut yesterday, the signs and the kiosk digital display listed $15/day flat rate for weekend parking.  The machine couldn't read my credit card, so I paid with MeterUp.  The charge for the same parking lot and the same ""flat rate"" on the app was $20.40.  

I called MeterUp and asked them if there should be a difference in pricing on the app vs the credit card kiosk, and they said no, but that the city sets the app prices.  

What this comes down to, is that the city charged an extra $5.40 for using the app (error or ?).  If you have to drive and park in a metered spot and use MeterUp, just make sure you are paying the same price the kiosk would charge you for cash or card."|Philadelphia|2023|False|0

"Hi! I’m not sure if this is the right place to post and apologies if not but I’m not sure if the laws would differ in countries. 

I have recently had a role change at my job and a new contract issued. I’m remaining a full time employee and the only change is that I’ll be doing a 9 day fortnight and having 1 day a week off every fortnight but making up for that day off by working more hours during the week.

My old contract stated I was to work “a minimum of 38 hours with additional hours where required to meet the demands of the job”

In this new contract the 38 hours has been changed to 40 and even though I work longer hours than I already should, I’m more curious as to why they would even change it to 38 and if there’s a valid reason or if it’s just my bosses being wankers.

My housemate has also said she believes legally they can’t write more than 38 on a full time employee contract. Can anyone help me out with any advice on this?

"Hi r/Brisbane,

I'm in desperate need of a cuddle companion, and have a cat sized hole in my life. 

My problem is that despite adoring the cat I had growing up, I was very much allergic so now I'm looking into the hypoallergenic-ish cats (no cat is truly hypoallergenic). This brought me to the breed Russian Blue or just Russian [(apparently they come in white and black as well).](http://russiancatcouncilofaustraliaincorporated.com/gallery.html)

 I'm wanting to meet a Russian cat though before contacting a breeder because I don't want to waste anyone's time. Also [this site](http://russiancatcouncilofaustraliaincorporated.com/gallery.html) listed only one breeder in QLD, so I'd probably road trip down to NSW should a breeder have a kitten available.

My problem is that I have no idea how to find someone who might have this breed of cat to then ask them if they'd be willing to let me meet their cat. My next great idea is putting up flyers in a vet waiting room, ""please let me meet your cat;"" I'm not sure if that's a terrible idea. 


If anyone has any advice whatsoever, on hypoallergenic-ish cats, meeting a cat or anything I haven't thought of, I'd very much appreciate it.

"Hoping there are some opinions here, or someone who has experienced similar.

Just finished up at a rental place, during the rental period one copy of a front door key got bent (which I then threw out). 

The rental agency are saying since I can't return the exact same keys as I was provided, the lock has to be replaced and charged to me.

I feel like I should be charged to replace the key, but not the lock. The argument that since I can't prove the key was broken and disposed of is irrelevant - any renter could theoretically makes 100s of copies of the house keys and hold onto them. Either they have to replace all the locks after any renter leaves, or it's just assumed the renter hasn't done this.

"I am hoping someone here can give me some advice. I am nearing the end of the recruitment process for a couple of APS positions, both requiring security clearance, NV1 or NV2.

I am concerned about criminal associates. My sister’s boyfriend has just gotten out of jail on bail. His case is fairly serious and I have suspicions he is connected to organized crime, mostly because my sister has sort of been on the periphery of that for years and I am sure she is a “known associate”. She has also worked in the sex industry, not as a sex worker, but as a manager for many years. She’s had substance abuse problems and had a couple of DUI’s, but nothing else. She’s been to rehab and has been clean for a while and has just gotten out of the industry she’s been in.

She and I are very, very different. I went to law school, honours and academic excellence scholarships, and have always been on the straight and narrow. I tried weed and ecstasy as a teen, but nothing since. I barely even drink. I don’t associate with “criminals”, except through working in criminal law.

My sister and I aren’t especially close. We don’t share intimate details of our lives with each other. I lived very far from her for the last 8 years and consequently only saw her a couple of times. Now I live closer and see her about once a month. 

She wants me to meet her boyfriend. I am not sure whether to meet him while I am going through this process.

"Quick explanation: when I was a teen I always wanted to do the crafts and classes (woodworking, sewing, painting, etc) at my school and camps but my parents wouldn’t let me. Now as an adult I have the money to do it myself! Unfortunately, there’s zero opportunities once you’re an adult.

What I was looking for was some sort of program where you learn and experience different crafts and activities as an adult. It does not have to be specifically in the summer or at a camp, but just a similar experience where you can try new things through a program. Is there anything like that in the Indianapolis area, or even in the surrounded cities (Carmel, Greenwood, etc)?"|Indianapolis|2023|False|0

"Hey all, 

Those of you who've seen me around before know that I'm a real estate agent, and today I'm here to share some knowledge. I believe everybody can benefit from education on our local housing market. I'll be sharing some key numbers from the past 30 days, the previous 30-60 days (one month ago), and the same time period last year (395-365 days ago). Then, I'll share my interpretations of the information, and any other relevant trends that I am seeing personally. 

The last time I posted this, I said that I would post this data monthly. However, because our board of realtors released a ~~completely broken~~ multiple listing service with reduced functionality at the new year, this will be posted on an ""as I have time for it"" basis. What used to take me 30 minutes now takes me 3 hours at least. 

I'm going to share the median and average sales prices, the median and average days on market (DOM), the number of new listings, and the total number of sales. Basically, how much there is for sale, how fast it's selling, and how much it's selling for. I've also included months of supply in the first month, which is a general indicator of market balance. Six months is generally called a balanced market, while low supply favors sellers and high supply favors buyers. 

How I got these numbers: 

This data is intended to represent the area that I would call ""the greater Indy area."" This is anything about 16.5 miles from the north split downtown (to include Indy and the first set of cities outside of 465), plus Noblesville, Westfield, and Whitestown. While it isn't a perfect picture, I think it does a solid job of capturing Indy's housing market. The data comes straight from the multiple listing service (the MLS). I can provide the raw data for anybody who is interested. These numbers will probably be different from the numbers you see posted on social media. Those numbers frequently include as far south as Trafalgar and as far north as Marion (which I hardly consider greater Indy). This is focused on Indianapolis and the edges of the donut counties. 

**This Month's Data**

* Average Sale Price: $313k
* Median Sale Price: $275k
* Average DOM: 52
* Median DOM: 32
* New listings: 1,531
* Number of sales: 1,273
* Supply of homes: 32 days

**Last Month's Data**

* Average Sale Price: $307k
* Median Sale Price: $271k
* Average DOM: 45
* Median DOM: 26
* New listings: 1,299
* Number of sales: 928

**This Month Last Year's Data**

* Average Price: $299k
* Median Price: $260k
* Average DOM: 23
* Median DOM: 5
* New listings: 1,696
* Number of sales: 1,576

**My Interpretation**

You've probably heard that the housing market has slowed down from the height of the craziness that was late 2019 through summer of 2022, and you've heard correctly. 

For the first time since 2018, we experienced a true seasonal slowdown over the winter months. The growth in number of new listings (up 18%) and number of sales (up 37%) from last month to this month reflects that. Homes that sat on the market over the winter have finally started to sell as people come out of the funk that is the holidays. One month later – the ""typical"" length of time it takes to go from an accepted offer on a home to closing on the home – we see that behavior reflected in the data. 

Supply of homes is still low, according to the data. However, there's an important caveat here. Supply of homes is based on the following calculation: `(Number of active listings)/(Number of sales in the past year/365)`

Essentially, this gives us the number of days that it will take for all homes active on the market to be sold. This typically works, but given the shift we've seen in the market, I don't believe this is accurate. Since this data includes pre-slowdown sales rates, I think the true value is closer to three or four months, with six months being the accepted value for a perfectly balanced market. 

We can see that home prices are still up from this time last year, though the time of multiple offers and one weekend to see homes is gone. We're entering a balanced market, which is good for both buyers and sellers. 

The [current interest rate](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms) on 30 year fixed-rate mortgages is 6.5%, which historically is in the realm of ""not ideal, but also not that bad."" [Historical overall average since 1972](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/docs/historicalweeklydata.xls), when Freddie Mac started tracking it, is 7.69%. The highest it got (October of last year) was 7.4%. High rates are going to keep some buyers locked out of the housing market, which reflects the general trend of ""slowdown"" – a low number of buyers and a low number of homes for sale. 

**What this means for buyers and sellers:**

As I alluded to above, we're entering a truly balanced market. Depending on what the Fed does with interest rates (and predicting that is way above my pay grade), we could see shifts in either direction. Higher interest rates will keep things slow for a while, while lower interest rates will drive some interest and get some buyers back into the market. If interest rates get down to around 6% by May, I expect a busy summer in the real estate market. Otherwise, things will probably stay where they are. 

If you're a buyer who can afford a mortgage – and you never truly know what you can afford if you don't talk to someone – it's a good time to enter the market. You can get important repairs paid for, and you have room to negotiate. Obviously this varies from neighborhood to neighborhood and house to house, but this is the general trend. 

This is the kind of market where the maxim ""love the house, live with the mortgage"" applies. If you can handle the down payment and monthly payments for a few years before refinancing when the time is right, it's not a bad idea to make your big housing move. 

From the perspective of a potential seller, it's also not a bad time if you need to move. Homes in good condition are getting solid offers at or near full price, and that money will easily help you buy your next home. Sale contingencies are getting accepted (""I have to sell my house before I buy this one""), and waived inspections are a thing of the past. 

Let me know what you think in the comments! I'm more than happy to answer any questions, and let me know what you think about my interpretations of the market. I am just one agent offering his interpretation of the data. Other people could see the same data and offer different perspectives."|Indianapolis|2023|False|0

I went in line to get beers( at the booth setup inside the Iroquois amphitheatre) just before heading into Jack o lantern spectacular at Iroquois park and you and your friends were were just ahead of me.  Eventually, you turned around and asked me what kind of beer I was getting (2 Coors because one of my friends asked for a coors and I'm not very creative) and you said you didn't know what you were gonna order yet but that IPA stood for ""I'm a Pussy Ass"".   Your way with words and friendliness made the time waiting in line feel like nothing and it was super refreshing.

I was wearing a blue long sleeve and khaki pants with light brown hair and you were blond wearing blue jeans and maybe flannel ( I wanna say you were in like a 90s Nirvana-type look)  I had mentioned that I live out by the zoo which was a coincidence since the couple you came with ( the brunette and the guy with the long dark hair) actually have a house in that same area of town!  You said you were from the south side of Louisville but  it's all Greek to me since I got lost trying to park at Iroquois so what do I know... 

You guys got your drinks and stood off the side for minute and I was up to order so I thought maybe that was the last of the conversation but before I could finish ordering you tapped me on the shoulder and told me to have a fun time checking out the pumpkins and I asked you what your name was.  You said your name was Erica.  And that, of course, is where I could have and probably should have asked to swap numbers but I foolishly didn't and it's been bothering me ever since.

"Hey everyone!

I'm a experienced international traveler and I'll be doing a East Coast roadtrip and leaving Wichita on the 28th! 

Details:

Heading East I'll be planning on stopping at: Kansas City, Columbia, St Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, NYC, New Haven, Hartford, Providence, Boston, Manchester, Vermont, Montreal, & Syracuse.

Then on the return West stopping at: Washington DC, Richmond, Louisville, Nashville, Memphis, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, and finally Los Angeles!

I'm planning on this being a 14ish day long trip depending on how everything is going and how much we like certain cities. On the way out to the East Coast I plan on driving only 7-10hrs a day, so a casual pace to enjoy the trip.

Some cities listed above will be short stop offs, others I plan on spending more time at (NYC, DC, Boston, etc) but I'm open to spending more time in certain places.

Sleep in a hotel/airbnb/hostel, if you want to camp I'm down, I really enjoy the outdoors so definitely down for some scenic detours. I'm open with finances and don't mind eating out every night trying out the local restaurants, if you want to save money and eat by other means or make your own food that's cool. If money is an issue for you: gas & campsites/hotel costs can be negotiated. I'm very open to detours or even going further into Canada.

"I am currently in the Brightwood area near 25th and Sherman and have always wanted to help at a shelter but never really knew how to start but never really went beyond the thought either.  Having struggled with addiction and homelessness before and having just recently lost my girlfriend of 3 years to an overdose has made me really want to help those in need.  She never really had a lot herself having struggled with addiction and homelessness(both before me and with me) for a big portion of her life but always found a way to help those who asked, even if she only had a dollar, she would give it no questions asked and only wanted to make others laugh and smile, even though she was hurting inside.

I feel like a good way to honor her would be to help those who are in a bad spot by volunteering.  I do have a day job but would be open to volunteering on weekends or after work if I can.  Plus, anything to keep my mind occupied to help with the pain and guilt I feel from my loss would help.  

If anyone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you."|Indianapolis|2022|False|0

"Here's how to register to vote in Kansas. These instructions work nationally so they can be shared with out of state friends or family and use non-partisan information.

Please share the info with anyone who might want to register, but hasn't had the chance, time, or info to do so yet.

**Basically: Find your state **[**here**](https://vote.gov/)** and use your state's online voter registration tool to register.** If your state is one of ten that does not currently allow online registration, this website will tell you and will tell you how to complete your registration - it's usually printing/filling out a form and mailing it in.

OR, you can [register to vote in person](https://www.usa.gov/election-office).

**FAQ:**

**Q: Am I already registered to vote? Am I eligible to vote? Do I need an ID to vote? When is my next election?**

Answers [here.](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/sviddomestic.htm)

**Q: If I'm 17, can I register to vote today?**

Yes, in a number of states! If you proceed through to your state's online voting portal, which can be found [here](https://vote.gov/), it'll tell you whether you're good to go.

**Q: I'll be moving to college soon. Where should I register to vote?**

Either place - your choice. If you register to vote at school, you'll need to register or re-register with the state your school's in. If you decide to keep your home address as your voting address, you can head home to vote or vote by absentee ballot (info below on how to request & return one).

**Q: What if I need to change my voter registration?**

Find your state [here](https://vote.gov/) and follow the instructions. If you have any further questions call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm).

**Q: Can I register to vote on election day?**

If your state is purple on [this map](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx), yes. So, your friend who forgot to register can still come with you and get it done.

**Q: What if my state doesn't have same-day registration?**

Then your state likely has a registration deadline of about 30 days. That means it has to be **in their hands** by 30 days before election day.

If you're not registering online, I'd walk it to their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them, or mail it if you're doing it very early so you can be sure it arrived.

But don't depend on the mail within ...6 weeks before an election. It's just too dicey.

**Q: Do I need to keep that voter registration card they'll mail me?**

It's useful for your reference & knowing your polling place, but it is not *required* for voting. 

**Q: Can I use a pen with pink/green/orange etc. ink on these forms/on my ballot?**

It's the kind of thing you don't think of, until you do. They only allow the most conservative of colors and inks, so keep it simple: blue or black ball point pen.

If you're entering most of the info on the computer and then printing it out, your printer's default black ink is also fine.

**Q: Can I get an absentee ballot?**

*Make sure you're registered to vote first.* Then, [this page](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/VoterInformation.htm) will tell you your state's requirements, and how to request an absentee ballot.

If you vote absentee, unless you're mailing it in *very early* (over six weeks before the election), drop it off at their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them so you can be sure it arrived.

You can do that any day before the election.

**Q: If I have a felony on my record, can I vote?**

Check [here](https://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote)! Often, yes.

**Q: I'm forgetful. Is there a way I can be sent reminders?**

Yes! [Here](https://iamavoter.com).

**Q: But, do the midterms matter in my state? My state's firmly Dem/Rep.**

They sure do. While your state may not be competitive in a presidential election, your *district* may be competitive for the House of Representatives and your Senator may be. Plus, governor, state reps, etc. 

There are purple spots in blue and red states - you may be in one, and your vote could swing a number of outcomes.

**Q: Where's competitive this year?**

There are particularly competitive races in more than half the states - either [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings), [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings), or [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings). 

The list: New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Texas, Virginia, Washington, California, Colorado, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Jersey, Maryland, Indiana, and Rhode Island.

If you live in any of these states, there's a lot of competition for your vote this year and it's a great chance to get your voice heard.

**Q: If my state isn't on the list, there's no point in voting, right?**

Incorrect! Local races are hugely important. Some examples: county prosecutors can, for instance, choose whether to prosecute non-violent drug crimes or sex work that is occurring without trafficking. 

They also recommend sentencing. Some are very strict, while some others choose to make those issues their lowest policy priority. 

State legislatures and governors decide, for instance, what happens with guns, lgbtq+ rights, and school funding in your state. 

State Attorneys General can defend state abortion laws or choose not to. 

Secretaries of State can help people register to vote or make it harder for them, within the already existing laws. 

--

**tl;dr - register to vote. for a lot of reasons. if you read the news, or reddit, i'm sure you can easily come up with some.**

if you have questions about registering in your particular state, comment and i'll do my best to help. i did election stuff as a job for a few years, and i know how complicated finding the information you need can be. that's why i'm making these guides now."|Wichita|2022|False|0

"I go to Singing River Dentistry in Madison. The care I get at the clinic is great but they go a bit crazy on all their outreach texts and calls. For example, I had an appointment on Monday. I have received texts every day asking for a review and expressing disappointment that I haven't left one yet.  I had another appointment 2 weeks ago, which I did review. So every appt comes with a barrage of review texts. 

I could possibly unsubscribe but they're very picky about getting responses.

Last year, I had a chipped tooth and they were able to book a next-day appointment. They sent me a confirmation text, which I responded to. Later in the day, they called me to confirm again but I missed it. When I went in the next morning, they had canceled the appointment since I didn't answer the phone. Even though it was booked and confirmed on the same day. I understand wanting confirmations due to the amount of no shows, but this seems excessive. 

Are all local dentists like this? Again the care I receive is great, it's just a weird experience having a dentist office that acts like a jealous girlfriend when they don't get enough attention"|HuntsvilleAlabama|2024|False|0

"Every once in awhile I think about this and today is the day I’ve decided to post about it. 

I think car flip posts are in bad taste. People get injured in these types of accidents, sometimes fatally. Then to have onlookers snap photos of them (mayhaps from their own cars?? Which is dangerous if you’re driving. Also creates traffic due to rubbernecking) and then post them to an online forum? I think I would be furious if someone did this to me. 

Isn’t it time to retire these types of posts? Haven’t we had our fair share? Do we have to make light of someone’s terrible day? Or the possible loss of life? There are so many other “quirky” New Orleans things we could post about. 

The fact that it’s in the banner for the sub and that we have flair for it doesn’t sit well with me either.

This is something that I would need for 3 days a week. My ex wife and i have an alternating weekly schedule, example below.

Week 1:

 * Wednesday: Pick me up in merrimack any time between 2:30-3:30pm and drive me to Londonderry to get my kids and drop us off back in Merrimack. 

* Thursday pick me and me and my kids up in Merrimack between 7-8am to drive to Londonderry then drive me back home after. Repeat the process between 2:30-3:30

* Friday Same morning routine but no afternoon routine.

Week 2:

* Monday: pick me up in Merrimack between 2:30-3:30pm and drive me to get my kids and then drive me and them back to Merrimack.

* Tuesday: same as the Thursday schedule listed above

* Wednesday: same as Friday schedule above.

This would be something i'd need for the next 3 months. Uber and Lyft rates for this route are about $30 each way so obviously i'd be willing to pay more than that. I will provide the carseats. Commute is abut 30-35 min each way.

"Happy (or sad) Monday guys!

Welcome to our new weekly meta post. Mindless Monday is generally for those things that do not deserve their own submission. That being said, this thread is free-for-all, and you can discuss politics, your life events, Whataburger, or whatever here. Just remember to not violate Rule 1, or we human mods will feed you to the bear. Like this idea and want to chat more? [Join us on IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/texas).

There are many things I can't replicate (wide open spaces, the feeling of walking into A/C when it's 100 outside, giant styrofoam cups with crushed ice and Dr. Pepper, that hot dry grass/dusty smell), but I've learned to cook food and play music that reminds me of home.

The thing with music though is that I can't remember the names of everything. There are songs that you hear a lot without taking notice of the name or the artist. I bet there are a lot of songs that people could suggest that would take me straight back, songs that I had heard but never would have remembered.

"#What is this new chat?

orangechat.io (OC) is an easy-to-use webchat, embedded directly in reddit.com.  It allows you to just click and connect with your reddit account and immediately start chatting with other people visiting your favorite subreddits.

There are two ways to use orangechat, the extension and the embedded version. 

Extension:  [CHROME](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/orangechatio/eikmifkdpckaoknomnbhoeoiiacopofh)  |  [FIREFOX](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/orangechatio/)

Using the extension is the easiest way to use orangechat.io - it will embed in the bottom right of your screen when you are browsing reddit and will display chat notifications.  However, we also have a stand-alone version available that can be used anywhere [HERE](https://app.orangechat.io/#/r/texas) - no download required!  

#What are some of the benefits? 
* No registration: just connect directly using your reddit account.  We never have access to your password, and you never need to provide an email address.
* Easy to use: no commands to remember and no prior knowledge required - we’re trying to keep it simple - no one should need a manual to join or moderate a chatroom.
* Connects with reddit.com: integrating with reddit lets us make some things very simple - for example, subreddit moderators are detected automatically, and can immediately begin managing the chatroom (including bans and invites).
* Private messages, private chatrooms: turn a private message into a private chatroom by inviting other friends to the conversation.  You can also rename your private chatrooms, making it easy to keep track of friends and teams… or just express yourself ;)
* IRC integration: Many subreddits already have existing IRC chatrooms, and we want to help you keep all of your subreddit chat in one place.  We’ve been working with [Snoonet](https://www.snoonet.org), which specifically serves the reddit community, and have set up a system that will let you link existing channels on Snoonet with OC channels.   Users comfortable with IRC can stay part of the conversation using any client of their choice, while others can connect through OC.  

#It connects to our existing chat!

You can either use the new chat, or you can connect using your client of choice to #texas on irc.snoonet.org, or you can use the [old browser link](http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/#texas).

"Sorry if this is a pretty stupid question 

Got a mate coming to brisbane soon for 7 days and we will be using public transport every day. 

He's a concession and not a child so it'd be much better to some how get concession fares rather than the full adult cost 

I've looked into the temporary go cards but they're like over $100 for like 3-5 days which is BEYOND ridiculous amounts of money 

Would I be able to go to a train station which sells go cards, and with my concession ID (I already own a concession go card), buy another one for my mate for the $10 fee 

I see this as a viable option but I'm questioning whether it's actually legal to have two concession cards under my name, and I don't want to have to face any hassles to do with it. I wouldn't be able to get my mate to come use his ID and get one, because we're using public transport as soon as he gets off the plane, and were gonna use busses which obviously you need a go card to board.

This story caught my attention on a random video. I was quite disheartened to see it occurred in Byram, Ms. 

As a MS resident, it is a shame the amount of child abuse, neglect, and endangerment rates we have in this state. 

Agencies are overwhelmed (DCFS) and understaffed. I’m not sure what the solution is, but firmly believe it starts within the community. It’s time to demand state funded resources be adequately staffed and funded, as well as have changes in policy to help the core issue of the problem. In my opinion, those issues are under/uneducated populations, poverty, declining community standards, lack of leadership. 

Citizens like the woman in the embedded clip in the article are plentiful in this state. It’s unfortunate that the dregs on society outnumber the good people here. 

Sorry for the negative Nancy post on a Sunday morning, but this story tugged at more than my heart strings. It’s not the typical “MS gang culture/violence/corruption/politics content I’ve gotten used to on this sub and in the media in general. 

I know there are answers to MS’s problems. But we really need to start in our own backyards and communities. If only there was support for efforts that would benefit the core issues I mentioned, things could take an upward turn in many facets of the state that have been failing lately."|Mississippi|2023|False|0

I'm planning on going to Vegas in early July, however I will be out of the country until July 4th. The problem is my 21th birthday is during the international trip so I will only be able to go to the DMV for my new license once I get back and they give you a temporary paper but I don't think the real one will come in the mail on time for my Vegas trip.

Will this be a huge problem? I am planning on bringing the voided/expired ID in addition to the new paper temporary one. Should I bring my passport as well? Do bars and casinos even accept passports as a form of checking legal age? Because I know some places (where I live) have a scanner that scans IDs to make sure your ID is authentic but not a Passport scanner so they deny people who have a passport but no ID.

"Greetings r/losangeles,

I have the summer off from work and have been wanting to do a tour of all of the best/must go restaurants, food trucks, and general eateries across LA and Orange County!  

I went to school on the east coast and have friends who visit regularly , so  i'm always the person they reach out to for good recommendations. I've also developed a certain reputation among my family and friends for being the one to step out and try new and low key food spots in every area we visit. 

I find myself sometimes being very limited in places I'd like to try due to people not being interested in trying something completely different or they have never heard of. Hence what brings me to the idea for this journey of culinary exploration and enlightenment so I can not only share with with friends and family, but with the reddit community as well!  

I would love your suggestions of must try places in LA and Orange County to get the ball rolling. Your inspiration would be greatly appreciated and i'd share and update you guys regularly with my impressions of the people involved with the business , the food, and of course pictures and blurbs of anyone I speak to during my tour.

###Join us!

**Look forward to the Antelope Valley becoming alive with rando meet-ups.** Please, please, please come and let me know what ya'll are interested in doing. In the past, I've hosted a wee [NYE Party](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/44867072/), a couple [Halloween](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/29917851/) [Parties](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/213752052/), [Porn Star Karaoke](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/18524951/), [Industry Mixers](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/27922741/), Scary Movie Nights, [Photography Meet-ups](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/23178611/), [Movie Screenings](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/19115891/), [Museum Trips](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/18519901/), [Game Nights](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/40236882/), couple of kick-ass [GrMuDs](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/60836982/), and sweet baby jaysus... so. many. more...

Depending on how many people **[RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/240400234/)**, there's a small chance that we'll have to meet somewhere else. I'll let you know a couple days before if we have to change venues.

###FAQs:    
* ""*I've never been to a meet-up before and am scared. What should I expect and should I wear my fedora?*""

  I've met a crap-load of redditors and 99% of them are **really nice, very bright, and have a teensy dash of autism/ocd/anxiety disorder**. Salt of the Earth, I tell ya!    

  Don't worry! There will be booze and name tags. You don't even have to talk. You can just drink and listen. But, **be prepared to make friends** (uuuug, I know, huh?).

* ""*Do I have to live in the AV to meet up with you guys?*""

  No! Feel free to **take a beautiful drive through the mountains and come hang out**. Palmdale and Lancaster (and the general Antelope Valley) get bad raps, but it's beautiful up here. Come out and actually see the stars!

I've also been told that Holland is very religious as well..so I'm also kind of reluctant about moving out there as well or just wondering if I would personally like the city itself.

Just a bit of information about myself. I'm a raver and love EDM music!! Now.. I know that I probably will not find that in Holland and that is okay. I am aware that I have to put that part of my life on hold until I get my degree. I'm also Cali born and raised and I have never lived outside of California... All and all, I'm just very hesitant and unsure about me liking Holland... So if you guys can answer these questions for me as well as expanding about what you love about Holland, that would be great. It will also be cool to start talking to people as well that are attending GVSU or living in the Holland area so I can make some new friends."|Michigan|2020|False|0
"Not rumor. Public info. I found this out today.

Fiber is closing all full service Fiber Spaces except West Des Moines and Orange County. This means here in Kansas City (Zona Rosa and Westport), Austin, Huntsville, and Provo will no longer have a full service Fiber Space for equipment or customer service issues. 

The last day open is tomorrow according to the sign in the building. According to the employees, most of the equipment is now gone, and they are all losing their jobs after tomorrow, so I wouldn't bother going down there on their last day packing up everything up.

"I have had a bad infestation of pantry moths in my house since early August, which I assumed came in from contaminated food, and I have been doing everything to try and combat them. First, I threw all pantry items away, cleaned heavily, and used pheromone traps to catch the male moths. Secondly, I purchased Trichogramma Wasps which are microscopic parasitic wasps that are supposed to take out the pantry moth larvae. And recently I've even had pest control come to try to help with the fight, all to no avail so far.

Today I was outside and noticed several of these same moths on the OUTSIDE of my window screen trying to get into the house. Are these moths native to the Missouri/Kansas area? Do I have some kind of outdoor infestation going on? I'm very disturbed by this and am becoming worried that I will never get rid of them.

"After watching my wife almost get killed by a texting teenage driver on 85th and the trolley trail track I've created a list of grievances. For a trail that connects tens of thousands of residents to shopping, transportation and one many would use today (cause it's nice AF outside), why is it ass?

Why are we dealing with:

\- Washed out sections of road, you're popping a tire on your bike if you hit some of these or at least could fall off. These are great at night when the non-existent street lights light up the track. Uneven road surfaces are everywhere along the trail but especially near KC Bier co where the gravel is semi washed out and it's like you're testing out the [suspension of a car and defusing a bomb.](https://youtu.be/VTHJ7G8J8OE?t=150)

\- Shitty unreadable sun damaged signage

\- Broken or missing bollards that are jagged and hide under dirt and gravel, again definitely could pop a bike tire on these.

\- The gravel that meets the track's paved intersections are huge bumps for bike riders, and shows no maintenance is being done to keep the track from eroding.

\- No shade???? When it's 90 degrees outside a shady walk or ride can be nice, when it's 85 and the sun is baking you, it's not nice.

\- The light at 85th, where my wife was almost killed, is dangerous. At least could we get some signage in the middle of the road and some brighter flashing lights? Do we have to wait until someone is [killed before it matters?](https://fox4kc.com/news/pedestrian-sustains-life-threatening-injuries-after-vehicle-hits-them-near-63rd-and-brookside-plaza/)

\- Stopping every 500 feet to wait for a street light to change and watch drivers not pay attention to crossing pedestrians sucks.

\- This is grasping at an issue, but the trail could connect even more people and commerce by building to the plaza.

&#x200B;

How can we push city government to maintain our walking and biking infrastructure?  


  


Edit: I called 311, and while KCMO now owns the TTT (Trolley Track Trail) KCATA still maintains it. I've asked for the washed out areas and the missing bollards be replaced, as well as the lips at the start of intersections be looked into. I've also brought up the safety issue on 85th and the TTT and they said they would pass that along as a suggestion. Also, shout out to the 311 and KCATA representatives, they were super nice and I feel like my voice on some of these issues have been heard."|KansasCity|2022|False|0

"Hey all! 

Last night my boyfriend and I were camping at a campground in Lolo, next to the town Wye (we are travelling from NY), and both of us are perplexed as to what the noise we were hearing could be as we haven't heard anything like it before. I've camped in MT many times in the past, too. Maybe we are just a little stupid, though?

It's admittedly hard to describe, but I'll do my best. Sounds like a muffled bass coming from a speaker far away, it starts and gradually gets faster, then stops (much like when you are bouncing a basketball and stop, it will gradually get faster as it gets closer to the ground, until it stops bouncing). 

My boyfriend first heard it around 3 AM and thought he was going nuts. It kept going and eventually we left, happened in intervals of 5 or 10 minutes. 

It sounded muffled in its tone but it was pretty loud and irritating, just since it is a lower frequency noise you can't ignore. 

What is it? Anyone know? Genuinely curious!"|Montana|2016|False|0

"Hi, I am an out of state guy so I'm unable to go back to where this was. I was pulled over on I-85 Northbound for going 76 in a 60 zone. Normally, I would accept tickets because I am that guy that will admit I am wrong. However, I never saw a sign for 60, and I had my car in cruise control at 75. On a hill it pushed my speed to 76, where he clocked me, but put it down to 75 because I told him I had no idea. Plus, I was behind a car and didn't see myself creeping up on him, I felt like part of the flow of traffic. I asked him where it said 60 mph, because I had honestly never seen a sign for it. He stated it was back at 104(mile marker or exit, I don't know.) however, as we left I saw signs for 70 still and cars that were going much faster than me when I went 70. When I caught up to speed with traffic, they all pushed 80 and were still crawling away from me.

All I am wondering is, is there a 60 zone at the location the trooper described? If so I will accept the offense and will blame to myself on not being aware. I'm going through Google and trying to see where it is, I went to mile marker 104 and through it, but saw nothing. Prior to 104 I was a 70mph sign. This happened this past Monday. Should I just call the number on the ticket(by the way, you guys have HUGE tickets.)

Edit: Also, how much am I looking at? Nothing seems to tell me on points and costs. He said the ticket will take time to process, so he told us to wait for it to go through."|Virginia|2017|False|0

"Hey Indy.

Just this year I began to explore the world of tequila, and I've been getting most of my starter recommendations from r/tequila. (They're a wonderful community and extremely helpful for anyone who wants to know more about real and amazing tequila and mezcal.)

Anyway, I wanted to ask if you guys have any recommendations on liquor stores with solid tequila selections. And before I go any further, I want to note that **I'm looking for 100% agave tequilas that aren't made with diffusers**. So no, I don't care about Cuervo or some of the other super cheap mixtos that most Americans identify as ""tequila.""

In particular, I really want to pick up a few bottles of Mi Campo blanco. It's a fantastic new tequila (released just this last November, actually) that's in the $18-25 price point range. I came across it at Sangrita Saloon in Broad Ripple since they're using it as their well. I've looked all over Broad Ripple and some of southern Carmel for it but haven't found any so far.

If you guys have *any* recommendations for liquor stores with hidden gems or just solid selections, please let me know. Also, just because I live on the north side of Indy doesn't mean I won't travel to get a few bottles. My girlfriend works in Speedway and she has family on the south side, so I'm covered everywhere.

**TL;DR:** Looking to buy bottles of nicer sipping tequilas in liquor stores that may have strong tequila selections or hidden gems (such as some older bottles from small family-owned shops). In particular, I'd love to pick up some products of Mi Campo, Fortaleza, G4, Pasote, Siete Leguas, Tapatio, and El Tesoro. I like blancos and reposados the most, but I'm open to great añejos too."|Indianapolis|2019|False|0

"I would like to do a delayed vaccine schedule with my child who is due in October. Mainly I want to delay the HepB - I do NOT want it at birth from the hospital. I would like to space them out, one at a time,  and avoid things like Flu maybe even avoid the RV.

Has anyone done this with their children and if so could you give me a rough idea of their schedule and how to talk to doctors about this in a non-confrontational way.

I want to make this super CLEAR - I want to vaccinate however I want to delay and spread out the vaccines as much as possible. I would also like to drop some of the vaccines which do not prevent life threatening diseases (such as flu and RV)

Thanks so much in advance!

Edit: The personal attacks are childish. So I wont be responding to any more of them. Delayed vaccines does not equal no vaccines however trying to explain that to people is like screaming at a wall. So! If you happened to have used a delayed schedule in MA please pm me! Very interested in your personal experience! If your here to demonize and swear at people feel free to do so below but dont expect a reply or for me to sit here and defend my familes choices. Instead of leaving a nasty comment I would suggest researching both the vaccine inserts and what each vaccine actually does to better understand the topic.

"How much are you paying for eggs?  
  
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is reporting that egg prices in the United States rose dramatically in August, up 28.1 percent from the same period a year ago.

That brought the average national price for a dozen grade eggs to $3.20 in August, according to the BLS. But Connecticut consumers, as well as industry and supermarket officials, say that since then, prices in retailers across the state have begun to decline.

The reason for the price spike is a reduction in the number of hens laying eggs as a result of the Avian flu, said Meghan Bell, a spokeswoman for the Norwalk-based family-owned grocery chain Stew Leonard's.

"Hi. Here's some small advice for when you shop and Stop & Shop.

* Make sure to scan your card/enter your phone number at the savings station once you walk into the store to quickly load in the Digital Coupons. (Ex. In Hamden, the Savings Station is located on the produce side right at the end of Register 21)
* Hamden Stop & Shop closes at midnight every day unless otherwise
* If a sale is too good to be true, double check the location of an item and the tag or ask a store associate before purchasing
* At Hamden Stop & Shop, the doors on the Pharmacy side close at 8pm every night for safety reasons
* At Hamden Stop & Shop, since August 25th of this year, the service desk closes at 7pm.
* Want to keep track of how much you are spending? Pick up a Scan It by the door once you enter the store or use the Scan It app on your phone. It will also, make things go by quicker for both the cashier and the customer. 
* Want to use your Go Points for groceries? Redeem them through the App or the website. Every 100 points is $1 off in groceries.
* Monday-Saturday the store stops selling alcohol at 10pm. On Sundays, the store stops selling alcohol at 6pm.
* Purchasing cold medicine? Make sure to an ID on you. If it has Pseudoephedrine in it, the employee will need to see your ID. *(Pseudoephedrine is found in a number of cold-and-flu tablets, and is known to be an “illicit drug precursor” because it can be diverted into the manufacture of amphetamine-type substances. In some states, only people 18 years of age or older can buy pseudoephedrine.)*

"Whether you call it nCoV-19 or COVID-19 or just “The Coronavirus,” it is here in West Virginia and, undoubtedly, a hell of a lot closer than that.  More reports of confirmed cases in this state and others are coming.  Just keep clean, stay clean, stay home, minimize any contact with others, and you may be OK.

First:  80% of people who DO contract this virus will get sick.  It will not be bad, any more than having the flu or a chest cold might feel.  Those are mild cases.  Isolate yourself.  *Do not have contact with anyone* if it can be avoided.  If you NEED to have physical contact with others, assuming other people in your home, put yourself in a bedroom with bathroom access and lock those areas off.  You have become part of the problem.  

No medical intervention is required with a mild case of COVID-19.  Repeat:  **No medical intervention is required for a mild case of COVID-19.**  but you DO need to keep from giving it to your loved ones or roommates.  Restrict your movements to the two rooms.  Do not let anyone inside those two rooms but people sick with this virus.  This is now your own, personal hot zone.  If you have to leave that room to go to a communal bathroom, wipe down anything and everything in that communal bathroom that you are certain you have touched AND the areas you MAY have touched after you are finished.  Use a clean cloth or paper to touch sink knobs, or toilet handles, or door handles.  IF your skin meets physical contact with a surface, it should be wiped clean as soon as possible.  Have others bring you food if you can, but remember that you are “hot.”  You can be shedding the virus.  That means don’t touch *anybody*, and your plates and silverware and cups are all going to be “hot” until they are adequately cleaned.  **This is only if you believe that you or another has the virus.**

If you are certain you do NOT have the virus, you MAY still have it.  You are just not symptomatic.  But your body is reproducing the virus and putting it out of your body in a solution of droplets:  a sneeze, sweat, snot, blood, anything.  Those droplets are “hot.”  One of the many problems with this particular virus is that you can have it for days and not be aware you are contagious.  Yes, you can be contagious and make others sick without knowing it.  Think about that before you need to leave your house for anything.  
**Do not interact physically with anyone if you suspect you MAY have the virus.**  

If you get to a point where going somewhere else is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, you need to think as if everything you touch, or somebody else touches and then you touch, is contaminated until it can be verified clean.
**Again:  outside of your personal space, consider anything AND everything you touch, anything and everything someone passes to you, contaminated until you can clean it.**  YOUR HANDS will be most of the problem.  They will come in contact with surfaces that may have live virus on them.  Even if you wear gloves, if you touch something with live virus, you can infect yourself if you touch yourself in an area of broken skin or moist mucosa like your eyes, nose, or mouth.  **YOU MUST BE ALERT TO EVERYTHING YOUR HANDS ARE DOING AND WHAT THEY TOUCH.**  

If you contact anything you are not absolutely certain about, wipe your hands clean before you touch yourself anywhere.  This means things you never consciously think about:  **your cellphone.  Touch screens.  ATMs.  Door handles.  ANYTHING YOU TOUCH THAT YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IS CLEAN CAN INFECT YOU.**

Does all of this sound like crazy paranoia and the rantings of an OCD lunatic?  Welcome to the party.  Because you need to be that way in order to keep yourself and others well.  

I know people want to think a barrier like gloves will help.  Only if you changed gloves EVERY SINGLE TIME you touched something or before you touched your face.  That is patently impractical and would destroy resources you need to keep and others need to have. 

If you choose to wear a mask of any kind:  understand that it is largely a barrier to keep YOU from shedding it nasally or orally, or to KEEP you from infecting yourself nasally or orally.  That’s all it can do.  I can explain micron sizes of viruses and masks.  Doesn’t matter.  Those are the only two uses for masks.  If you don’t need them for those reasons, don’t use them!  Don’t buy them!  Others will!  Not just doctors, hospitals, first responders, but people like cancer patients, others with weak or compromised immune systems and countless others you are not thinking about.  But you cannot feel safe wearing ANY kind of mask.  You can still touch your eyes, or other things can touch your eyes unless they are sealed off behind a face shield or sealing goggles that would then need to be disinfected before being used again.  

**WASHING YOUR HANDS AND STAYING AWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE TOUCHING AT ALL TIMES IS GOING TO HELP YOU STAY WELL.**  Wash under warm water for 20 seconds, scrubbing your hands completely.  If you want to feel like a doctor doing it, more power to you, as long as your hands get completely clean doing it, because the very next thing you touch, a towel or a door knob, or a box of Rice Krispies, can expose those clean hands to virus again.  I can explain lipid layers and viruses all day.  This is what you NEED to know:  *Wash your damned hands the way you should have always been doing it anyway.  Then keep them in your pockets (assuming they are virus free) or away from any surface.*  **20 seconds is about how long it takes to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to someone twice.  Depending on how quickly you sing it, THAT will not make your hands cleaner.  Only the 20 seconds of warm water and soap can do that.**

TRY to keep a clean bottle of hand sanitizer and use it liberally, as if your life depended on it.  **This virus can live on certain surfaces for up to 9 days.**  Alcohol can kill it.  Isopropyl or rubbing alcohol can kill it, but if you can avoid retouching surfaces, do so.  ANY contact with a surface can expose you.  

**DO NOT SHARE FOOD OR DRINK WITH ANYONE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.**  YOU might have it.  THEY might have it.  Sharing just means you can have it TOGETHER.  Don’t do it.  Don’t eat out of communal containers like popcorn or other snacks.  

We need to take care of ourselves first, if we want to help anyone else, AND WE NEED TO HELP OTHERS, TOO.  If that means NOT HOARDING TOILET PAPER, then don’t be an idiot and get only as much as you are going to need.  Don’t buy face masks or gloves if you don’t need to.  Keep to yourself, don’t go to public areas, don’t physically contact or even come within spitting distance of other people if you can avoid it in any way.

"I'm posting this from a comment of information I put together. I'm hoping that if anyone has family, coworkers or friends who are ignoring or not grasping the danger for WV will have this information to help put in to perspective the risk that WV is facing.

It's going to hit WV really bad. [Read what the WV Governor is telling people](http://wvmetronews.com/2020/03/16/justice-act-as-if-its-here-testing-capacity-is-frustrating-no-need-yet-to-shut-down-bars-and-restaurants/)

>The state leaders expressed frustration that only 500 testing kits have been available in West Virginia so far — and those have only been made functional by jerry-rigging some flu test kits.

Right now WV has no testing kits from a national level sent to help. The hospitals in the state have figured out how to test using existing flu test kits and information available on the COVID-19.  [16% of the state is over 65](http://censusviewer.com/state/WV), and most of the over-65 are *over 75*!

[26% of people smoke in WV](https://truthinitiative.org/research-resources/smoking-region/tobacco-use-west-virginia-2019), and WV is [often tied with](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/Obesity/state/WV) or [is the most obese state](https://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/west-virginia-ranks-as-most-obese-state/article_8940981f-c9df-588d-be98-4ee748b431f5.html).

[WV is a walking time bomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/weve-got-a-monster-thats-looming-west-virginia-is-the-last-state-without-a-coronavirus-case.html?searchResultPosition=1). Compare Italy, right now with 7.7% mortality rate, much of which is due to the [aging population with a median of 47.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/) Then compare small towns in WV like [Grafton, WV with a median age of 45](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/grafton-wv-population/). WV is sprinkled with small towns with similar demographics.

Now combine all of this with the [worst state for opioid deaths and prescriptions](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-summaries-by-state), the [bias from conservative news on corona virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-conservative-media.html), and that [Trump won WV in 2016 by over 40 points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_West_Virginia). And finally add in that [a major regional hospital in WV is closing right now!](https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/business/2020/02/fairmont-regional-medical-center-to-close/)

There are going to be a lot of very sad stories coming out of WV very soon, and at this point it's going to be very difficult to turn the tide in favor of the aging population. That said, I've had success sending family members [this excerpt from the Joe Rogan and an Epidemiologist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFhjMQrVts&feature=emb_title) or a view of how newspapers have had to [show so many more obituaries](https://twitter.com/benphillips76/status/1238854071509016577?s=09)."|WestVirginia|2020|True|0
"If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent social distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [190,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf))

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* **Update:** March 17th: [Short video of the situation in a hospital in Bergamo, Italy](https://twitter.com/Laethageal/status/1239699270577553409). Do not underestimate this virus.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). Update: [Speed trumps perfection](https://twitter.com/ConallMcD/status/1238865202868883461).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm)

70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w)

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Hey y’all, I got the COVID vaccine Friday so I figured I’d share my experience/give you the rundown of what it’s like here in RI. I’ve also included links to the current situation over here/more info about the COVID vaccine in general.

I work as a healthcare professional, so we all got emails from the board of health when it was our specific field’s turn to get the vaccine. The email included directions to the facility/a link to the website, which asked a series of questions; have we contracted COVID, any current symptoms, any contact with a person that was infected, and whether or not we’ve been required to quarantine within the past few weeks. Next, we gave our phone number, street and email addresses and a photo copy of health insurance cards. After that, you specify whether it’s your first or second dose, and are given a list of dates and times to chose from. I specifically got the Moderna vaccine, which requires you to come back in 28 days for the second dose. You will set up the second appointment during your first visit.

The day before my appointment, I got a reminder in my email including more directions to the facility in Cranston. On the day of, I arrived to the parking lot to be greeted by military personnel asking if I had an appointment. After that, I was flagged to the parking lot and went inside to a series of “check points”. At the first, my temperature was taken by a military official and I was sent forward to the next station. There were about 6 of us in line (at 6 feet apart) and we were asked the same COVID questions as the online questionnaire, then sent forward to the next station. I was asked to give my license, and he wrote down my info on a card and sent me forward. At the next station, I was asked which arm I would like to have the shot in, and she wrote it down on a slip/copied some of the info from the card and gave both the card and slip to me (the slip you eventually give back to military personnel, the card you keep - according to the military official who gave me the shot, you need to keep this as it is your only means of proving you’ve gotten the vaccine). I was then sent forward to my own booth, where another military official asked if I’ve ever had any adverse reactions to a vaccine and administered it. The shot itself felt no different to me than getting a flu shot, but I’ve heard varied responses to this from my colleagues; this could obviously be different for everyone regarding your own health issues/past experiences with vaccines/pain threshold and tolerance. I also recommend you bring your own band aid if you have issues with bleeding (are on blood thinners, aspirin regimen etc.) as they did not supply me with one. 

After getting my dose, he checked off my card and I was sent to an “observatory station” where I was required to sit for 15 minutes - they wrote the current time/the time I could move forward on my slip. Once I got to the observatory station, there was a laminated piece of paper on my chair with a QR code. I used the camera in my phone to scan the QR code, which brought me to the website to set up my second appointment. It immediately brings you to at least 28 days later and the process was the same setup as it was for the initial appointment. Once the 15 minutes were up, I went up to the desk where the observing military personnel were. They asked if I felt ok, was there any dizziness/discomfort and signed off on my slip. I was then sent forward to the final station where I gave my slip to the military official, was asked if I had any other questions and was free to go out the back entrance.

The first night after getting the shot was fine, I felt a little sore but nothing extreme. For the rest of the weekend, my arm felt like it was punched a total of 20 times and it was uncomfortable to lift past my ribs. Today it is more or less back to normal.

I also wanted to add, the military personnel were hilarious and made the whole situation way less boring than it could’ve been.

[Here is a link to the current COVID vaccine info in Rhode Island](https://covid.ri.gov/vaccination). This link includes weekly updates and specifics on when each group (healthcare or otherwise) is expected to be eligible. Feel free to ask me any questions :)

"If you look around the country and the world the numbers are high but for some reason there are a few places like Nebraska where the numbers are staying really low (comparatively) and I do not understand why.  Is there something special about this area?  Is the airbase's OmaDome killing Covid?  Are nebraskans just super saiyans and covid doesn't stand a chance against us?  Why are we so special?


I guess I should edit this.  mvoviri pointed out we are 5th highest in infections but according to how the state is handling things and the current hospital trend you would not think this.  Do we have a high infection rate and a low severe infection rate?  Why are our numbers dropping like the bass at a skrillex concert?  Why does life seem so normal here vs other places that are maxed out hospital wise and locking things down?  Nothing lines up and it is very confusing what is happening.

"EDIT: sold. Thank you. 

Many years ago, I purchased a few original Harper's Weekly newspapers featuring the engravings of Thomas Nast, including ""The Blessings of Victory"".    I framed a couple for myself (this one and another celebrating July 4th 1864) and placed the other on a shelf and forgot about it until my wife and I were doing a little quarantine clear-out.

This is from an auction site regarding this particular print ""The Blessings of Victory"" and Thomas Nast:

>Nast engraves an optimistic scene of what was to come with victory of the Union. Two women hold hands, one raises a palm leaf while the other raises her sword. Six separate scenes surround them showing prisoner's of war being released, a veteran coming home, happy African Americans no longer bound by slavery, and the traitors in prison.  
>  
>Nast is credited for being the ""Father of the American Cartoon"" and is considered one of the most popular political cartoonists of all time. He created many still-popular images such as: the elephant and donkey as representations for the Democratic and Republican party, the modern Santa Claus, and other iconic political cartoons. He sparred against political corruption and slavery. Lincoln hailed him as the ""best recruiting sergeant"" for the Union because his images inspired many men to enlist. He continued to sketch until 1902 when President Roosevelt appointed him U.S. counsel general for Ecuador. He entered Ecuador in the midst of a massive yellow fever outbreak. He contracted the disease and died, leaving behind many unpaid debts but a lasting artistic legacy. 

This particular piece was printed in Harper's Weekly on September 24th, 1864 as part of a campaign of pro-Union engravings leading up to the election.

I'm selling the entire newspaper, not just the centerfold for $75, the minimum I've seen this sold online for.  It also has other engraving illustrations.  [Here's an amazon digital copy.](https://www.amazon.com/Harpers-Weekly-September-24-1864/dp/1557098026)

"COVID QUESTIONS. Anyone able to help?

Hi all. 

I’ve been out of work for the last two weeks with a myriad of symptoms.  Refused to be hospitalized two weeks ago due to cost concerns with my insurance, but the issues range from low oxygen levels, shortness of breath, mild to high fever, fatigue and body pain. 

I took a covid test on October 16th, it came back negative.  I have had chest X-rays done as well, which didn’t show signs of pneumonia.  Been on antibiotics shortly, and about to start a second round of steroids.  

I have a large deductible and not in a financial position to go to the hospital unless I was dying.   However, I still don’t have a confirmed Covid diagnosis.  I asked my doctor if I should take another test and she said that it wasn’t necessary because it wouldn’t change the treatment plan.   Another doctor in her office said that it was utmost important.  Obviously I’m also worried about getting a positive diagnosis and having that as a pre-existing condition.  So I’m really confused right now and I’ve already seemingly had a false negative or an insufficient swab.  

Work has been allowing me to not be there, but they believe they need a positive diagnosis for Covid, to pay me under the Family’s First Act.   The tests however also come with a disclaimer that it isn’t always accurate and that docs should use additional data to make a diagnosis.  

Has anyone had any similar difficulties navigating this or might have any insight as to how I can best proceed while also not putting myself into financial hardship?  Everytime I ask my doctor if I can rule out covid, she says no, but meanwhile, I can’t go back to work because I’m symptomatic and haven’t had a three day window without a fever.  But she also won’t say that I have covid.  What do I do??"|Ohio|2020|True|1
"Hey, y’all. My family just moved from the Deep South to Indianapolis this summer. We love the town and our neighbors, but my partner and I are a bit worried about our kids getting cabin fever during the winter months. 

We have a house with a backyard, and we’re pretty well outfitted with cold weather gear. I’m thinking maybe we could set up some sort of semi-permanent obstacle course in the backyard, maybe? We usually take them to parks or trails or playgrounds, but the kids are young enough that their mittens (and their hands, for that matter) aren’t super flexible and useful, so I’m not confident in their abilities to hang on to ladders and stuff at playgrounds. 

So I turn to the collected knowledge of the Indianapolis subreddit - what do y’all do with your kids, or what did you do as a kid? How do you get the energy out? Any suggestions are super welcome! Thanks!"|Indianapolis|2020|True|0

"I caught it in November, ignored it because it seemed like it was just seasonal allergies at first. That developed into a full blown respiratory infection that took the entire month to get rid of.

"Hi, I have 4 dogs well-established at a vet clinic. One dog is sensitive to vaccines, so we did the annual exam last week and the vet split the vaccine cocktail into two sessions. 

Today we came back just for Lepto and was charged for an exam. The vet told me state law says:

1) Aside from Bordetella, only vets (not techs) can administer vaccines 

2) Exam and exam fee is required before administering a vaccine 

Last year at a different TX vet I could get all 4 dogs vaccinated against the canine flu under 1 “office visit” expense + 4 vaccines. 

Did something change with the law or am I being played?

"While millions of Texans remain without power following Hurricane Beryl, The National Weather Service of Houston has issued a heat advisory for Tuesday. The humidity can cause the heat to feel even hotter and the amount of water vapor in the air can make sweating less effective, making it more difficult to stay cool.

If you're without power, here are some tips to stay cool, signs of heat illness to watch out for and how to stay safe if using a generator.

  
**How to keep your residence cool:**

* Keep sunny windows covered with curtains, shades or blinds.
* If you have a gas stove and oven that can run without electricity, try to minimize its use.
* If it’s safe for you to travel, consider going to a public library or emergency shelter with power. Even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler when you go back into the heat.
* Follow city officials and local media to see if any hurricane emergency relief shelters are open and have power. 

  
**How to keep yourself cool:**

* Drink water consistently – even when not thirsty. Avoid sugary drinks, caffeine and alcohol. Also avoid cold drinks because they can cause stomach cramps.
* Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing.
* Minimize recreational exercise as your body will struggle to cool back down.
* Take cool showers or baths.
* Avoid large, hot meals because they add heat to your body. 
* Know if your medication makes you vulnerable. Some medications might make skin more sensitive to the sun or make you feel less thirsty. These include aspirin and acetaminophen, diuretics and beta blockers, psychiatric medications such as lithium, and anti-seizure medications such as Topiramate and Oxcarbazepine. High temperatures can also damage a medication if it’s not stored properly, or make inhalers or EpiPens malfunction, according to the \~CDC\~.
* Avoid stimulants and hallucinogens. Street drugs like cocaine and MDMA can reduce how much you sweat, reduce how much your skin blood vessels enlarge and impair your perception of heat.

  
**Signs of heat illness to watch out for:**

Promptly take action if you or someone else starts to feel sick. Check in on friends and relatives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heat-related illnesses include:

* **Heat exhaustion:** Marked by profuse sweating, clammy skin, nausea, dizziness, headache and fainting. The CDC recommends that people with those symptoms move to a cool place, loosen clothes, put wet cloths on your skin and drink water. Get medical help if you are throwing up, your symptoms worsen or your symptoms last more than an hour.
* **Heat stroke:** Body temperature of 103 degrees or more, rapid pulse, throbbing headache, confusion and passing out. This can be life-threatening. Call 911 immediately, move to a cooler place, put cool cloths on skin and don’t drink anything.
* **Heat cramps:** Symptoms include muscle pain and spasms and lots of sweating. Stop physical activity, go to a cool place and drink water or a sports drink. Wait until the cramps have gone away to continue physical activity. If your cramps last more than an hour or you have heart problems or are on a low-sodium diet, seek medical attention.
* **Heat rash:** Also called prickly heat, this is when small red blisters form on the skin. Stay in a cool and dry place, keep the rash dry and use baby powder to soothe the rash.

  
**How to stay safe if using a generator:** 

* Carbon monoxide is produced when not enough oxygen is reaching a fuel-burning source.
* Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, colorless gas that can cause serious injury or even death if inhaled in large quantities. Early symptoms can include headache, dizziness and nausea, similar to the flu. If you feel these symptoms and suspect poisoning, leave the house immediately and seek medical help.
* Make sure to have a carbon monoxide alarm installed in your home before using a generator. If the alarm goes off, leave the home immediately and call 911.

"The head of an influential hospital trade group told a legislative committee Thursday that the state has had a “terrifying increase” in the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients over the past month, as medical facilities are contending with shortages in staffing and available beds. “As of Tuesday, there were 1,411 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [statewide]. A month ago there were 550,” said Steve Walsh, president and chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association. “And if that trend continues after the New Year, we’re going to have increasing problems,” he said. A mass casualty incident or bad flu outbreak could then hinder the capability of the hospital system to cope with demands, he said.

I was in a crash a few days ago. I was at a break in double white lines indicating right.

It was some 20year old guy, said sorry heaps at the time, gave me his details. I called insurance company and the little punk has filed it as me being at fault. Insurance company said they won't repair my car until he admits fault since I've only got third party. It's taking me 4 hours on hold to get through to insurance company each time I call and I need a car urgently for kids school drop off and work so this whole thing is a nightmare.

"Hey ya'll, 

My partner moved to Providence recently and he's had a doozy of issues since moving here, only 2 months ago. 

One of them is that there is an overwhelmingly disgusting smell coming from his shower drain, to the point where he's had constant headaches. He investigated the drain and saw the pipe was rusty and falling apart. He mentioned it to the landlord and he came by and brought a plumber to fix the pipe, thinking that would solve the problem. 

Nope, gas smell is still engulfing his bathroom. It's disgusting. He brings up the smell again the landlord and says for my partner to find a plumber to deal with it. He has GEM come by and the technicians literally say they can't smell anything, and just recock the wax around the toilet (they were basically useless). 

When the landlord was by the place he also said he couldn't smell anything. I feel bad because my partner has been going crazy about the smell and it's effecting his health, he can't even take a shower in his own apartment (he comes over to my place to use mine.)

Finally he went to Home Depot and got a gas detector that let's you know if there is a gas leak and low-and-behold, it detects a gas from his shower drain. He took videos demonstrating the gas detector going off to send to the landlord tomorrow. 

I've been doing research to find out what his rights are exactly as a tenant in this situation. It seems like the landlord isn't taking him seriously / doesn't care and it's frustrating. I found in some cases this can be a breach of an agreement in his lease as it's hazardous to have a gas leak into the apartment that can effect your health - making it uninhabitable. Any recommendations or advice is welcome.

I feel bad because he just moved to Providence and this is his experience so far. (outside of a number of things that have happened within the span of 2 months that have been not great.) "|RhodeIsland|2024|True|0

"I'm originally from the Mid West but lived in Idaho at about 4,800ft elevation for 4 years. I frequently visited family in the Midwest & South and never had any problems.

"WCCO aired the first in a series of reports on the fentanyl crisis in Minnesota.  

The accompanying web article states that “We start with the problem. Last year alone, the Drug Enforcement Agency seized the equivalent of more than 387 million lethal doses of fentanyl….”

Like so many other drug-related news stories, they’ve totally missed the mark by focusing on the supply rather than the demand for fentanyl.  Any news story that suggests it’s “starting with the problem” and doesn’t address the demand is focusing on the symptom rather than the cause.  Stories like this, unfortunately, shift the attention of the public, and move us away from dealing with the heart of the issue.

"Hi,

Posting to see if anyone here has had to navigate treatment for an unwilling parent suffering from severe mental illness. My mother’s mental health has dramatically declined since symptoms first began to appear in early months of Covid during 2020. She is convinced the government is attempting to take her life and that her family (us) are also involved in the conspiracy.

She has refused to get help and claims instead that everyone around her is mentally deranged. We know part of the disease is the inability of the person suffering to realize they are ill. She is in her 60s and her health is deteriorating.

Note she still eats but her weight has fallen significantly. Bulk of what she consumes now consists of plastic, gas station esque food since she is convinced fresh produce (I.e. not plastic sealed) has been poisoned in advance. 

We don’t know what to do at this point beyond trying our best to tolerate and be patient; however, I am afraid she can’t continue much longer like this given her already frail health prior to this illness taking her.

Has anyone gone through the same that can consult? She’s cautious to avoid saying things related to self harm to avoid us calling police/recording for court. We previously had her hospitalized for a day related to extremely high blood pressure during an episode of psychosis, but doctors released her immediately after.

NAMI offered little in terms of any leeway we have navigating legal system to get her mandatory treatment. We know the threshold for forced treatment is high but there has to be some type of short cuts or tricks even as far as falsely claiming she has threatened suicide. At this point, letting her continue untreated is the equivalent of a death sentence."|Chicago|2023|False|0
"I had/have mild symptoms (super sore throat, runny nose) and so I knew I should get tested - but the question was how, without putting other people at risk?  I don't have a car and while there is a testing clinic within walking distance of my home, it is drive-through only.

After some searching around it came to my attention there is self-testing available in Sydney through Histopath ([covidtestsydney.com.au](https://covidtestsydney.com.au)).  A testing kit is couriered to you and returned to pathology, without you needing to leave the house at all.  I hadn't heard about this before and I was frankly a bit dubious about it given the press around dodgy home-testing kits.  However, the service is referred to expressly on the NSW Health website and they have a physical testing clinic, so I felt confident enough to give it a go.

The general time-line was as follows:

8am: Complete online questionnaire (medicare details must be provided).

9:15am: Receive call from Histopath informing me that a courier would text me with their ETA and instructions.

10:am: Receive foreshadowed SMS from courier.  I watch the instructional video.

10:30am: Courier arrives on time and leaves a testing kit at my front door. He tells me (from a distance) he'll wait around until I've finished and it should only take 5 minutes.

I conducted the test (nose and throat swab - not pleasant TBH!), packaged up the swabs and then placed it in the bucket left for me at my front door to be retrieved by the courier. I probably took something more like 10 minutes as I read the written instructions accompanying the kit in detail.

11am: Receive call from a doctor asking about symptoms and whether the courier had already attended.

Next day 1pm: negative result SMS received - phew!

I paid nothing for the service.

This is a great option for people who are able-bodied enough (and confident enough) to administer the test properly themselves but unable to reach a testing clinic. I also note all the material was in English, so may not be easy to follow for non-English speakers (although there was a video)."|sydney|2020|False|1
"I went for a covid test this afternoon, it was relatively easy and I wanted to share in case anyone was on the fence about getting tested - please do so.

This morning I had a headache, nasal congestion and fatigue and on/off sore throat which was only mild. I was still feeling crap by the afternoon so I rang the corona hotline (1800 020 080) and went through the symptoms checker. You can chose to speak to someone or just use the automated system. I used the automated system. At the end, it recommended I get tested and asked if I wanted a text message sent to me. The text came through immediately.

I looked up online where to get tested. I went to Randwick POW hospital which has a walk up clinic, no referral needed but you need to have symptoms or have a reason (ie close contact of confirmed case).

I went to the clinic, arrived around 4:20pm, there was a queue outside of about 10-12 people, everyone was socially distancing. Note you have to wear a mask when you go to get tested. While in the outside queue, a nurse gave us all a sheet about how to register for sms results. I registered in the queue. I then got a clipboard and pen to fill out my details, personal info, medicare no, regular doctor, symptoms, emergency contact etc. 

Some dip shit drove past the clinic and shouted at us all, 'you've all got corona', thanks mate, nice. 

I got to the head of the queue and went inside the building. I'd been waiting about 25 minutes by that stage. Sanitise hands. My temperature was taken via ear thermometer, blood pressure/heart rate via a finger clip. Then went inside and sat down waited for my name to be called, cute nurse said it should take approx 30 mins from then. They checked a few details about my name and my regular doctor and I'd missed a page about any medication or serious health issues. Filled that out. 

Then, my name got called. They did the finger clip checks again, confirmed my DOB and my answers, asked me what I did for work and if I'd been in any high risk areas (overseas, Melbourne, and a list of NSW hotspots). Then walked me to the swab queue. I waited 5 mins in the swab queue till it was my turn. 

Sat in the chair, the nurse pulls out the big swab. She said she was going to swab my throat and both nostrils.  Swabbed my throat, made me gag slightly, then did each nostril - nostrils not great, felt like when water goes up your nose at the pool, all tingly and eyes watered, but honestly only lasted a few seconds. It's the same swab for throat and nostrils so I joked I was glad they do the throat first. 

Then went to the front desk to get my paperwork. Paperwork includes a doctors certificate that covered 2 days including today, directions on self isolation and what to expect when you get results. They asked if I needed any masks but I said I was fine as I have some at home. And that's it, go home and isolate and wait for sms results which could be up to 72 hours.  End to end the whole process took just over an hour. 

The nurses were excellent, you could tell they were busy but were still very friendly, calm and reassuring to everyone. 

The biggest thing for me was feeling like a bit of a leper while on the queue outside on the main street and just the overall sense of being a sickly outcast. I think it's overwhelmingly better to feel like a leper for a short while and get tested for peace of mind and the overall health of our community. There was a doctor getting tested himself at the same time - he was chatting with all the nurses. It really is just a routine test that everyone should have if they are feeling even mildly unwell."|sydney|2020|True|1

The whole process was really easy too, it only took half an hour in and out, most of which was waiting in line (actual swab took like 2 minutes). It was free (even if you don't have medicare), they gave you masks, and they give you the results over text. 

Everyone should definitely get tested if you have symptoms! You might only need to isolate for like half a day, and it's the only way of preventing another outbreak."|sydney|2020|True|1

I’m somewhat new to Sydney (1 year) so I don’t have a GP so I searched up a place where you didn’t need a referral. 

I used the map at [NSW Health](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/clinics.aspx) and found a place where you could just text your name and time and fill in a form. 

Testing itself was very easy, they were ready for me as soon as I arrived and it all took less than a minute. They just shoved a swab in my throat and nose and voila. 

Drove home and hid out in my room, and got the text that I was negative before midnight (Was tested around midday).

For me I was planning on seeing a friend later and I was scared of passing something onto them. So now I’ll just see them next weekend instead when I’m better.

>Osterholm says. ""I liken it to trying to plant your petunias in the middle of a Category 5 hurricane.""

What he was actually saying was 

>Testing, contact tracing and isolation are the tactics being used successfully to crush outbreaks in countries such as South Korea and Germany. But those places never had the level of case surges that many U.S. states are now experiencing.

>""When you have something like this happening, there's no way that traditional testing and tracing is going to have any meaningful impact,"" Osterholm says. 

> At this point, there are just too many new infections occurring too quickly for underfunded, understaffed public health departments to effectively use testing and contract tracing, according to Dr. Jeffrey Engel, the senior adviser for the COVID-19 response for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

Futhermore, the Rep from Johns Hopkins stated

>""Given our basic failure to fix the gaps in testing and the bottlenecks, that really puts us on a path where there is no viable alternative beyond shutdowns,"" says Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

>Now, Nuzzo doesn't think all hope is lost. If enough people finally start wearing masks, and get vigilant about staying at least 6 feet away from other people, especially indoors, there may still be hope in at least some places of avoiding new shutdowns, she says.

When asked what would work, Osterholm says

>""We will not get there unless we bring this virus level down again. **And there's just no other way to do it literally but a kind of second lockdown,**"" he says. ""And this time let's get it right.""

As a younger adult in good health why should I care about wearing my mask anymore? I mean I wear my mask every second I'm out in public but literally no one else around me does. The stores I walk into say masks are required but the majority of people in them aren't wearing them and the employees greet them as they walk in and don't say shit about them not wearing a mask. Why should I give two shits about wearing mine? I'm not sick and I'm only wearing my mask to protect others from potentially catching the virus from me if I'm asymptomatic. But clearly none of them give a shit about protecting me .. fuck everybody.. and no i don't mean you guys b/c the majority of people on Reddit know how to use their brain unlike those who can't figure out that their caps lock is on when their password won't work|Ohio|2020|True|0
"Can the apartment manager have cars towed if their tags expired recently? 

The virus made it difficult for some people to renew their tags and from what I’ve researched the state of Ohio was extending expired tags. 

On the BMV website it states, “If a customer’s license, ID card, or vehicle registration (including plates and stickers) expired on or after March 9, 2020, the expiration date has been automatically extended until 90 days after Ohio's state of emergency ends or December 1, 2020, whichever comes first.”

Of course if it’s written in the lease that you will maintain current tags on the car I figured there might not be much that people can do about it? Even with BMVs having just been reopened to the public May 26, 2020."|Ohio|2020|True|0

"Hey all,

First thank you to the community as I've gotten most answers here and the 2 times I've spoken with anyone helpful it seems most everything is accurate. 

So I am turning to the reddit community for help here.

I had UI that exhausted and year ended late 2019...through alot of confusing weeks after I FINALLY found out that ANY help was available it was quite clear I should not go on PUA but back on UI instead. So my first call in the lady was helpful and said I did qualify for the extension because my benifit year end date and because I had correspondence about exactly that. She submitted over the phone for me...after many calls, hang ups etc nearly 30 days later she checked my file, saw no help, called back. So we filed the 13 weeks over the phone and I was under the impression all was good. Then they all changed to ""break in claim"" yet my balance updated and finally even a correspondence ""allowed"" (the UI claim was denied which I think that is supposed to be to go back to the 2019 end date?) Which that's sort of odd that it would allow, put a balance, then say break in claim. I know she said she needed a supervisor to fix it because she accidently missed a week and had to go back. 

The person I spoke to yesterday was helpful too and both say that even the 20 week extension applies in my case (no ""allowed"" letter though so we will see). I read that this needs staff intervention and also can mean pay was reported or over benifit or something to that effect, which that was why I called yesterday. I also emailed a help desk I've seen others here successful with. 

So my questions are with 13+ weeks now all showing as ""break in claim"", allowed EUC correspondence and all that the first question I have is is this happening because of the UI being denied? (I have time to appeal..or submit ""fact finding"" rather) is there any more I can do? I'm really at a loss here and frustrated that it seems only one employee can get actual movement to happen.

Also I should note that I am quite concerned that my likeness or information is out there somewhere as my laptop definitely has some sort of virus, malware or spyware and I cant say exactly for how long. I do have the fraud # etc...even though I cant say for sure if my likeness is being used should I briefly explain that in an email or call to that department as well? 

Extremely frustrated and just praying for some sort of movement because this is becoming ALOT owed (15 weeks) if counting the extra 600 and clearly have bills to pay. I've lost weight and am very skinny to begin with, constantly stress, and just dont know what else I can possibly even do. The reps hang up, promise a call back (which never happens aside one that wasnt promised) or simply put me back in the main menu to start over. 

Any help would be very much appreciated.  I emailed the owcms help desk I've seen referenced here. Praying this isnt even more of a waiting game!!"|Ohio|2020|True|0
We see what’s going on in the US. We are closely following the same trend on the charts as Arizona, cases went flat, and slowly started creeping up. I hear people stating that the death count isn’t high but let’s not forget. Deaths lag 2-3 weeks and you have to assume their is double the cases as testing isn’t that officiant right now. If we had rampant testing and contact traced throughout the US we probably wouldn’t be in this situation. Stating that, it’s to late now for the contact tracing as the virus has spread way to much. I wouldn’t oppose a stay at home order IF the government came up with a solution to hold people over until it cooled down. What is your opinion and how do you feel about what’s happening?|Ohio|2020|True|0
"I didn't get to watch it, but I caught the summary which is basically that outdoor visits will now be allowed at retirement/rest homes.

Seeing the cases rise rapidly in other states and seeing how few people are still taking safety procedures, I think its inevitable that the US is going to get rocked by covid in the next couple months. I can just imagine the cases absolutely skyrocketing in the fall and winter. And whether or not they do so consciously, I think everyone knows that and that is why the patios and beaches are packed with people trying to soak up the last bit of normalcy that we can expect to have for a white. 

I think today's press conference was DeWines very dry and clerical way of telling us to go and see your mom, dad, grandma, or grandpa, a time or two before the virus takes them.

I wish this was all some liberal conspiracy by Bill Gates to inject you with 5g, but it's real and its deadly and I fear that soon everyone will know someone who had it and didn't make it through. Or made it through with lasting damage.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have a bud light at the bar and ride the Millenium Force and not wear a face mask because I have a medical condition and masks suck all the oxygen out of the air and infect us with Obama sheeple."|Ohio|2020|True|0

I'm wearing a tie from Cuyahoga Community College today.

COVID-19 testing may now occur for anyone who wants one. Prior to this time we were in the mindset that these resources were scarce but we now believe that we have solved many of the previous issues. Our Minority Task Force will partner with community health centers and the National Guard to create pop-up testing centers where anyone can come to get tested. We'll increase the number and location of these sites as time goes on.

Places of worship have not been subject to closing. Most of them have chosen to do so however. They have done their services through digital means or by drive-through service. We have put together best practices for these places as people start going to the physical location again. These are a suggestion, not a requirement.

We've made a lot of progress in reopening the economy. There were around 35,000 new jobless claims last week. That is more than 200,000 less than we had on average throughout this crisis. Renewals of jobless claims have also decreased. 

The London Stock Exchange is now going to be located in Cleveland, Ohio. This will allow for increased capital for businesses within Ohio. Thirteen minority-owned businesses in Stark County will be some of the first to get access to that capital. This was a program that started before COVID-19 became such a large issue. 

ODJFS is getting a grant for training and a grant for helping Ohioans to get access to new jobs. These grants will be distributed at a local level. Prior to COVID-19, we saw dynamic changes to the economic situation and with COVID-19, many of these changes are moving at an increased rate, especially in regards to tele-health and similar improvements.

Ohio's Department of Health under Amy Acton focused on lead paint prevention and several other important issues. When COVID-19 appeared in China, her advice is what helped me and Ohio move forward to protect Ohioans. However, she has decided to step down. She will continue to advise me on health issues. I asked her to do this. I have asked Lance Himes to be her replacement. It is hard for me to put into words how grateful I am to Amy Acton. She will continue to focus on COVID-19 but look into public health work as well.

I never expected I'd get a job like this. When I did, I wanted to make Ohio a place where all Ohioans have the ability to get access to the care they need. Still, I'm only a representative of many people in Ohio. The entire Department of Health and especially Lance Himes were extremely important to me in everything I've done so far. I'm so grateful to have served with you. I'd also like to thank the State Highway Patrol for keeping everyone safe. I'd also like to thank the other cabinet directors for doing so much for Ohioans. Thank you to the Governor's team, including the Lieutenant Governor. Thank you to our media team and to the press. Finally, thank you to Governor Dewine and to Fran, for doing so much for me and serving Ohio however they can. 

To every Ohioan, I believe you have saved lives through all you have done. We're still going through this journey together, with all these challenges. Still, I believe it has allowed us to see things in a new light and created new opportunities to improve ourselves.

2:36 PM: Question Period Begins

The YouTube stream broke immediately at this point so I missed the first question.

2:38 PM: **Can you tell us where exactly Ohioans are getting sick? Bars? Churches? Work?**

Amy Acton: We've seen many different situations where people get sick. From the most high risk situation, such as in the hospital, to cases where we've seen no obvious way that people have been infected. Spending a long time in close proximity and not wearing a mask are heavy risk factors. The virus is still here and ready to infect us. You don't have to be perfect but everything you do will help keep everyone safe. 

Even when we take the best precautions, COVID-19 can still spread and it's important to remember that.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2:42 PM: **There has been a surge in many states, do you plan to show us if we're seeing a surge as you mentioned you would on Tuesday?**

Governor: Without intervention, COVID-19 will likely spread from one person to 2-3 people in general. Ohio's specific spread was a little less than 2 without intervention. On June 1st, it was slightly less than 1. We saw a slight increase in most of Ohio as time moved forward from May to June. The region surrounding Dayton is currently seeing a rate of 1.07, which is the most in the state. I intend to update this information as the weeks go on. I don't believe there's cause for alarm just yet but the numbers are certainly increasing. Mother's Day may have been a factor in these increases.

Amy Acton: We're looking at many factors throughout this time period. Many of these factors weren't tracked prior to this time. We're making advances and the ones working behind the scenes are excelling at their job. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:48 PM: **How did you feel about all of the negative attention you received during this time period? Is there anything you would change?**

Amy Acton: All of this was new for me. My focus has always been on protecting Ohioans. I had to focus on that. I hope that with me stepping down, I can more easily interact with people and hear their stories. I want to better understand where the dissent is coming from. 
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:51 PM: **What is the status of anti-body testing?**

Amy Acton: That testing is still underway. 1,200 people will volunteer to create a representative sample. One adult in every household will be eligible to volunteer. The hope is to have some of the data ready in July. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:52 PM: **Can you define contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and what will be voluntary or mandatory?**

Governor: I don't understand what you mean by this question. I'll have to look into it. Contact tracing has been going on forever. 

Amy Acton: Isolation is when you're ill and quarantine is for those who might be ill. Many of the laws on the books for diseases are from a long time ago. It will only be mandatory in extreme cases, where people are purposefully putting people at risk. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: **Why have you decided to leave your position at this point?**

Amy Acton: I've been trying to decide what to do for several months actually. We're certainly entering a new phase and I think this is a sort of natural shift for me to get a better focus. I think this will allow me to serve Ohio better.

2:05 PM: Stream hasn't started for me yet. And then it randomly did.

Governor: George Floyd's funeral began not to long ago. We're making efforts to improve our policing in our own state. My predecessor, John Kasich began this process. We're going to continue where he left off by looking into the use of lethal force and hiring practices. 79% of the US police force is already certified in meeting the minimum standards that were set forward while he was governor. While these standards are good, we are going to look into creating additional standards as necessary.

The most important aspect of policing right now is in regards to the policing of mass protests. Right now, we're looking to improve that sort of response. When physical violence of property damage is seen, police will still be empowered to do what is necessary to prevent further issues.

We're creating a new office of officer recruitment in order to work on improving diversity in our police force. 

These are all things I can do myself but many aspects of police reform will require the input of the legislative branch. This is only the beginning of what we plan to do. 

The state has distributed over 30 million pieces of PPE since this crisis began. Our focus is on local distribution. Ohio's Bureau of Worker's Compensation has been distributing PPE to businesses throughout the state. Our state institutions receive a 30 day supply of PPE. 

The supply chain is our major focus in this crisis. We're looking into getting better and more long-term partnerships with PPE producers in order to ensure we do not run low on PPE again.

We continue to learn things everyday about COVID-19. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 will never have symptoms. There is an important distinction between these cases and presymptomatic cases, where the virus has not spread enough to cause symptoms but will. Recent news has shown that asymptomatic cases will see less spread than was originally thought. Presymptomatic cases will still cause spread and that means that we need to continue increasing the amount of information we give out regarding the symptoms. Please remember to focus on social distancing, as the contagion spreads most easily in close spaces. 

I hope we'll continue to learn new things about COVID-19 everyday and improve our response as well.

2:29 PM: Question Period begins

**What is your opinion of the defunding of police organizations?**

Governor: I think defunding the police is an absurd concept. We need them to protect us. We definitely need to reform the system currently in place that causes the issues we're seeing but that will not include defunding the police as far as I know.
____________________________________________________________________________________
2:32 PM: **Will you use your power as Governor to make police organizations more transparent regarding use of force and officer misconduct? Could this involve a centralized database?**

Governor: I definitely believe we need police organizations to become more transparent in order to prevent future officer misconduct. I will be speaking with leaders of police forces in order to do what I can. There are many legal hurdles however.
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:35 PM: **There are studies that show the the diversification of the police force will have no major effect on officer misconduct. What else do you plan to do out side of that?**

Governor: I think that police forces ought to reflect the diversity of their communities. I've spoken about my other plans at length I believe.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:36 PM: **At what point will state employees be heading back to work outside of the home?**

Governor: We're planning on having people work from home whenever we can. We're recommending that all business that can have their employees work from home to do so, and we will not be hypocritical in following those recommendations.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:38 PM: **With so many police agencies refusing to follow earlier guidelines, should there be penalties for police agencies that do not follow your new standards?**

Governor: I think our focus on transparency will be good enough for now. I do want to say that I highly recommend that police agencies follow our standards and communicate with us. We'll be more aggressive if we see any flagrant issues.
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:41 PM: **It's been a month since we began reopening and there hasn't been a major spike. Why do you believe that is, have you spoken with the experts?**

Governor: The amount of people a single case will infect had dropped dramatically until recently. I will have a more educated person speak more on this on Thursday most likely. The Dayton area is seeing the highest increases in infection rates per case. Keep in mind that this is a lagging indicator. We're focusing on layered protection and adding things slowly. This is a constant work in progress. 
________________________________________________________________________________________
2:45 PM: **Do you intend to ensure that the legislature will support your police reform? Governor Kasich was unable to do much in that area. Is there fear that police unions will lobby against you?**

Governor: I will work on this. I've worked with the police as attorney general and I believe that certification and licensing processes will be something that we can get people to support. Policing is a profession and it should be treated as such, much like a doctor. I believe we can find common ground. I only announced the things I can do myself. I hope that citizens and police will work together in their communities to get reform themselves, even as we focus on this at a state level.
___________________________________________________________
2:49 PM: **Is your team still working towards getting over 20,000 tests done every day? Is this need increasing based on the protests?**

Governor: I am very concerned about the risk of infection found in the protests. I've seen the pictures. People aren't wearing masks and aren't social distancing. COVID-19 is not over. You don't want to spread that, especially to our most vulnerable citizens. 
_______________________________________________________________________________
2:51 PM: **Some of our community leaders feel like they have been ignored and that had they been listened to, that many of these issues could have been solved earlier. Will you be more willing to listen?**

Governor: I certainly understand the frustration that many have been feeling but I don't believe that we need to start over from the beginning. I hope to look into earlier recommendations and institute the reforms that we believe will be workable. I think all of us, citizens and police officers, will be better off after these reforms. I will keep pushing on this issue and get things done.
_________________________________________________________________
2:55 PM: **Don't you think we should be moving beyond minimum standards at this point? Is the NAACP and Black Lives Matter involved in this process?**

Governor: By minimum standards, I meant best practices. I invite anyone to speak to our public safety office if they have recommendations for our reform process. We definitely want to work with everyone we can.
_________________________________________________________________________________
2:57 PM: Based on how many are beginning to feel that police agencies are overfunded, do you think that there should be a reevaluation of police budgets?

Governor: Those decisions are made largely at a local level. Those reviews must be made at a local level. However, I believe that we should have been reviewing these things constantly and I hope Ohioans will begin to do so now. Every citizen should be focusing on the budget of their cities. We need to keep the funding balanced between the things we care about the most. We always ought to have a right to discuss and make change regarding that subject.

I would like to address a situation regarding an Ohio National Guard member. He was removed from his post after the FBI found white supremacist posts on his social media. We had sent 100 members of our National Guard to Washington DC. While I support freedom of speech, if we cannot trust our National Guard members to treat everyone equally, they should not be interacting with members of any community in that role. Following due process, they may be removed from the Ohio National Guard entirely. We are working with the Ohio National Guard to create a procedure in order to ensure that this never happens again.

We're going to be talking in more detail in the coming week regarding our plans on how to address the disparities we've found regarding health, especially relating to COVID-19. We will also address police reform. I want to make tangible changes to the way police officers do their jobs, and the accreditation process required to become one. We have to be ever-vigilant to keep them accountable.

We're still working on expanding our testing regimen. We are now allowing retailers to test with expanded testing criteria. There are currently 40 retail testing centers throughout Ohio.

We're working in the nursing homes, where the most vulnerable people in our population reside in. We're certainly not the only ones involved in this process. There's a vetting process regarding which nursing homes are most at risk, and who in each nursing home is most at risk. At that point, National Guard personnel will enter the nursing home and perform the tests. Each member of these teams are at least capable of performing the role of an EMT but many go even farther. We will work hard to increase the number of tests given out, not only at nursing homes.

There are still a few categories of businesses that have not been allowed to reopen. This has all been done in phases. We wanted to be able to make this a layered process, with the areas we felt were higher risk coming later. At this point we're still not totally sure how some of these openings will affect our data. The virus has not gone away and that was the main thought process behind our decisions. We need to move forward with caution as we continue to monitor the situation. The goal is to make every facet of a reopening as safe as it can be. 

To anyone who says that we should reopen with no additional requirements, you have to understand that doing that would make absolutely no credible sense. Doing something like that would be irresponsible as a public servant of Ohio, and a dereliction of my duty as Governor. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""These are no ordinary times."" You have the right to do things that impact only you, however when you can affect our most vulnerable citizens, you have to be held to certain standards.

The trends are largely moving down or staying steady. 443,533 tests have been completed in total. 5,636 of those who tested positive were health-care workers. 

We have to be more intentional with all of our actions. Keeping your mask on, maintaining social distancing, keeping things disinfected. Always think before you go and plan ahead.

2:40 PM: Question period starts

**With an upcoming golf tournament being allowed to open, what special requirements did they meet that others did not?**

Governor: We have not gone through the plans of other tournaments yet so there is no specific reason that other tournaments will not be able to reopen. 
___________________________________________________________________________________
2:41 PM: **What is your feeling about Trump's recent decision to fire tear-gas and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters in order to stage what some call a simple photo-op?**

Governor: I don't know all the facts but I've certainly seen some things on TV. I will not criticize the actions of the president at every opportunity, in the same way I won't criticize our mayors in Ohio. What I can say is that I have attempted to keep our response in Ohio balanced in regards to allowing peaceful protests, while preventing chaos. My focus is on Ohio first, and I have to say that our mayors have done an excellent job, and that our police have done a very good job, although they have made mistakes. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:45 PM: **What do you think of racism being considered a public health crisis?**

Governor: Race and prejudice has historically and continues to impact that health of many Ohioans. This is seen in the data. What we are focused on is taking action to ensure that these disparities are reduced, if not removed.
___________________________________________________________________________________
2:47 PM: **As an official, what is the plan to keep us united in these trying times?** (Couldn't quite catch all of it but I think I summarized it well)

Governor: I believe that America has important ideals but like all things on Earth, it is important. You have to try your best. You have to find a way to keep American ideals alive. We need to keep our police accountable. We need to expose the fact that African-Americans and Latinos are suffering far worse than some other ethnicity. That should be shocking. That should make us mad. But our response ought to be efficient and fair.

2:51 PM: Question Period ends

2:51 PM: The Governor begins speaking

I've mentioned a few times about my grandparents and my father, who planted trees despite knowing they'd never be able to see it grow to its full potential. All Ohioans must plant the seeds of success for future generations, despite this great tragedy. I hope that we can plant the seeds that will cause our disparities to change into positivity. We're constantly learning as we struggle to keep going. We want to ensure that every Ohioan, no matter their race, color, ethnicity, or gender, will have the same opportunities for success.

I, along with my family, have personally planted a tree in the Governor's Grove. It represents Ohio's collective hope and resilience. I expect it will live for 300 years. I hope you have a great weekend, I'll be here again on Tuesday.

I need help applying for unemployment.  Basically, I temporarily lost my job because of the virus and I have been struggling with the system ever since. I went to the website to create an account and I was prompted to create a question to remember my pin.  As soon as I did that, the website freaked out and sent me to the home page.  I tried again and the Ohio unemployment website told me that I already had an account.  I have seen websites do this in the past, so I decided I should try and reset my pin.  It said something was wrong and that I needed to call their number.  I keep calling the number and I keep getting a message that something is wrong and they can't help me.  If anyone has any advice, I would very much appreciate it, thank you.|Ohio|2020|True|0

I’m sorry if this is not the right place for this thread, but I was at the KC Zoo around the holidays and noticed this elephant. Not sure who it is! I couldn’t find any staff at the time and when I looked online I couldn’t find anything definite. Mostly research lead me to Zuri having a virus. Other than that nothing. It’s funny actually this elephant has been in many background shots at the zoo in many videos and at least one news video online. 

But nothing at all! 

I know elephants get problems with their joints but I’m not an expert so that’s why I’m asking.

i had adopted a cat from diva pets about a month ago. we were told that the cat we got needed to be around other cats. immediately when we brought him home we noticed he had a little cough & would throw up randomly. we thought it was weird but assumed it was just nerves. we kept our animals separated to keep nerves at bay, with the occasional small meeting with food. over the course of a couple days we noticed everything about the cat we adopted was polar opposite to what were told. it seemed like she was describing a different cat. eventually one of our resident cats was starting to have issues breathing and keeping water and food down. then she became anorexic and would refuse water. we took her to the vet after a couple days and they recommended we do a 24 hour hospitalization to get fluids in her. once we got her to the hospital, she was diagnosed with a virus. then our other resident cat started to show symptoms as well. we kept them in a room separated from the rest of the home to keep them comfortable. our resident cat that got it immediately was rapidly declining and we needed to put her down. i say all of this because when we tried to reach out to the foster, our messages were not going through. she had many cats in her possession and we didn’t see any of them expect for one. when adopting a cat please do your research and met all the cats in the rescue/shelter. all of the other cats in her possession have been exposed to the virus. please be wary and keep your babies safe.|KansasCity|2024|True|0
"Healthcare professionals feel free to elaborate but my December has been hell & hope to save people some time & headache. My college kid brought pink eye & a virus home to us at Thanksgiving (pneumonia is insane on her college campus rn). First got on an antibiotic 12/4. Typical cold turned sinus infection. Once I finished augmentin the sore throat hell began all through Christmas. I had originally tested negative for flu/covid/strep early December. COVID neg again at Christmas. I have never had strep in my life and had convinced myself I had esophageal cancer - it was THAT bad 24/7. The sinus symptoms had gone away but just felt “off” in addition to the throat.

Thursday the wait at KUmed campus urgent care was an hour minimum and was told worse at other locations. They said everyone is sick right now. Left & tried a NextCare location Friday which was even more insane. Left & went back to KUmed main campus & lucked out getting right in. Sure enough the sore throat is walking pneumonia which I have never had. They said it is everywhere rn. Stay well KC & please continue to help others get treated & prevent the spread!"|KansasCity|2024|True|1

"Personal note:  My absolute go-to app is Radarscope.  It shows you storm and tornado tracks and isn't bloated with bullshit like weather channel and weather underground.  

Also, I've been negative on TV meteorologists in the past but when the tornadoes came through a few weeks ago in Florence, Jason Simpson on WHNT did an incredible job at identifying subtle locations.  He added more value than any app could.  

Stay safe from basically the earth today (virus, weather) and happy Easter.

**3:30 PM UPDATE**

SPC just issued Tornado Watch #109 for north & central AL + south-central TN until 10:00 pm.  It is NOT a PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) watch.

SPC wording in the watch calls for ""Several tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes likely.  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80 mph likely Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible""

Watch probability table indicates 80% chance of 2 or more tornadoes and 70% chance of 1 or more EF2+ tornadoes in the watch area.

Clusters of strong/severe cells (some tornado warned) getting ready to push into central AL from MS.  Other storms further north in northwestern AL not strong or severe at this time.

Warm front has not yet pushed north into north AL.  Will watch to see what it does.

Situation remains conducive for severe weather across the TN valley.  Stay weather alert!

**11 AM UPDATE:**

""All ingredients continue to come together for significant, widespread severe weather today across much of the southeastern US.

A PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) tornado watch was just issued for north & central MS, right up to the MS/AL state line.  SPC indicates 90% chance of two or more tornadoes, 80% chance of one or more EF2 or
higher tornadoes within the watch area.  You can guess who will be next for a tornado watch . . .

SPC did nudge their “moderate risk” area further north to near the TN/AL state line in their 8:00 am convective outlook.  Will watch closely to see how they may adjust the forecast in their 11:30 am update.

Will continue to monitor the northward progression of the warm front. That is likely the key to just how serious things will get this afternoon and evening.

Expect the TN valley to be under a tornado watch later today, perhaps as early as this afternoon.  Recommend attention to NWS forecast and local media forecast throughout the day today.

This remains an evolving situation, so the forecast could change either for better or worse.  Hopefully the worst of the severe weather will remain to our south & southwest.  However at this time, today looks likely to be a day where everyone will want to stay very weather alert.

""A significant, widespread severe weather potential will exist today (Sunday 04/12) across much of the  Southeastern US.  Areas most likely to see the worst of the severe weather include northern LA, most of MS, and north & central AL.  All surrounding areas (including AR/TN/GA and the FL panhandle) will have severe weather potential as well, perhaps not as concentrated as the areas mentioned above.""

**EARLY AM UPDATE**

Things still look as though there will be a good chance of widespread severe weather across north AL/south-central TN.  *All modes of severe weather continue to appear possible, including severe thunderstorms with damaging winds (60+ mph), large hail (1+”), flooding rainfall (2” – 3” with 3"" - 5"" possible in some areas), and tornadoes.  Some strong/violent long-track tornadoes may be possible as well.*

SPC still has NOT moved their “moderate risk” area any closer to the TN valley - right along the TN river.  While not exactly comforting, this does suggest that areas to our south and southwest will see the worst of the severe weather.  That does not mean that the TN valley will escape unscathed, just that we (hopefully) will not see things quite as bad as
they could be.

The real ""wild card"" in the scenario today is the warm front, currently to our south.  If it pushes through during the afternoon hours, then we will be in the warm air, highly sheared sector for much of the afternoon. This will give ample opportunity for severe storms and supercells to form.  As is usually the case, any cells that form out ahead of a line
of storms will likely be capable of the worst weather.

If on the other hand, the warm front delays its passage or stalls out completely south of the area, then our severe weather potential will be significantly diminished.  Expect scattered showers/thundershowers this morning.  If that persists into the afternoon hours & temperatures do not rise too much, then perhaps we will not see that much severe weather.
However if that warm front does push through and we get into that warm unstable air, well you can imagine the possibilities . . .

Expect the TN valley to be under a tornado watch later today, perhaps as early as this afternoon.  Recommend attention to NWS forecast and local media forecast throughout the day today.

*This remains an evolving situation*, so the forecast could change either for better or worse.  Hopefully the worst of the severe weather will remain to our south & southwest.  However at this time, today looks likely to be a day where everyone will want to stay very weather alert."""|HuntsvilleAlabama|2020|True|0

"This seems like an obvious idea, but so far I haven't encountered it personally. Basically, a voter obtains a blank ballot for their precinct and marks it before going to the polling location, where they cast the ballot. This avoids any concerns re mail-in voting and fraud. But in addition, it should drastically reduce the amount of time each voter spends inside the polling location, so that a.) the voter's risk of exposure is significantly reduced (depending of course on one's understanding of how the virus spreads) and b.) voters spend far less time waiting in line, despite the reduced number of locations.

The only reason I can think of why we couldn't do this is that it violates our election law, in which case I'd feel better were somebody to explain how and why.

"The [state dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ece0db09da4d4ca68252c3967aa1e9dd) (screenshot attached) has a nice bar graph that might allow some to more easily grok the trends than a color coded calendar.

For visualizing positive tests, which is considered by some to be a more leading indicator, [worldometer's](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/nebraska/) *Daily New Cases* chart is another good one to bookmark.  That same page also has a *Daily New Deaths* chart that could show if changes in advanced treatment are having real impact.

I love seeing all these numbers go down.

"I know this is crazy /s, don’t have these large gatherings. COVID numbers are crazy high! And guess what?? Masks work!! We have had 4 positive employees at work in the last 2 months Guess what? All were linked to family. None got it from work. Why? Masks, sanitizing, and social distancing. 

NO method is fool proof, yes you can still get it when all parties are wearing a mask but your odds are ALOT lower! 

This isn’t rocket science, most cases are being contact traced to family gatherings, bars, and restaurants. Why?? Because of prolong exposure without masks and without adequate distancing. 

You have to be cautious but this virus does not have legs and cannot get up and travel to your neighbors house. Mask wearing, limiting time around people, and always keeping atleast 6 feet are PROVEN to dramatically reduce spread. 

I’ve seen it at my own work place. Each person from my work who had it did not spread it to anyone else at work. Of course we may have gotten lucky but I believe masks and social distancing, as well as quick quarantine the moment symptoms arose made all the difference

EDIT: From one of my nurse friends working on the covid floor, all patients are currently 50+ and youngest she’s seen was 40. No this doesn’t mean if you’re under 40 you’re in the clear and certainly doesn’t negate your responsibility to those over 50. This virus is scary to many in their 20s and down right terrifying to many over 50! Be a good human, think of others, your night out at the bar can wait if it means possibly helping out a higher risk person!

"Wear a mask. It’s why healthcare workers wear masks. To fall in line?? What about when you can’t express your first amendment because of tear gas and pepper balls, isn’t that a better depiction of making people fall in line? 

I really struggle to understand this one. Is it like a slippery slope thing, where you are worried what’s next if you required to wear a mask? I mean, if you’re within 200 miles of a border, which equates to 2/3 of the country, the government can have check points and stop your car to see if there’s anyone undocumented in your car. About a decade ago, SCOTUS ruled that it was constitutional for an innocent person to be strip searched at the jail as part of getting arrested in a ticket mix up where the cop was looking at outdated data and mistakenly thought the guy had a warrant out for his arrest. And who can forget TSA who says they can naked body scan you and/or grab your genitals if you want to fly. There are way bigger liberty issues than wearing a mask to curb the spread. And scientists change as new facts and data comes out. Do you read a science book and say “huh I wonder what they thought 6 months before they figured this out? Must all be equally bad information I guess if they revised anything.” Aren’t you more worried about the government and foreign countries using data from fb and other places we store our info for nefarious purposes? I get the distrust of authority in general but man, there are way bigger fish to fry and I hear crickets outside of the mask stuff. 

Masks don’t hurt anyone, and it’s a fact it slows the spread. Doctors, experts and healthcare workers are begging us to wear them, so isn’t it possible the anti-mask movement is probably propaganda meant to divide us and keep the virus alive and well? If you wanted to cripple and divide a country so it fights itself from within, all while avoiding any blame, because you wanted to destabilize the US, what better way than what’s happening right now? People don’t even share the same facts. The way we are being systematically divided and the deaths were experiencing is more harmful than a bomb drop, especially because most people don’t even realize we’re under attack, and they’re defending the groups trying to divide us. The Cold War never ended, and we’re seeing the long game play out. The only way authoritarian countries can rise is not by doing better on their own, but by lowering their enemies to their already low level.

"&#x200B;

Dear Nebraskans,

I am a critical care physician taking care of COVID-19 patients in Omaha, NE.  I have been tracking the COVID situation in Nebraska very closely since February.  This letter explains our current situation and what we can do to improve it.

**Short version:  The COVID-19 outbreak in our state is extremely severe, and the only way we can improve this is for everyone to get very serious about social distancing.**

The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska is gravely concerning.  The 7-day rolling averages are very bad and getting worse.  Nebraska has 641 new cases per million per day.  Douglas County has 548 new cases per million per day.  These are among the worst rates of new cases in the United States.  Every week, our county and our state set new records for new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.  All parts of the state, and indeed the entire region, are in a similar situation.  

A large rise in case counts is always followed a few weeks later by a large rise in deaths caused by COVID.  Nebraska is starting to experience this reality, and the trends indicate that the situation will get much worse in the weeks to come.  In September and early October, the number of deaths in Nebraska was fairly steady at about 25 per week.  Two weeks ago this spiked to 44.  Last week Nebraska had 55 deaths.  This upward trend will continue.

Nebraska has 698 COVID-positive people in the hospital – exactly one month ago we had 271 (a record at that time).  The Omaha Metro has 303 COVID-positive inpatients – exactly one month ago we had 125. These numbers rise every day.  Hospitals in Omaha and throughout Nebraska can and will fill up without a drastic change in the trends.  Operating hospitals above normal capacity impacts the care of all conditions, not just COVID-19.  When ICUs are full, there are no beds for the next victim of an asthma attack, stroke or heart attack.  And when these patients are stuck in crowded emergency departments, the ability to deliver optimal care is hampered.

Many people have noted the low case fatality rate in Nebraska.  One of the main reasons for this low case fatality rate is the fact that while our hospitals have been under strain, they have never been overwhelmed.  If Nebraska’s hospitals become overwhelmed, the case fatality rate will go up swiftly.  We know this from analyzing the fatality rates in other parts of the United States and the world.  

While we have made progress in understanding how to best treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19, this progress is only applicable in the event that we maintain adequate capacity to care for sick patients.  In response to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, hospital leaders are implementing plans to increase capacity throughout the state.  These plans are necessary, but having physical space for patients does not solve the problem.  Temporary traveling healthcare workers will help to provide care in these additional spaces, but these workers are not unlimited in number.  Hospitals all over the United States are hiring them to address the same conundrum.

You may have read that hospitals in Nebraska have ample capacity to handle a large increase in new cases.  I disagree with this statement.  Here is how you can find out for yourself.  Ask a physician, a nurse, and/or a respiratory therapist who works in one of the largest hospitals in your area, “How are you doing in terms of census and capacity?  Do you think your hospital can handle a large increase in COVID admissions?”  I know how they will answer because I ask colleagues these questions regularly.

**The best way to limit the devastating effects of this COVID-19 surge is to interrupt the transmission of the virus.  Reducing the number of new cases will require a dramatic change in behavior.**  We have learned from other nations how to keep transmission rates low.  In order to prevent many unnecessary deaths, we need to dramatically change the way we are conducting our lives.  The actions are very simple.  We must avoid crowded places, closed spaces (especially with poor ventilation), and close contact with non-household members.  We must avoid the “Three C’s” all of the time.  We must wear our masks, watch our distance, and wash/sanitize our hands.  We must do the “Three W’s” all of the time outside of our own homes.  We need to stop gathering.

I will define “gathering” as:  people spending time together, indoors, with people from outside their own household, for non-essential activities.  When people gather, they (1) put themselves at risk for contracting the virus, and (2) risk passing the virus to others.  Put bluntly, when people gather they contribute to the outbreak.

Here are some examples of gatherings that are contributing to the spread of the virus:

\-	Multiple (more than one) families getting together indoors for meals or parties

\-	Dining inside of a restaurant, especially if it is crowded

\-	Spending time inside a bar, especially if it is crowded

\-	Indoor group sports.  Example:  playing basketball indoors with non-household members is a perfect mechanism for spreading the virus.

\-	Working out at a gym, especially if crowded

\-	Attending events with non-household members.  Example:  attending a crowded wedding reception, particularly indoors and without masks, is a perfect way to contract and transmit the virus.

While avoiding some of these gatherings might sound drastic, these sacrifices are mild compared with the suffering and deaths our state will experience without a change in behaviors.  Many people say that they have a “bubble” which consists of multiple families whom they trust because of their excellent social distancing.  Gathering with multiple people from outside your own household is the opposite of social distancing.  Such gatherings are contributing to the increased cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

If you and your family have eased up on your social distancing, as most people have, now is the time to revert back to how you did it in April.  Every time you forego a group gathering, know that you are saving a Nebraskan’s life.  Yes, it is that dire.

Please keep in mind that asymptomatic spread is extremely common.  This means that ANY person, even without any signs of illness, can transmit the disease to you and your family members.  This is why we must maintain distance between ourselves and non-household members all of the time.

Children get infected and transmit the virus – there is undeniable scientific evidence for this now.  Thankfully, few children get very sick.  Still, when asymptomatic children are not socially distanced, they spread the virus to other children, who eventually transmit the virus to vulnerable people (of all ages).  Those vulnerable people are at the highest risk for severe disease or death.

Herd immunity without a vaccine is not possible.  If the United States tries to pursue herd immunity without a vaccine, millions of Americans will die from COVID.  This is not acceptable.

Masks help to prevent spread, but they are not magical.  Being outdoors reduces risk, but this is not magical either.  Yes, wear a mask.  Yes, do things outdoors instead of indoors.  Still, the best way to eliminate risk is to not be near other people for non-essential activities.

People in our communities have a choice right now.  We can continue on the current trajectory, which will be catastrophic, or we can choose to engage in real social distancing and save hundreds if not thousands of Nebraskans’ lives.  The sooner we get this outbreak under control, the sooner we can get back to a more normal way of life.

"Unfortunately, after more than two years, I tested positive for COVID with antigen test today. My symptoms are considered mild but nonetheless I went to urgent care center to seek treatment. However, Patient First doesn’t treat COVID and doesn’t prescribe Pfizer pills. Went to another urgent care center that does prescribe Pfizer pills, but with impossible conditions to be eligible, i.e. unless you are terminally ill. 

This is so freaking different from what the CDC and State Health Department have said about the experience and expectations. The drug is not in back order by any sense anymore so why the doctors and clinics are so adamantly refusing to prescribe it? I made an appointment with CVS Minute Clinic on Monday but I have no idea if they would do anything, despite they say they offer COVID treatment option. 

For anyone who has gotten the Pfizer pills, it’s greatly appreciated if you can disclose where and how you got them. Thanks."|Maryland|2022|True|1
"Evening all!

This week I cut my vacation in hot springs short after my hotel room was entered/scoped and we discovered the was valet driving our car- all this for the privilege of paying over $300 per night on bathhouse row.

I'm greatly conflicted because of all the potential I saw in Hot Springs: along with the beauty it seems the place is soured by an unsavory underbelly. I've heard, and certainly believe, there's a meth problem (no place is immune, I get it), but it seems to me there's much more to the story then that and I'm curious to learn more about what's preventing Hot Springs from thriving.

I couldn't help but notice the large number of derelict/abandoned buildings (with the medical arts building standing foremost in my mind), and this implies a bigger story. What role does the local and state government have to play in all this? What is it that's keeping investors away? Are there any particular entities (be in government or business) that are benefiting from suppressing economic development? Or is it the local population themselves (as gentrification isn't good news for everyone) standing in the way? Is the crime problem part of the problem or a symptom of a different issue?"|arkansas|2021|True|0

✨be me, moved from NYC to KC 7 years ago

✨allergies? sure, heard of em. stuffy nose once a year for a week, bada bing bada boom

✨people complain about severe allergies in KC over the years, thank goodness that ain't me

✨come back from a catering event Monday night

✨the fastest wave of starting to feel symptoms ever: sore throat, stuffy nose, extreme body/headache, feeling hot and cold, extreme fatigue 

✨i deteriorated FAST. bedridden and huge efforts to move around and talk the next day. I've had COVID before and this is almost worse 

✨yay the walk-in clinic has a spot at 4pm! i can barely drag myself to the bus to get there

✨tests: strep is negative, COVID is negative, flu is negative, perfect temperature even tho i feel heavy-headed and so warm. my throat is indeed swollen though.

✨doctor: ok I'm gonna send you home with allergy pills and nose spray. the fluids from your stuffy nose drain into your throat and cause the soreness/swollenness.

✨me: ....you mean to tell me ..ALLERGIES kicked my ass this hard?? they can do that?? is this what allergy life is for other ppl??

✨doctor: yep! we have the absolute worst allergens around here. welcome to the Midwest.

"I know this is crazy /s, don’t have these large gatherings. COVID numbers are crazy high! And guess what?? Masks work!! We have had 4 positive employees at work in the last 2 months Guess what? All were linked to family. None got it from work. Why? Masks, sanitizing, and social distancing. 

NO method is fool proof, yes you can still get it when all parties are wearing a mask but your odds are ALOT lower! 

This isn’t rocket science, most cases are being contact traced to family gatherings, bars, and restaurants. Why?? Because of prolong exposure without masks and without adequate distancing. 

You have to be cautious but this virus does not have legs and cannot get up and travel to your neighbors house. Mask wearing, limiting time around people, and always keeping atleast 6 feet are PROVEN to dramatically reduce spread. 

I’ve seen it at my own work place. Each person from my work who had it did not spread it to anyone else at work. Of course we may have gotten lucky but I believe masks and social distancing, as well as quick quarantine the moment symptoms arose made all the difference

EDIT: From one of my nurse friends working on the covid floor, all patients are currently 50+ and youngest she’s seen was 40. No this doesn’t mean if you’re under 40 you’re in the clear and certainly doesn’t negate your responsibility to those over 50. This virus is scary to many in their 20s and down right terrifying to many over 50! Be a good human, think of others, your night out at the bar can wait if it means possibly helping out a higher risk person! If we are lucky we will be over 50 one day and I’m damn sure we wouldn’t want some 20 something spreading the next plague to us because they’re not worried about it. 

Also it seems many over 50 are the least concerned about it. Just crazy to me. I have told my mom we are NOT going to thanksgiving this year. She said there’s nothing to worry about you’re buying into the panic. I’m thinking come on my risk is LOW for this virus and I’m taking it seriously, you’re damn near 60 and not in perfect health, how are you not being cautious!"|Omaha|2020|True|1
"Hey there Denver,

I would actually like a bit of advice regarding my current employment situation. I moved to Colorado within the last half of a year and got a job at a restaurant chain and was self quarantined due to family showing many symptoms of covid 19 and now I believe I have it as well. The restaurant is still open due to the carry out and delivery options they offer. The corporate office has emphasized with voluntary quarantine however offers no benefits to employees unless you have proof that you have contracted the virus yourself (not including family members). I am currently awaiting the test results and have filed for unemployment due to not working for nearly two weeks now but won't be able to take advantage of that until the end of April (I'm assuming due to high volume of people applying). I have contacted my direct manager and was basically brushed off like I was just leaving to get out of work and the manager made it seem like me being such a burden was not worth the time or effort to deal with and it was impliedthat my job may not be there when I am fit to work again. Do you all have any advice for me regarding this?"|Denver|2020|True|1
"I am a pharmacy technician, and I have been feeling slightly off this last weekend. I finally had a day off on Saturday and slept all day which is highly unlikely me.

Now I’m beginning to feel feverish and I’m experiencing horrible body pains and shortness of breath. I’m aware that these are all serious symptoms and that I work in health care and need to take care of myself. 

My employer requires a doctor’s note in order for me to receive sick pay. I’m in my early 20s, new to Colorado, and do not have insurance yet from my current employer. I don’t have a recent PCP because my normal PCP was under my university, and I graduated so I no longer can receive care from them.

"I work at a mall in the area and my store is one of the only ones still open despite it not being an essential business whatsoever. A few days ago I developed a cough and some cold like symptoms and decided to go home. Today was my next scheduled day and things haven’t gotten any better for me so I decided to call in again. I couldn’t help but sense some frustration from the manager. 

Now I’m feeling guilty but I don’t think I should have to feel this way. I’m not going because I care about myself and my coworkers and don’t want to get anyone sick ( I work with a lot of older people and if I were to have a virus it could potentially kill them). I don’t feel good about taking that risk at all. I also don’t have health insurance. I’m sure everyone is aware of the current situation but I’m just looking for some support. 

I don’t think it’s fair to me or my coworkers that I even have to make that decision. I could potentially be putting everyone at risk but it seems like no one cares about that at all. All similar stores have been shut down for a week or more at this point and have given their employees paid leave. I’m not looking for a handout, and based on every other similar store’s response to this situation, it doesn’t seem right that we’re still open. I don’t think my company can afford to do anything for their employees so that’s where I’m at. 

Am I making the right decision? I mean, is that even a question I need to ask? It just sucks because it seems like this isn’t being taken seriously at all by my employer. I don’t want to put anyone at risk and I constantly hear that I should be staying at home if I’m sick. I don’t want to lose my job over this but I don’t feel comfortable being around that many other people. Is anyone else in a similar situation? What are you doing about it?

Update: We shut down after the statewide order. I’m not receiving anything from the company but I will be ok financially. They really hung us out to dry lol. Thanks for all your support and helpful perspectives!"|Denver|2020|True|1

"If anyone here has been tested yet can you please share your experience? 

I believe I need to be tested and since everything is a shit show I was looking to see if anyone had any experiences yet that they could share.

I know most people won’t qualify to be tested (especially since the new testing guidelines go into effect today) but after reading the CDHPE website I believe I do. I work in a Dental office in South Denver, I work in the mouths of 10-15 patients a day. Lots of our patients are elderly so if I have it we need to know so the office can shut down and contact all patients I’ve been in contact with the last week. 

I’m just trying to get a picture of what I’m in for if I go over to that drive in test lab. I also read that some private providers will be able to test starting today, but I didn’t know any info on who/where those other providers are.

Edit: Yes I am aware I can’t just drive over, I’m waiting for my PCP to open.

Edit2: Spoke with my PCP, she said they’ve been told that there won’t be anymore testing done on the general public. That only those hospitalized will be given tests, since they’re so short on them.

"This morning on the way to work I was listening to a country station from northern CO. One of the DJs starts talking about a lecture that experts gave at Harvard about the coronavirus. 

He starts off by saying that he is just some dumb guy from CSU so who is he to question the experts? Well... exactly. You aren't an expert. Normally I don't agree with the stay in your lane argument because everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in the case of a public health emergency, if you don't know what you are talking about then you should just shut the hell up. Giving out misleading or wrong information can get people killed.

Then he starts his rant on the main points that the experts made. The first being that the US health care system was not well prepared for this. However he knows people in the county health department and they have been working for months on this so they are prepared. Does he also know that it took over a month longer for the CDC to developed a test for coronavirus than most of the world? That one of the reasons that the number of reported cases is so low in the US is because they couldn't test for it? Just because they knew about it and were making plans does not mean that the US was as prepared as they should have been.

The second point the experts made was that it is no longer possible to prevent the virus from coming here and that trying to contain should be the priority. He actually agreed with the fact that it was already here, but then went on about how we don't need to close down schools or anything yet. That is the same policy that has been taken in countries like Italy. The problem is that people become sick and contagious before they really start showing symptoms or getting checked. That is why it is spreading so fast. Waiting until 1 person is diagnosed before reacting means that now a group of people are infected with it instead of just 1 person.

There were other things he went on about, but at this point I couldn't believe someone could be this ignorant and speak with such authority to such a large audience. His cohost was just agreeing with every thing he said and adding to his authority. She didn't offer a single counter point or try and add any balance to it. She was just a yes man. If you aren't an expert in communicable diseases then just shut up and let the experts talk. Spreading misinformation is bad enough, but contradicting experts and making fun of them because they are speaking at a prestigious university is just dangerous. This is why anti-vaxxers exist.

"**THE TL;DR STORY**     
In particular, I’m looking for someone with experience in this area to resolve what would most likely be a motherboard issue with the console. I’m guessing it needs what’s called a “Reflow of the board” or “Re-Balling”. It’s showing symptoms of the Yellow Light Of Death’ (YLOD). I prefer someone who takes emails so I can share a detailed report of the issue before they offer me a quote. Appreciate any recommendations in advanced!

**BACKSTORY**     
Happened over a month ago that my PS3 stopped working. I did a web search and found Beetronix Solutions in NSW does these repairs. On their website here (https://www.beetronix.com.au/gaming-consoles/ps3-ylod.html) it says they stopped offering repairs for this type of issue, *however*, when I called them up a guy told me they still do those repairs for over $200.

The problem is… I emailed Beetronix Solutions with a detailed report into my issue and asked for a written quote. They didn’t respond. The guy I spoke with over the phone (same guy who told me the price and that they can fix it) had a shit awful phone manner and flat out told me they are too busy to answer emails! It’s this reason why I’m heavily reluctant to pack my console and ship it to a different state… I don’t want to do that to be later told either:

**a)** It actually cannot be fixed, or that service isn’t offered.     
**b)** End up charging me something else besides what was verbally said over the phone or what is listed on the website (the website is pretty simple so the information might be out of date).

"Hi, fellow Melbournians,

Not sure if this is the right place to post this. Please be gentle with me, and redirect me to a more appropriate sub if you know of one. Also, I’d like to apologise in advance for the infodump.

I am a 29-year-old cis woman based in the eastern suburbs. I’ve struggled with mental illness for most of my life, but I have been consistently misdiagnosed since I was a teenager. Finally, at age 26, after being assessed by a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist, my former diagnoses of BPD and BPII were revoked, and I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, as well as MDD and GAD.

Like a lot of other women who are diagnosed with ADHD as adults, it quickly became apparent once I started taking stimulants that I also have ASD, but my ADHD symptoms had been masking it all along.

This last year has been a rollercoaster for me in terms of figuring out my identity, not only as a neurodivergent person, but in terms of my sexuality and relationship style—I finally came out as pansexual, and I discovered that I am polyam. Getting to know the real me has been a deeply liberating experience, but it has also been exhausting, and, over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been struggling badly with autistic burnout. I have been exhausted, and extremely emotionally dysregulated.

I have been seeing an excellent clinical psychologist over the last five years who specialises in ACT/schema therapy, which has been immensely helpful, particularly in relation to processing my childhood trauma (I grew up in an abusive household). Nevertheless, it’s becoming increasingly clear to me that my current psychologist is not equipped to counsel somebody with complex neurodivergence, nor somebody on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum who has multiple partners. This isn’t a criticism of her as a person, or as a mental health practitioner—it’s just that she is a straight, monogamous, allistic person, and I am struggling more and more to relate to her.

Which brings me to my question. I am looking for a neurodiversity-affirming psychologist, preferably one who specialises in ASD/ADHD, and who has experience working with queer/polyam people. I would prefer somebody who has lived experience in these areas, but it’s not mandatory. I’m wondering if any of you wonderful people would be able to recommend somebody in the greater Melbourne area who fits these criterium? I understand that what I’m looking for is quite niche, so I’m happy to travel, if necessary.

I saw the Austin few times and their follow up with my GP and level of care was honestly horrible, and they were prepared to diagnose me without ever giving me a single Holter Monitor test or other actual diagnostic test at all. They also prescribed me a medication that made me really sick and my follow up appointment after being prescribed the medication just never happened on the scheduled day. Not to mention the second Holter monitor test I had through the clinic Dr Chris practices through took months to send anything at all to my GP, although I didn't see him directly. 


I tried to see someone privately last year only to receive a voicemail from their receptionist that due to demand they were ""no longer seeing POTS patients"" despite having some atypical symptoms that might be something else. I require an assessment and letter from a cardiologist specifically to send to VicRoads to get clearance to get a learner's permit.

"I am absolutely desperate to find a doctor that can help me with my issues in Melbourne or Australia in general. I have suffered from stomache issues and allergies my entire life. In 2023 I decided to go on a restrictive diet to find out exactly what I was allergic to. Ends up I cant eat ANYTHING and all my symptoms got WORSE. 

I have eaten Steak and Potato every day, 2 to 3 times a day for over a year and anything i introduce gives me a reaction ranging from constipation or upset stomache but the worst is getting close to anaphalactic 'hayfever' like symptoms. 

These 'hayfever' symptoms are getting worse to the point of anaphalxys, my last reaction had me struggling to breathe and my eyes puffy. This is from anything containing histamine. Worst reactions happened when i ate smoked aged Pork or citrus (lemon). The symptoms are being close to life threatening and without an epipen or allergy plan I could face a deadly attack. 

I have asked for a referal from my doctor 4 times now to see an allergy specialist and some of these places wouldnt take me, didnt do digestion related problems and the doctor doesnt know who can help me.

I rang monash health, they never returned my call. Epworth isnt taking adult patients. Most places only do skin testing. Ive previously seen gastroenterologists who couldnt help. 

I saw a dietician who helped with suppliments and I feel better at the moment but still remain on a restrictive diet.

"Evening all!

This week I cut my vacation in hot springs short after my hotel room was entered/scoped and we discovered the was valet driving our car- all this for the privilege of paying over $300 per night on bathhouse row.

I'm greatly conflicted because of all the potential I saw in Hot Springs: along with the beauty it seems the place is soured by an unsavory underbelly. I've heard, and certainly believe, there's a meth problem (no place is immune, I get it), but it seems to me there's much more to the story then that and I'm curious to learn more about what's preventing Hot Springs from thriving.

I couldn't help but notice the large number of derelict/abandoned buildings (with the medical arts building standing foremost in my mind), and this implies a bigger story. What role does the local and state government have to play in all this? What is it that's keeping investors away? Are there any particular entities (be in government or business) that are benefiting from suppressing economic development? Or is it the local population themselves (as gentrification isn't good news for everyone) standing in the way? Is the crime problem part of the problem or a symptom of a different issue?"|arkansas|2021|True|0

"2 months ago, I went on vacation to Brevard County, Florida for 6 days. Now, one of my favorite Floridian activities is bird watching, and sandhill cranes are my all-time favorite Floridian bird. However, the entire 6 days I was in Florida, I only saw 5 sandhill cranes. My dad saw another one at a golf course, but I wasn't with him. There are hundreds of sandhill cranes in Brevard County, so I don't get it! Why did I have such a hard time finding them? Every other trip i've taken to Florida, I saw way more of them. Don't get me wrong. I'm grateful to have seen any at all. I would've gone home incredibly disappointed if I didn't see any at all.

The Floridian bird I saw the most of during my trip was definitely ibises, which is another one of my favorites. I saw at least 100 of those! I also saw lots of egrets, herons and even pelicans. I'm just confused on where all the sandhill cranes were when I was there! Where were they? I had really looked forward to seeing sandhill cranes! Was it because I went during bird flu season? Maybe it being bird flu season had something to do with it."|Florida|2022|True|0
"Exalted Governor,

I’m a proud lifelong resident of Ohio. Until thirteen months ago I was happy living, working, playing, and volunteering here. Ohio is my home.

Today I saw news that you are considering shifting the metric for lifting restrictions from Covid cases to Covid vaccines administered. 

I will forgo the obvious criticisms:

* Of moving the goalposts for the hundredth time; 
* Of hysterically fearing a single risk, while increasing myriad other risks trying to fight it;
* Of fixating on the short-term for some Ohioans instead of the long-term for all Ohioans; 
* Of assuming we want or need your permission to live our lives;
* Of implicitly claiming ownership of our bodies;
* Of assuming we are too stupid to see any of this;

No, today I’m writing to you as a man who has reached his limit. For over a year I watched silently as you caved to the demands of petty authoritarians. What you fail to understand is that you are exercising power you do not rightfully possess. You and Dr. Acton were happy to assume the mantle of omnipotent protectors – as long as the only threat was a virus not so different from the cold or flu. 

How did you fight this enemy? By declaring overnight that many of our rights must be suspended indefinitely. Rights that have conditions are not rights, but privileges. Somehow you retain the audacity to hold Ohio hostage until we capitulate to more of your ever-escalating demands? 

If you move forward with this absurd ultimatum, I will leave Ohio by the end of 2021, permanently. I will never again live or work here, and when I visit I’ll try my best to spend as little time and money here as possible. 

We see the sleight of hand you are attempting. First, you verbally encourage use of these experimental vaccines while offering no tangible incentives to recipients. No respite from mask mandates, social distancing, or lockdowns. Then, you act surprised that “not enough” people are getting the shot.  Finally, you declare that we just might have our lives back – if only we reach one last arbitrary benchmark. 

We see how desperately you cling to emergency powers, choosing which metrics to use so the emergency can never officially end.

Governor, I wish you will experience in your remaining years a mere fraction of that which you have thrust upon my statesmen and me. I wish you will feel the isolation, the dullness, the confusion, the hopelessness, the resentment. I wish you come to understand that you willingly traded Ohio’s physical, emotional, spiritual, and financial health for the promise of saving a few lives which were close to their end anyway.  I wish you realize the juice was not worth the squeeze. That you did a thousand times more harm to us than if you had done nothing at all.

I wish you live to see that history will be cruel to the petty tyrants of 2020 such as yourself.

It’s not all bad though, Mike. You have at least one thing to look forward to. When you pass on to the next life, you won’t have to endure any more bitter Midwest winters. 

You’ll be where it’s always warm."|Ohio|2021|True|0
"Hello all,

Does Anyone have info on this year's flu/ stomach flu around Indy?

 Sons daycare has been hit with flu symptoms that seem to be severe for about 12 hours and then gone, no fever. Daughters school has also been hit (against small window, no fever). 

Now my wife has it, no fever, just puking. Almost like a food poisoning or ""stomach flu"".

Symptoms appear to literally be just puke, then gone. No body aches, no sniffles. No temp. No bathroom issues, just vomit it seems and maybe tiredness.

"So I just had the most awkward encounter with my local pharmacist. Woke up with a sore throat and a bit lethargic. Went to get some codral original. They took my licence, punched it in and said 'we can't sell you that because you bought it yesterday'. 'no I didnt'. 'we can see it on the register. You used your licence to buy it yesterday.'

The last time I bought codral or equivalent would be at least 6months ago, probably more like a year. I told them there was an error and I think this is identity theft, but they just kept saying 'sorry we can't sell it to you.' I was like 'no no, I don't care about the codral, I care that someone has used my licence number to buy this'. 

It was really awful. I was there wondering what to do about identity theft and they were looking at me like I was a junky trying to convince them to give me a few pills. 

Anyway, I have called the police, they want me to come in for a statement, but they said I  can't do it until I don't have 'cold and flu symptoms'. Can't do it over the phone or internet. Could be days later.

Any advice appreciated. Am I at risk of other things from stolen licence info? I travelled for work yesterday, so have flights and purchases that prove I was in a certain location, which is unlikely to be wherever the purchase was made. I just can't fathom why it is so hard for the police to just take a statement over the phone or at least start something, especially given the whole covid situation."|sydney|2021|True|0

"I’m not a conspirator and this post isn’t partisan. 

I’m looking at current trends in covid cases and as of this morning (8/17/21) the current 7 day average rate of new cases in NJ is 1537.

New York’s current 7 day average is 4,554.5 

Last year at this same week, the average for New Jersey was 270.5. And the average for New York was 609. 

Both states, and the entire country, saw a steady increase in new cases and deaths continuing into late October of 2020 and then a huge increase was reported through winter peaking around January 5th for NJ with that week averaging 12,966 new cases, and 16,611 new cases averaged in NY.

What I’m saying is that we are averaging much higher rates of new infections than this time last year and we’re again about to enter cold and flu season where in new cases and deaths will undeniably rise. Are we to expect higher infection and death rates this season than last year? 

I looked at death rates too. Currently NJ’s weekly average is 7 deaths. NY is 18. This time last year NJ reported 0 deaths, but that number rose quickly in Fall. New York’s weekly death average as reported on 8/18/20 was 3, and that number rose as well.

Our numbers are higher than they were last year and so I’m wondering if we’re headed for an even worse flu season this year.

"I just telephoned Optimal Pharmacy+ Jamison to make an appointment to receive an influenza vaccine. I have a medical condition that renders me eligible to receive this free of charge under the National Immunisation Program (NIP). 

The pharmacist told me it would still cost me $25.00 despite the Government and the Pharmacy Guild saying it is free - see below. She said that pharmacies do not participate in the NIP and so could charge an ""administration"" fee. 

If pharmacies are going to charge a fee, even for those eligible for the NIP, then the pharmacy should say so up front and the Guild should be clear about this on its www site. Or is this pharmacy running a scam?

I tried emailing and phoning the pharmacy Guild to clarify, but they are a very elusive bunch. However, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia states, ""If you're eligible, you can get the influenza vaccine for free under the National Immunisation Program (NIP)."".

"The United States, and especially states like Florida, have done awfully bad in the pandemic, mostly for a reason: lack of cooperation.

Nobody knows how long this pandemic could last. The virus may stay with us permanently and vaccine trials may fail continuously, and living like we are doing now may last the entire new decade. So changes to how we live are unavoidable and if you don’t understand that then it is going to eventually hit you, being you or a close one who fall to the potentially deadly disease.

You need to wear your face mask. Studies are clear. Places where people use it in public keep hospitalizations rates stable. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT- keeping hospitals with sufficient beds and ICU’s, and especially ventilators, since Covid-19 is not the only disease and the are still deadlier diseases out there. Understand that you may be feeling alright but can still be carrying the virus. When you breathe freely you exhale the airborne virus. IT IS AN AIRBORNE VIRUS even if the WHO hesitates to accept it. Whenever you are with another person or group of people that DO NOT LIVE WITH YOU, you NEED to wear it. This includes your friends, extended family, neighbors, coworkers. No exceptions and no excuses. Use an effective lightweight mask if you have to use it for a while. This means that you need to get away from others and do things via phone, internet, video calls or whatever for extended periods of conversation with others. 

You need to stay away, 6 ft or more. The more the better. Especially in places like the beach. No sure if this is the best time to go with friends out since a distance of 6 ft and the use of mask would be ideal in this situation, but if you feel an uncontrollable need to hang out with friends please keep a distance between each other.

Do things as much as possible outdoors. A/C recirculates the air and thus, the virus. Why are people being infected in the middle of the hot summer? Because first the virus needs a temperature of 133 F to completely disintegrate instantaneously so it has plenty of time to get to you if you are 6 inches from another person without a mask and second because most people are getting infected indoors at bars, bowling alleys, restaurants and the such where the temperature is comfortable for the virus to hang and recirculate until it reaches you face openings. Therefore avoid unnecessary indoor activities and businesses should change their model to outdoor, open spaces and avoid walled areas.

Closure and an order to stay at home are the other option which is not economically viable.

The pandemic does not seem to be getting over anytime soon. And flu season approaches so it will be really bad soon if you insist on wanting to go back to the old times. The old times are over. Face it and make the necessary changes so you don’t end up dead, killing a loved one, or having to go to bankruptcy or losing your home because of the millionaire debt you will owe the hospital."|Florida|2020|True|0

And before I start getting down-voted, and people reply with silly arguments about death rates, and odds and this and that.

Ask yourself if you can afford a two week hospital stay and countless follow up medical bills if you're lucky enough to only require to be treated and not be placed on a ventilator. 

Don't be an idiot and gamble on a slim chance of somehow being asymptomatic. 

Wear a mask when you do go outside, but do not be fooled into thinking that makes you safe to do as you please. You're merely lowering the chances of passing it on to someone else. 

Our government has shown us that it cannot be relied to protect us in this crisis. It is on US. 

A haircut isn't worth continued spread, hospitalization, or even death whether to you or someone you love, or even a stranger. 

A drink at a bar isn't worth it.

A theme park isn't worth it.

A meal at a restaurant isn't worth it. 

Seeing your friends isn't worth it. 

Visiting your elderly parents or grandparents right now ISN'T WORTH IT. 

&#x200B;

Quite frankly reopening our economy at the cost of unnecessary human suffering has proven to not be worth it. 

We're right back where we started people, and for what? Are any of you better off or in better shape to weather this wave or the next? 

As a business owner are you ready to shut down again because we rushed to reopen, instead of demanding our government get its shit together and focus on small business and regular folk instead of Fortune 500 corporations?

If you're not ready to shut down now, are you ready to shut down in the fall when we run into the Flu and people potentially getting hit with both viruses at once?

What happens when all the government aid expires in July for those who need it the most? 

Get your head out of the sand, you can't ignore this just like you can't ignore a category 5 hurricane smacking into the state. 

Which by the way, please have a plan ready should you need to evacuate and be met with other states mandating you be quarantined because our state failed to get it's shit together before we opened.

You need to wear your face mask. Studies are clear. Places where people use it in public keep hospitalizations rates stable. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT- keeping hospitals with sufficient beds and ICU’s, and especially ventilators, since Covid-19 is not the only disease and the are still deadlier diseases out there. Understand that you may be feeling alright but can still be carrying the virus. When you breathe freely you exhale the airborne virus. IT IS AN AIRBORNE VIRUS even if the WHO hesitates to accept it. Whenever you are with another person or group of people that DO NOT LIVE WITH YOU, you NEED to wear it. This includes your friends, extended family, neighbors, coworkers. No exceptions and no excuses. Use an effective lightweight mask if you have to use it for a while. This means that you need to get away from others and do things via phone, internet, video calls or whatever for extended periods of conversation with others. 

You need to stay away, 6 ft or more. The more the better. Especially in places like the beach. No sure if this is the best time to go with friends out since a distance of 6 ft and the use of mask would be ideal in this situation, but if you feel an uncontrollable need to hang out with friends please keep a distance between each other.

Do things as much as possible outdoors. A/C recirculates the air and thus, the virus. Why are people being infected in the middle of the hot summer? Because first the virus needs a temperature of 133 F to completely disintegrate instantaneously so it has plenty of time to get to you if you are 6 inches from another person without a mask and second because most people are getting infected indoors at bars, bowling alleys, restaurants and the such where the temperature is comfortable for the virus to hang and recirculate until it reaches you face openings. Therefore avoid unnecessary indoor activities and businesses should change their model to outdoor, open spaces and avoid walled areas.

Closure and an order to stay at home are the other option which is not economically viable.

The pandemic does not seem to be getting over anytime soon. And flu season approaches so it will be really bad soon if you insist on wanting to go back to the old times. The old times are over. Face it and make the necessary changes so you don’t end up dead, killing a loved one, or having to go to bankruptcy or losing your home because of the millionaire debt you will owe the hospital."|Florida|2020|True|0

Hi! I’m not new to the PNW so born and raised and shaped by the chronic mold and dampness up here lol but I did just move into an older building (early 1900s) that isn’t well maintained and have been super ill ever since.

Then, as I was house sitting this week, I noticed the cough cleared up. Now I’m back home, full of goo, and noticing my cat has been coughing as well!

From the most read newspaper in Florida. USE PRIVATE WINDOW OR INCOGNITO TO READ IF A PROBLEM

Governor needs to close all nonessential businesses and people need to stay in their homes. My wife and I started prepping in early February and have been at home exclusively for over 3 weeks.  Did go for a nice drive yesterday but did not get out of car.

Florida is 3rd largest state but has not followed lead of NY and CA.  This will be a disaster within a week.  FL needs a governor like Cuomo  or Newsome who are very proactive.  This is not a political issue or even a 2 week ordeal.  For many Floridians it is a matter of life or death or having irreversible lung damage. It affects the older persons and even the  invincible younger ones. This is not the flu  but rather a horrible disease.

Publix and Trader Joe's are not permitting checkout people to wear gloves or masks because it will make customers scared.  Are they kidding.  Checkout people see hundreds of customers a day and  handle cash and  groceries.  China was burning cash to stop the spread of the virus.   When we run out of food in several months we will have to figure out how to resupply.  Maybe Amazon will still be shipping then."|Florida|2020|True|0
"[NEW: As requested, a [downloadable PDF](https://docdro.id/30e3nnc) version of this document is now available to send to relatives]

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [300,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)). Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

* [Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/) with regards to this section.

#**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China.)

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking](https://twitter.com/kr3at/status/1240296333354950658?s=19)/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx)). Quitting now [can save your life](https://coronawiki.org/page/covid-19-the-role-of-smoking-cessation-during-respiratory-virus-epidemics).

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

* **UPDATE:** March 18th: ""99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says"" ( [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkq6vz/99_of_those_who_died_from_virus_had_other_illness/) )

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds)).

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w). March 17th update: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" (Source [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)). March 20th update: Latest genome analysis seems to suggest two viruses may have combined ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-origins-genome-analysis-covid19-data-science-bats-pangolins/))

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), which will be kept up to date (as will any PSA I posted myself, as long as it's still on the main page of your sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

Anyone know where I can go to see if I HAD the virus at some point? I don’t want a test to see if I currently have it.

"Hi guys I messed up big time having unprotected sex with a potential positive partner. Encounter was about three weeks ago and the anxiety is really starting to take over now. Without being specific I work in an industry where this can be a potential career ender which is unfortunate given how advanced treatment is now. My original plan was to wait 3 months for a more accurate OraQuick home test then a subsequent lab test following but I am honestly not sure I can contain myself to wait that long as I have had incredibly mild but also very common early HIV symptoms at the three week mark.

Based on the CDC website it would appear that confidential testing would mean my results would still be shared with the state etc and with my personal information could find its way into a database or something which I am trying to avoid until I can figure things out. Are there any testing centers that can get me a ""early"" result that don't require identifying information and forms to be filled out?

For the record I do not plan on having sex with anyone anytime soon especially unprotected as this encounter and the seriousness has in a way traumatized me a bit.  Currently just trying to figure out if my fears are even confirmed and if they are what I can next to prepare prior to having it on record. :(

&#x200B;

EDIT: I know this comes across as selfish and I guess in some ways it is. Why do I need it to be a secret? I can't go into super specifics due to paranoia but all I can say is the career in question poses ZERO way of me transferring it to anyone. I don't do any medical field things, no blood exposure, no sex (if it wasnt obvious), etc.. Treatment is the potential deal breaker not HIV itself. Sounds backwards doesn't it... not that it is good reasoning but the only risk is my own health by not taking action. It's a hard pill to swallow and I wish I could go back in time and drill that into my head and maybe I would have been able to save myself this post. The amount of fear this has given me makes me very much not interested in potentially passing this on to someone else. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, that is not my intention with this post. Thanks for the replies. Hopefully I can find peace."|phoenix|2023|True|0

A little background - I am considered high risk due to Lupus/Autoimmune issues. I have been experiencing some gnsrly symptoms and was referred to get tested by my PCP and Hartford Healthcare phone screening. It took 3 days to get an appointment for testing and Midstate was the quickest one to get into. I was dreading the nasal testing after seeing/reading so much online. When I drove up today, it was a simple throat swab (like you would do for Strep throat). I'm a little confused....as I thought the nasal test was necessary and the accurate way to be tested. Does anyone have any more information on this? I can't seem to find much info online besides articles saying it should be both nasal and throat.|Connecticut|2020|True|0
"I’m amazed daily at things I see on the internet each day.. and things I see out my own window as I’m sitting isolated to keep me safe and others.

But frozen food you can keep that longer than fresh foods. But bags of pasta, rice , cans of tuna. Do we all want nice steaks and burgers fresh meat and veggies Dailey yes. However they don’t last more than a week and you’ll need to go back. The point is to limit you and other to exposures you may or may not have. It’s not about eatting  gourmet night it’s having something to eat to make it by

-brew your own coffee.  Dunkin’ Donuts should not have lines daily. I would drink two dd coffees a day haven’t had one in two weeks miss it greatly. However  made to order coffee is a luxury not essential.   The kid at that drive thru sees how many people Daily is he virus free was everyone he sees. Or is it being passed along all day.

"I'm looking for good GP recs for Brisbane, because I'm going off my rocker! I've been ill for MONTHS.

I have had strep throat / tonsillitis since February, my regular GP just wants to throw increasingly powerful antibiotics at it to the point I'm functioning at half capacity from fatigue while the infection isn't worse or better.

I went to another doctor today to try and get a referral to a specialist. She got very defensive when I said I had seen another doctor and already had a diagnosis. She angrily told me ""she was a great doctor"", (I had said nothing to suggest otherwise, I was literally describing my symptoms), and then said ""you've picked a great day for this"" because it's Sunday before ANZAC day. She refused to send me to a specialist and prescribed tests I've already gotten to tell me what I already know. This isn't the first time something like this has happened.

I'm in a kafkaesque sisyphean nightmare and I want OUT. PLEASE.

Is there ANY GP in Brisbane that doesn't mind referring someone who isn't getting better to a specialist. I just want a doctor who doesn't think me SEEKING HELP for a medical condition is an INSULT to their DOCTORING ABILITIES or whatever.

"Hi all,
I have been eating inordinate amounts of spinach lately (at least half a small bag every day, if not more). I have also received an email from Coles stating their records show I purchased an affected product.

I experienced a range of symptoms (Minor slurring of speech, dry mouth and skin, flushed face, heart racing, among others. No delirious episodes that I'm aware of).

Maybe I'm being a hypochondriac, but I am concerned. I plan to go see a doctor to get checked out for peace of mind. 

My main question is this: I've already consumed the spinach and thrown out the packages. Am I still entitled to a refund? Is there a body I should report my experience to in case there are longer term consequences?

" I  (22F) am definitely long overdue to see one, but a bit apprehensive  since all my previous experiences with psychologists were... Not good.

My  #1 choice would be someone who can see me via telehealth, since I  actually live a few hours out of Melbourne. I understand that this may  not be possible, so I'm also open to suggestions for people in the CBD  or along the Gippsland line (Pakkie, Dandenong, Clayton, Caulfield etc)  who I can travel to. I'm looking for people who are currently accepting  new patients, which I know rules out a lot already.

I'm  looking for someone who's experienced with female ASD and ADHD. Would  strongly prefer someone who's experienced working with young adults. Not  expecting to find someone experienced specifically with cult-related  trauma, but someone who works with emotional abuse or something is  probably close enough.

I find it  very off-putting when psychologists try to dive into a very rigid  approach (such as immediately making me choose whether I want to do CBT  or DBT, when I mention having symptoms of anxiety). I guess I'd probably  rather have someone with whom I can talk everything out with.

I'd prefer someone who's friendly/warm, but also a good psychologist. Bulk-billing would be a cherry on top, but not necessary.

"As the situation is inevitably worsening, I would like to share some of our views and the Chinese side of the story. I feel like the media is not really sharing much about the situation other than numbers and how people are being isolated for treatment, so I hope this provides some insight.

(Furthermore, I would like to voice some of my personal thoughts on the situation below as well.)

A little about me:

I’m currently a uni student here at UniMelb, and I’ve lived here in Australia since I was very young, so I would like to say I’m pretty familiar with Australian culture. I’m very attached to Chinese culture as well, and my girlfriend is currently in China and is coming back to resume uni (btw, not from Wuhan).

**The coronavirus, how did this happen?**

I’m definitely not any medical expert, but from Chinese sources and Weibo (our Twitter), it seems to be: Bats, wildlife, people dumb enough to eat them without any precaution.

Please. Don’t suddenly get this misconception that us Chinese are bat-eating monsters. The majority of us eat the same meats as you do (while quite a lot do like eating organ meats, it’s still the same animals), with the rare few that like to take it to the extreme.

For the Aussie-equivalent, we all eat poultry, beef, pork and seafood, some like to experiment the kangaroo and crocodile. And then pops out this guy who boils this kookaburra or fries a wombat. This is “the guy” we’re talking about, who started this.  (only for illustrative purposes)

**All the Chinese are suddenly wearing facemasks, are they sick?**

The whole point of this disease that is making this situation horrific, is that for the first few days or more (don’t credit me on this, refer to medical sources), we don’t know. The symptoms only show after being infected, and by that time you can’t even count how many people you’ve spread it to.

A few points that I hope are clear:

If we haven’t returned to China during this Lunar New Year, we most likely have been staying in Australia prior to the virus. Most of us should be fine.

We are worried about the people who have returned after the virus outbreak, and before the airport checks and government putting more attention to the situation.

We are wearing masks to protect ourselves from others, while at the same time not wanting to infect others if we do have the virus and symptoms haven’t shown.

(Please don’t be rude and make fun of the face masks. It’s happened during the last few days and this is one of my motivations of making this post.)

We encourage you all to take some precautions on this as well, Chinese or non-Chinese.

**Is it rude to stay at a distance to the Chinese right now?**

While I’m in no place to represent everyone and it really depends on each situation, I personally wouldn’t mind it.

As long as we all stay respectful and don’t make rude comments and weird looks, we’re fine. Hell, we’re staying distances from each other, not to mention others.

In all seriousness, if a Chinese is close to you that is coughing without a mask, leave, get cleaned up and take disinfection precautions.

**What do we think of the situation?**

We are more infuriated than anyone about this situation right now. The timing could not be any worse. Everyone’s hyped up for our New Year’s celebrations, everyone’s anticipating for the huge movies that are coming out, everyone’s shopping for gifts and decorations.

All of a sudden, we’re encouraged to stay home, transportation services have closed down, and the hit movies have all been withdrawn until further notice.

(Side story: A popular actor/director Zheng Xu has released his movie completely free online to support the situation and encourage everyone to stay home. Sure, there are sponsorships and deals and stuff, the box office would’ve still been much more than that. What a lad.)

Imagine all of Melbourne being ready for New Years, then suddenly the fireworks are cancelled, all the bars and restaurants and shops have been told to close, and all are encouraged to stay home. Same deal.

Especially for the people in Wuhan, who have no idea that there are people eating bats, and have probably planned travels after New Year’s. They are now completely locked in the city. It’s pretty much like the Simpsons where that dome is on Springfield, but now it’s happening for real. Not to mention all the doctors, nurses and others who are risking their lives and giving up their time with family for New Year’s to stop the virus.

People are pissed, people are ranting all over Weibo about why people are eating bats (or not taking any precautions for eating them), people are praying for their family and Wuhan to get better soon.

**What’s going to happen now?**

Well the virus outbreak has already begun and it’s most likely going to get worse. A main reason is that the governments reaction times are arguably slow. (However, I do understand that it would be very controversial to take any large-scale action in China at an early stage during the Lunar New Year Period, and Australia is too busy sorting out the fires. But the main focus of this post isn’t about any politics or backstory, so I won’t go any more into that.)

China’s going on full power to stop the virus (to put this in perspective, a 1000-patient hospital is getting built, in 6 days). Vaccines are getting looked into, from professionals in both China and other countries around the world. I guess another positive note for us Australians, is that most viruses are much weaker in hotter temperatures, so the situation would most likely be resolved in a few months.

Thanks for reading up to this point. I hope this has given you an insight on our side of the story. As the situation is directly pointing at the Chinese, I really hope that the situation is more transparent and there are no conflicts and miscommunications about this. Please share this to other social platforms and friends so more people can understand our view on the virus.

Thanks again,

a Chinese student who loves Melbourne.

" Yesterday, while I was driving through Canby, Oregon, a police car behind me turned on their lights. I assumed they were trying to cut through traffic to pursue someone else, so I moved to the middle crossing lane. But then I realized they were pulling me over. He asked me to pull over to the right and I complied. 

The officer asked me to move to the right side, and I did. When he approached my car, he asked me why I had stopped in the middle lane. I told him that I had an anxiety disorder and ADHD, and I was scared, so I stopped in the nearest lane. The officer then explained that I was being pulled over for distracted driving, as part of a routine traffic stop program.

He mentioned that my car smelled like marijuana and asked if I had taken any drugs. I told him that I was on Adderall (prescription) and Wellbutrin(also prescription), and that I had taken my second dose of Adderall 10-15 minutes prior. I also told him that I had smoked in my car and eaten an edible about 11 hours earlier.

The officer asked me to take a field test, which I did. My balance was off, but I told him that I had sciatica and could provide medical documentation. He also noticed that my pupils were very dilated , but that was because of my medication. 

Eventually, I was arrested for DUII and released after giving a urine sample and taking a breathalyzer test, as well as doing another set of tests. The officer told me that he believed I was high due to my eye dilation and rapid heart rate. However, most of these ""symptoms"" were just side effects of my medication. I was completely compliant and coherent throughout the entire process, but now I'm facing a DUI charge.

I don't have the funds for a lawyer, but this charge might damage my ability to get into college and receive financial aid. I don't know what to do, but any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated."|Portland|2024|True|0
"My partner and I have suddenly developed cold symptoms  yesterday which then worsened very fast over the course of one day and night. We suspect it to be covid but no testing clinics nearby are open, we don’t have cars to go to further ones and also don’t want to risk passing it to other people on public transport. 

We can’t do phone consultations with our regular GP since last time we had a face to face appointment was more than 12 months ago. Most medical clinics I looked up also have the same policy where those who haven’t had an in person consultations at their practice (including new patients) can’t book in for an over the phone consultation.

Even when the nearby testing clinic opens tomorrow and we do get tested, we still wouldn’t be able to book for a GP visit until we receive a negative result, which will take a while (or worse receive a positive result and not being able to book one at all). 

We are not very familiar with the healthcare system here and neither of us have families in Sydney. My partner is having a pretty bad fever and I don’t know how to get access to a doctor, I feel so helpless. And I’ve been having trouble sleeping for days so I don’t think I’m in my clearest mind to make decisions and finding solutions. 

Please if anyone knows how to get access to a GP in this scenario please please let me know. I don’t know what to do.

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your replies! My partner‘s fever has done down a bit for now (39℃ To 37.8℃). And I was able to fall sleep for a little bit so I’m not as much on edge anymore and can think a bit straighter now.  

My partner and I decided that, as many of you have suggested, we shouldn’t be going into shops looking for the testing kits if we are suspected be infectious. We’ve managed to find someone who is able to drop their extra test kits for us later today. And we’ll go in to the nearest testing clinic first thing tomorrow morning to get tested. 

We still couldn’t get access to a GP but we are going to try calling some of the numbers you guys provided. For now we are kind of withholding on the idea of going to ER: our symptoms are not bad enough, if we are negative going in will increase our risk of getting covid, if we are positive going in will increase other people’s risk of getting covid. So we’ll leave this option until our condition worsens to the point that we have to."|sydney|2021|True|1

Been isolating in a room at the farm house and was going to get tested yesterday but by the time my partner got home the testing clinic was closed.  I am double vaccinated (pfizer).  Been off work since Wednesday and still not feeling any better.    
  
Now I think is the time to see a doctor to find out what's wrong with me.  I don't believe it is covid as I have not left the farm in about 2 weeks but I will get tested just in case.   
  
I know back at home there is walk in clinics in almost every small town and city across the county that you can show up to without a booking. I think I'm safe to assume it's not the same here.     
  
If anyone can give me the lowdown that would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you"|sydney|2021|True|0
Tested negative the other day but today all of a sudden I have a fever and am coughing and really need to know if I have Covid or something else.

"My wife and I are both exhibiting symptoms.  I'd call them on the high side of mild---we're both fairly miserable but safe and quarantined.  Breathing is pretty decent, but some shortness of breath.  We're achy, exhausted, and running a low grade fever.  Neither of us has lost our sense of taste or smell.

Can't seem to schedule a test because we're not passing the screening process.  The our local health department DOES have testing  (we're in Hamilton county) but the next available appointment is November 30, which I'm sure it'll be all passed by then.

"[I don't know how to make text bold or italicised yet but this is taken from the article].

""A TEENAGE resident of a student college at the University of Queensland's St Lucia campus in Brisbane's west has tested positive to meningococcal disease.

Close contacts of the 18-year-old woman have been given antibiotics to help reduce the risk of the bacteria being transmitted further.

The infection, described as ""severe, but uncommon"", is difficult to contract without close and prolonged contact with someone who has the bacteria.

Although most people with the bacteria remain well, they can spread the germ to others, who may develop symptoms. At any given time, meningococcal bacteria are carried harmlessly at the back of the throat or in the nose in about 10 per cent of the community.

Infection occurs when meningococcal bacteria invade the body from the throat or nose.

Symptoms can include a high fever, vomiting, fatigue, joint pain, a stiff neck and a purple rash that spreads quickly.

So far this year in Queensland, 37 patients have tested positive to meningococcal disease, compared with 45 for the whole of last year."""|brisbane|2017|True|0
"Around May 15th I'm making a move from Chicago to NC due to a lot of life changes recently (heartbreak, coronavirus uncertainty). After 13 years in Chicago, I've decided to move all my things to storage for the time being, load my motorcycle with some camping gear, and ride south to stay with family. 

I know it's a strange time to be going on a road trip, but it'll save me money, keep me socially isolated, and it'll be a welcome dose of freedom in this cabin-fever time.

I'll be coming the route through Columbus OH, down 35, to 64, to 77. Once I'm in WV I'd love to find spots to camp, and country highways to make the ride more fun. 

I'll have a simple tarp and hammock setup. I'm hoping state parks will be open by May 15th, which would make finding a camp site a lot easier, but who knows. I can always stay at a hotel in a pinch, but I'd like to avoid it.

I'd love advice from locals on how to find the best spots to camp (or areas to avoid), or some specific sites along the way to check out (or drives to enjoy). Really any suggestions or insight would be greatly appreciated.

"I called the hotline to get tested because I have minor symptoms (cold-like symptoms) and the person I sit next to at work has tested positive. My boyfriend also has symptoms as well as my dad. None of us will get tested because we do not have coughs or fevers, but the odds I have it are high considering the proximity to my coworker.

Like the title says, the number of cases is A MINIMUM because they are only among those who were able to get tested. So, if there’s no cases in your town yet it could mean nobody has been tested.

"So it seems you’ve tested positive for the Chinese virus, the so-called Covid NINETEEN, the Corona—nobody knows what to call it, quite frankly. It’s the most amazing thing, no one knew anything about Corona until a few weeks ago. 

But the moment I heard about it—the Wuhan flu; it’s also the Wuhan, or WuHAAN—that’s a city in China. Many people don’t know that. But the moment I heard about this Chinese flu, I ordered a test. And it’s an amazing test. We do better testing than anywhere in the world. Some say the Germans have the best tests, but they don’t. Our tests are even better.

So you’re positive for Corona. And usually “positive” is a positive word—it’s a very good word, frankly. Everybody thinks it’s good, apart from what you hear on the news—which is fake. It’s largely fake. But in medicine, “positive” is not so good. So it’s very confusing. And I’ve always been very clear about that. Some say “positive” is always good, but I’ve never agreed with that.

So you’re positive for the Corona. But you’ll be fine. Totally fine. You might think you’re going to die—and everybody does die, eventually. But you’ll be fine. You feel fine, right? You won’t need a ventilator. There are no ventilators—but you won’t need one. 

How old are you, 55? You won’t need one. Some people need a ventilator, and they’re amazing machines. Did you know the first ventilator was made by Henry Ford? It’s an incredible piece of equipment. But you’ll be fine.

The virus gets into your lungs, which is where you breathe. But you have two of them. Some say you have a spare. Some people only have one lung. It’s true. But I don’t talk about spares. I always want both. Given a choice, I want two lungs.

So I’ve asked nurse—what’s your name, Nancy?—I’ve asked nurse Nancy to keep you comfortable. And Nancy is one of our finest nurses. I mean, just look at her. Incredible, right? Nancy, you’re really incredible. You’re not afraid of Corona, are you, the Chinese Plague? I didn’t think so. Nancy will bring you whatever you need. And if you start coughing, do that into your elbow, so you don’t make a mess. Okay, you’re doing great. I’ll see you later."|Connecticut|2020|True|0

Avoid high-traffic parks, and opt for lesser known spots.

And it's not just CT, so many states are struggling with this right now. I tried to take my girls (2 dogs) out to hike in a park that's always empty yesterday.

There was a little girl, about 6 leaning against my car and tapping the side with her hands and right as I rolled my window down to ask her to move she coughed. Taking your kid to a packed park right now is idiotic enough, but doing it while your kid is coughing?

Listen, I love the outdoors and I'm so happy to see so many people enjoying nature, but let's not forget we are literally in the middle of a pandemic. This isn't vacation.

"(this is taken from other subs mostly) 

Coronavirus bio: 

- 5% of people require [artificial respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_ventilation), an additional 15% need [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy). Overall, about 80% of cases are mild, and 20% severe. Overall, there has been a case fatality rate of around ~3.6%. For comparison, the flu is about ~0.096%. The r-0 of this virus has been said to be around 3.5 to 6. The r-0 of influenza is about 1.3. Please stop spreading the ""its just a flu"" misinformation. 

- Infection lasts 2 to 4 weeks for mild cases, 3 to 6 weeks in severe cases. Reinfection is possible and has been confirmed in multiple cases. 

- People can spread the disease before they show any symptoms, ie you can infect other people before you know you are sick. 

- Infection is primarily spread through aerosolized respiratory droplets. Fecal transmission is highly likely as well and possibly more infectious. 

- In China, we saw the local healthcare system in Hubei completely overwhelmed. This is a bad thing, as the healthcare systems being overwhelmed might possibly mean a higher death rate (20% of patients need intensive treatment afterall). In China, mass quarantines and lockdowns have been used to contain the disease. Currently, the CCP is reporting falling infection numbers in their country, although these numbers are suspect for obvious reasons. 

- The virus can be spread by a person before they exhibit any symptons, ie a person can spread it before they know they are sick. 

- The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

- Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (untreated diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

- [Fatality rate by age](https://files.catbox.moe/l5q4fy.png)

- Sex: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

- There is [some unsubstantiated speculation that the disease may cause infertility in men](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418v1.full.pdf). There has also been unsubstantiated speculation that the disease may be deadlier in people of asian descent due to the aforementioned ACE2 receptor. 

- As you probably already know, there have already been confirmed communal transmissions of coronavirus on the west coast (not able to be traced to China) 

**What you can do to prepare**: The less you have to go out, the less your chances of contracting this disease. If you are a healthy young person, you may feel safe, but please remember you probably also have contact with some elderly people, like your parents or grandparents. Even if you don't, you getting infected. So my advice to you is: 

- **MAKE SURE your elderly relatives are taken care of and know what to do and what to avoid doing.** This is by far the most important thing imo. They are the most at risk rn. 

- Avoid restaurant eating and going out for nonessential reasons. 

- Stockpile some non perishable food, just in case we get quarantines/lockdowns as has happened in Italy and China. I've gotten a bunch of canned food and some butter and things to freeze. 

- Make sure you have first aid and medicine supplies. If you get sick with something other than coronavirus during this pandemic, the absolute last place you will want to go is to the healthcare system, since it will be completely overwhelmed and you will most likely contract the virus there. 

- Just to be safe, I have gotten p100's, but the CDC says m95's will be effective. Surgical masks do probably have reduced effectiveness, but I'd always take them over nothing. Airtight goggles might also help. Also remember to get things like toothpaste, **soap,** toilet paper, ammunition, and other such things. Standard disaster preparedness."|Connecticut|2020|True|0
"Not posting this to argue. Just to provide scientific information. 

This voice should be the ONLY voice we are following on Covid19.
Based on information from Dr. Fauci. 

“Chickenpox is a virus. Lots of people have had it, and probably don't think about it much once the initial illness has passed. But it stays in your body and lives there forever, and maybe when you're older, you have debilitatingly painful outbreaks of shingles. You don't just get over this virus in a few weeks, never to have another health effect. We know this because it's been around for years, and has been studied medically for years
Herpes is also a virus. And once someone has it, it stays in your body and lives there forever, and anytime they get a little run down or stressed-out they're going to have an outbreak. Maybe every time you have a big event coming up (school pictures, job interview, big date) you're going to get a cold sore. For the rest of your life. You don't just get over it in a few weeks. We know this because it's been around for years, and been studied medically for years.

HIV is a virus. It attacks the immune system and makes the carrier far more vulnerable to other illnesses. It has a list of symptoms and negative health impacts that goes on and on. It was decades before viable treatments were developed that allowed people to live with a reasonable quality of life. Once you have it, it lives in your body forever and there is no cure. Over time, that takes a toll on the body, putting people living with HIV at greater risk for health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, bone disease, liver disease, cognitive disorders, and some types of cancer. We know this because it has been around for years, and had been studied medically for years.

Now with COVID-19, we have a novel virus that spreads rapidly and easily. The full spectrum of symptoms and health effects is only just beginning to be cataloged, much less understood.
So far the symptoms may include:
Fever
Fatigue
Coughing
Pneumonia
Chills/Trembling
Acute respiratory distress
Lung damage (potentially permanent)
Loss of taste (a neurological symptom)
Sore throat
Headaches
Difficulty breathing
Mental confusion
Diarrhea
Nausea or vomiting
Loss of appetite
Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19 (even in the relatively young)
Swollen eyes
Blood clots
Seizures
Liver damage
Kidney damage
Rash
COVID toes (weird, right?)

People testing positive for COVID-19 have been documented to be sick even after 60 days. Many people are sick for weeks, get better, and then experience a rapid and sudden flare up and get sick all over again. A man in Seattle was hospitalized for 62 days, and while well enough to be released, still has a long road of recovery ahead of him. Not to mention a $1.1 million medical bill.

Then there is MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. Children with MIS-C may have a fever and various symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, or feeling extra tired. While rare, it has caused deaths.

This disease has not been around for years. It has basically been 6 months. No one knows yet the long-term health effects, or how it may present itself years down the road for people who have been exposed. We literally *do not know* what we do not know.

For those in our society who suggest that people being cautious are cowards, for people who refuse to take even the simplest of precautions to protect themselves and those around them, I want to ask, without hyperbole and in all sincerity:
How dare you?

How dare you risk the lives of others so cavalierly. How dare you decide for others that they should welcome exposure as ""getting it over with"", when literally no one knows who will be the lucky ""mild symptoms"" case, and who may fall ill and die. Because while we know that some people are more susceptible to suffering a more serious case, we also know that 20 and 30-year-olds have died, marathon runners and fitness nuts have died, children and infants have died.

How dare you behave as though you know more than medical experts, when those same experts acknowledge that there is so much we don't yet know, but with what we DO know, are smart enough to be scared of how easily this is spread, and recommend baseline precautions such as:
Frequent hand-washing
Physical distancing
Reduced social/public contact or interaction
Mask wearing
Covering your cough or sneeze
Avoiding touching your face
Sanitizing frequently touched surfaces

The more things we can all do to mitigate our risk of exposure, the better off we all are, in my opinion. Not only does it flatten the curve and allow health care providers to maintain levels of service that aren't immediately and catastrophically overwhelmed; it also reduces unnecessary suffering and deaths, and buys time for the scientific community to study the virus in order to come to a more full understanding of the breadth of its impacts in both the short and long term.

It did not appear to apply to the Pre Check. Just the regular security line. It tripled the time it took to get through security.

My partner is a emergency department nurse at a public hospital in the Brisbane area. With the current covid-19 outbreak she is one of the brave troopers at the frontline and you'd think everyone would be grateful for their work and service, right?

WRONG!

[Official statements from QLD Government.](http://statements.qld.gov.au)

This is the best resource for information about what to do with the current COVID-19 outbreak if you are a QLD resident: what to watch for, what to do if you’re sick, when you may be tested, and guidelines on reducing infection/isolating yourself. I have also updated this post with some other questions and information but I'm trying to keep things evidence-based, not speculative. I'm trying to use public health resources that are easy for people to read, as opposed to clinical journals aimed at HCPs.

[Should I be concerned?](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-quiz) A quick quiz to see whether or not you should be concerned over your symptoms (eg whether or not you need to see a doctor urgently for testing).

[Information on testing for COVID-19](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/take-action/testing-and-fever-clinics) How testing works, who gets tested, and fever clinic information. [All fever clinics are listed here.](https://qfinder2.health.qld.gov.au/#q=Fever&page=1) This includes pretty much every public hospital. Please read the operating times for fever clinics and any special instructions - priority is given to patients who meet current testing criteria, and if you do not meet criteria you may be turned away especially outside of these hours. Your GP should also be able to arrange for testing - you should call them first to discuss your symptoms and obtain further advice before seeing them.

New testing criteria include recent international travel, or close contact with someone who has travelled internationally in the last 14 days (who is a confirmed case) with a fever, **or** acute respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, cough or sore throat) with or without fever.

[Self quarantine advice.](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/take-action/self-quarantine) Slightly outdated as all returning overseas travel must self-quarantine now, but answers some common questions on what to do.

**Department of Communities Assistance**
If you are experiencing hardship due to self-quarantine, you can contact the Department of Communities for assistance. They may be able to assist you with food/necessities, financial hardship, medications, funeral expenses, advocacy, rental/mortgage assistance, and care assistance. You can call them on 1800 173 349.

There are other resources to inform you about COVID-19 and the QLD Health response on the site.


**Other Useful Information or questions**



*What is COVID-19 and how does it spread?*

[WHO Q&A on COVID-19 and Coronaviruses - transmission, infection, symptoms, etc.](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) COVID-19 is the name given to the disease a person has when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (formerly nCoV-2019), a virus that belongs to the Coronavirus family. Other coronaviruses include the common cold, SARS, and MERS. The virus spreads via respiratory droplets - droplets that carry the virus that are expelled from an infected person when they sneeze or cough. Droplets with viral particles can *potentially* survive on shiny, hard surfaces for many hours (uncertain period, not peer reviewed - but strong suspicion). It hasn't been demonstrated to be airborne. Viral particles have been found in stool samples, but probably isn't a major method of transmission.


*Do asymptomatic people really spread it?*

An infected person still needs to shed the virus - by coughing or sneezing, both of which can be symptoms of the disease (typically a dry cough). The danger is that a person in the early stages of infection may not realise they are sick and thus shed the virus unknowingly, without the 'obvious' signs of illness like a fever or feeling unwell. You can't get it from a person who isn't shedding the virus. Treat coughing or sneezing as a potential symptom if it is repetitive.


*How do I prevent it?*

[QHealth - Prevention.](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/take-action/coronavirus-prevention) The best protection is by washing your hands and avoiding touching your face without washing your hands. Soap and water works best, as well as hand sanitiser [so long as it has at least 60% alcohol content](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html). The mechanical action of rubbing your hands together helps to break down the viral envelope and destroy the virus. Hands that are visibly soiled (e.g. globs of snot) should be washed with soap and water (it reduces the effectiveness of hand sanitiser). Other advice includes avoiding unnecessary travel, mass gatherings, and social distancing (approx 1.5m distance between you and other people). **Careful attention to handwashing, hygiene, and social distancing are important.**


*Should I wear a face mask?*

[WHO - When and How to Use Masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)
See the WHO link and the QHealth link from the last question - masks are only recommended if you are actively coughing/sneezing, or if you are providing direct patient care. A surgical face mask (e.g. not the P2/N95) is sufficient for people who are coughing/sneezing. The general public should *not* wear P2/N95 masks as a mere precaution - these are only for close-contact clinical roles and are needed for healthcare providers. They also have to be properly fitted, are strictly single use, and are worn with goggles, gowns, gloves, and proper handwashing techniques. A P2/N95 mask on its own will not protect you, this is false reassurance.


*How likely am I to die/suffer a major medical episode if I'm infected?*

[Current statistics for COVID-19 infections and deaths.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
[Statistics by Demographics](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/)
Most people who get the virus only have a mild illness. The older you are, or the more comorbidities (e.g. preexisting medical problems) you have, the higher the chance for you to suffer a severe illness (e.g. requiring ward admission or intensive care). Actual mortality rates vary by country and reporting - and because this is still a novel virus and there are potentially many infected who aren't tested, nobody knows the exact mortality rate yet. [Why different countries have different rates may be due to healthcare resources availability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32109372-potential-association-between-covid-19-mortality-and-health-care-resource-availability/). Importantly, while you might not suffer a significant illness, you can spread it to people who *may* suffer a significant illness; hence why we all have to follow advice to reduce infection.


*How do I self quarantine?*

[QHealth Advice for Self-Quarantine](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/take-action/self-quarantine)
[WA Self-Quarantine Advice Sheet](https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Files/Corporate/general%20documents/Infectious%20diseases/PDF/Coronavirus/COVID-19%20self-quarantine%20information%20for%20people%20undergoing%20testing.pdf)
[NSW Advice - Do I need to stay away from others in my home?](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/alerts/Pages/coronavirus-faqs.aspx#4-1)
In general - stay home for 14 days (typically the period during which symptoms would be expected to appear), avoid contact with others in your house as much as practicable (social distancing), and be extremely careful with coughing/sneezing and handwashing. You must call 13HEALTH if you are on self-quarantine for advice and support. Although somebody who lives with you can stay in that house, they should stay away from you (e.g. confine yourself to a particular part of the house, wear a surgical mask if you have one available, use separate bathrooms if possible). If you are well after your 14 days of isolation you do not need to take further action and can stop.


*How do I do social distancing?*

[NSW Advice - Social Distancing](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/alerts/Pages/coronavirus-faqs.aspx#sec5)
Keep 1.5m away from people in general, especially those who are coughing or sneezing. Avoid handshakes, hugs, kissing, etc. Avoid visiting places where vulnerable people reside (e.g. aged care facilities, elderly family, hospitals, etc). **Everyone** should be practising social distancing.


*Why is the government doing/not doing x or y?*

[The goal is to flatten the curve of infections](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/flatten-the-curve-meaning) to attempt to avoid overloading the healthcare system with a sudden spike in severe cases, preserving healthcare capacity for as long as possible. [Pathology testing is under immense stress](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/professional/chief-medical-officer-update-on-coronavirus-testin) which is why there are criteria for identifying cases that **need** testing, instead of testing every single person who presents to the clinic asking for a test. This isn't ideal, but with short supply testing will be ordered for cases that are likely to return positive, or where the positive test may alter the treatment provided. The time for containment has probably passed."|brisbane|2020|True|0
"Although it is said that masks are only required if one is sick to prevent the spread of diseases to others, considering the asymptomatic phase of the virus and the “less symptomatic” phase, shouldn’t companies like supermarkets and pharmacies consider providing masks to their staff such that they not only give patrons a peace of mind, but also do their part in preventing the spread of the virus? Supermarkets and pharmacies because these are places sick people would still need to go to. Maybe less so on the supermarkets, but the pharmacy? Probably 80% of their patrons are sick. Won’t the staff just become vessels for transmission if nothing is done? Moreover, during this stressful period, I’m quite sure the number of patrons to pharmacies will double, if not triple, resulting is a much higher probability that local transmission may occur?

Edit: the idea of being “sick” is really based on perception. A runny nose due to COVID might just be passed on as an allergy to dust (dust is everywhere). A cough due to COVID might just be excused as a dry throat from the pack of chips. A heavy chest due to early stages of pneumonia due to COVID might be passed on as bad sleeping posture the night before. So why take chances? Protect your staff, protect your patrons and in the minds of businessmen, protect the reputation of your business, or at least do your best to protect them."|brisbane|2020|True|0

"WARNING: LONG. Would only recommend for those this is relevant to, however, anyone that has ever gone through or currently in the Australian secondary or tertiary education system will find something here.

ATAR is bullshit. Yes, it's the best measure of your rank compared to the rest of Australia but the entire Year 11 and 12 system is an absolute joke. I finished 176th out of 178 students at an elite private school in Perth. For years, I had assumed that I too perhaps was just not suited to academia. Perhaps there was simply something wrong with my brain and I doubted whether I would ever have a non-manual-labour future. After finishing with an ATAR not good enough for TAFE, I ended up repeating year 12 at a great adult college and enrolling in a degree that would make my parents happy. A year later, I then enrolled in something I actually had an interest in, finished that, and have now commenced a Commonwealth-supported place for the Juris Doctor at a 'group of 8' university. Among my current peers, many of whom finished with 95+ ATAR's, none would guess I didn't even log on to check my first ATAR out of shame (I know it couldn't have been enough for TAFE though, given I received a 20 for my Physics mock and fell asleep in the Chemistry exam). I was amongst the lowest performing students that year, both in my school and nationwide. Looking back, there is so much pressure from family, friends, and peers to 'achieve' and outdo others, rather than just doing your best and learning for the sake of learning.

I hope some of you can relate to this thought process.

""I have to get a 99 ATAR. As long as I get an 86 in Maths, 91 in English.. etc. I CAN DO IT!""  
\*First assessment comes back and it's 75/100 (still great)\*  
""Okay, well I guess I can get 95, BUT NO LOWER!""  
\*After 3 months, instead of trying to improve gradually and stay positive, you lived in constant anxiety and ended up with average of 70 across board, still on track for a decent mark though.\*  
""What's even the point?...""\*End up with 50s and 60s for the rest of the year as you feel like a failure due to not immediately meeting the ridiculous standards set for you from society\*

To start, I'll go through all that is ridiculous about WACE or HSC or whatever it is called where you are, especially considering how radically different uni becomes.

1. Exam conditions. During my whole time at uni, I have NEVER had an exam more than 2 hours. ATAR exams are typically 3 hours each, and for WA at least, occur just a few weeks after another set of 3 hour exams. Considering your Mock's are worth, typically, 50%, your entire supposed future at 17 is based on 6 hours of exams that occur within 4-6 weeks of each other. This is even more crazy considering many university assessments are assignments, which allow you to go at your own pace - meaning you are on a level playing field against those that don't suffer from anxiety/have better attention spans. For example, English is a subject that it makes NO sense to have a three-hour, regimented exam for (bar potentially budgetary/marking efficiency reasons). I am an English major and had a final year GPA of 6.5, however, I just about failed WACE English as I found the 'closed-book', 3 hour conditions to be stressful and completely against the spirit of what English is supposed to be - creative expression. Furthermore, the obsession with 'INTRO, BP1, BP2, BP3, CONCLUSION' AND NOTHING ELSE is ridiculous. Why not offer a creative option? Or students being permitted to choose their own topic, submitted in advance? For my final year at Uni, one one class had an Exam and it was a 2 hour, 2 essay assessment which we just about knew the questions for before. At Uni you can consult weekly with your tutor and they are there to help you and ensure your success. At school, teachers are spread thin, you're in a class with 24 others and you receive about as much individual attention as a hotel convention room 'self-help' seminar (which, 17 year-olds, is not much, btw).
2. Relentlessness. School is fucking relentless. 5-6 periods a day, 5 days a week, whilst trying to balance some semblance of a social life and figuring out yourself and your changing body and new ideals. Learning that those that supposedly 'love' you and 'want the best' don't even know what they're fucking talking about half the time, and are often living their own failures vicariously through you. Yet, you still have to function within this unit due to being wholly reliant on them for food/shelter/transport/funds/love/care/support. In Europe, you don't finish school in many countries until 20, meaning your final years you can effectively live independently. Also, in Italy for example, at 15, you choose a particular 'school' you would like to attend for your last few years, trade, arts, science, design etc. meaning your peers share your interests and thus one teacher isn't trying to reach 6 different ideologies among 24 students.
3. Money. This is such a paradox. I had a friend whom migrated to Australia in Year 9. His family worked really hard, yet still struggled, and fell below a certain income, thus he was eligible for $250 a fortnight through Youth Allowance. How much do most kids get? $30-$50 a week which is held over you and withheld for any infraction. Some friends got maybe $70-$80 a week, but still this is far, far less than what disadvantaged youth get. This means many kids, in order to gain some sense of financial empowerment, take their partners out, and to not be the 'cheap cunt', have to take on a part-time job; meaning they are spread even more thin for time and study. Please note, this is not at all critical of the Centrelink system, and it's fantastic Australia provides a social, safety net. Just wanted to point out the lack of logic of growing up 'middle-class', being made to feel guilty for wanting a sense of financial security, and how, for youth at least, it can actually be a disadvantage to be 'middle-class' during High School and even until the Centrelink independence cut-off age of 22. That's right 22! Until 22 you are not considered 'independent' without jumping through some massive hoops and hurdles. Meaning if your parents give you $20 a week, and sometimes not even that should you not abide by their wishes, you can just about go and fuck yourself or get a job. Even then, many parents wont even allow or give you grief for getting a job too, ""as it's distracting"".

Fuck that noise. There is a rainbow after the relentlessness.

Uni is at a much more measured pace (for almost every non-science/medical degree at least), so if you didn't get the high ATAR mark you wanted, still got into uni, but are worried that ""I didn't do well at school, so I won't do well at uni."" DONT! Just do not for a second think that. If you want to succeed at uni, you will. Simple. There are typically only 3-4 assessments throughout the semester, with a 6 week break in-between, followed by a 12-week break at the end of the year. You can take a breath and do most of your assessments a few hours a day (recommend rather than spending 12 hours on an essay the day before). Almost all lectures are recorded, meaning you only have to actually go into class for literally 4-6 hours a week for many courses, making it much, much easier to balance work and a social life.Despite all the positives, uni is much less 'in your face' and thus it can be very, very easy to fall into a complacency trap. Here are some common ones:

* If you can, then please go to the lectures/non-compulsory classes as you will be better off. This is not because you can't catch up just as well at home, but it's very, very easy to take this newfound freedom for granted and then end up having to watch 36 lectures in 3 days at the end of the semester. My suggestion is that if you plan to watch them at home, set aside (as in write it down and stick to it!) 4 hours a week to watch each lecture in your own time at home. People say ""make it 2x speed for it to be over quicker"", I suggest the opposite. Rather, make each 0.75x speed and really try to absorb the info and take notes as the lecturer is speaking. You will barely notice a difference, it will only take 15 minutes more for a typical, 45 minute lecture, but it will be much less likely that you have to watch the lectures again to truly absorb them. This is my personal suggestion, however, please experiment with what works for you and Uni is about YOU now, so love yourself, your decisions, and your choices and make them for YOU and you'll be fine!
* Try not to miss ANY assessed classes. You typically can miss up to 3 without a big hit to your participation mark (which is usually 10-20% of your mark overall), however, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST this, especially very early on in semester. Here's why.  
Week 2: ""Damn, I'm really sleepy this morning. I know I missed the first week's class, but I can miss two more classes without missing out any marks. I just have to go to EVERY class from now on, and I will :). Cool. \*Hit's snooze button\*  
Next week: ""Fuck, why did I choose a 9am unit.. Alright, if I miss this, I can still get a good mark if I go to EVERY class from now on.""  
\*You attend every class for next 3 weeks\*  
Week 8: \*Your alarm doesn't go off\* \*You have a relationship/family emergency\* \*Work calls you in\* \*You have an opportunity/something that can ONLY be done now\* \*You are sick or actually tired\* \*You have a big assessment for another unit that you put off/forgot about (it's going to happen, don't say it wont) and you could use the time to finish it off\*  
If you are to miss this class and don't want the hassle of going to the doctor's for a medical certificate, then put yourself in a great position early on by attending all classes until at least week 7/8, especially if you're not going to lectures, then once you're a good deal into the semester you can treat yourself with a sleep in. Also, by attending as much as you can, especially early on and ACTIVELY participating, you maximize your chances to achieve a 100% participation mark. Someone that goes to all classes until week 8, then misses week 9/11, is much more likely to get a good mark than someone that comes in for the first time in week 4, has to introduce themselves, ""Hi, I'm Steve, sorry it's week 4, I was overseas/sick/derp"", even if they miss the same amount of classes.
* Get yourself into the best position you can for the final assessment/exam early on. By getting the max participation mark you can (put your hand up and say some shit, even if it's not right it show's you're interested and keen to learn) and also doing well in the earlier, generally easier assessments, you will need a much lower mark to pass/excel. There are sooo many instances I've seen of myself and others finishing on a 79 or 49, meaning just a few hours extra study or just one more class attended/one more question asked, would have meant the difference between an amazing mark and GPA booster, or 6 more months of your life repeating the same material again due to an F and a massively diminished chance of Post-Grad (it sucks).
* Withdrawing/Deferral culture: For some reason, a logical fallacy exists (I did it too) that withdrawing/getting a doctors note to withdraw/delay an exam/test, will make you do better. Even if you are worried about not excelling, please don't withdraw or put off anything. For my first few years, if I didn't think I could do well I would withdraw before the date that it would show up as a F (around 6 weeks in). This meant it kept my GPA and WAM intact, but I was still liable to pay for the unit. Same principle is going to the doctor's, complaining about a cough, deferring your exam, and getting 6 more weeks to study. Guess what? You've just fucked your holidays, wont get a proper break, probably wont study that hard as ""I have 6 weeks! :) "" and then will do your exam just a week before the semester, pass (probably would have anyways) and then go back to uni with no semblance of relaxation and feel more overwhelmed as a result. I thought I had 'cracked the system' by getting sick notes for my anxiety, but by delaying the ripped band-aid, you're just elongating the process and setting yourself up for eventual failure. This practice stems from a 'fear of failure' but as long as you're conscious and simply break down each unit into bite-sized chunks and 'do your best' you'll pass. Guaranteed. My worst experience was having a shit break due to delaying the exam, spending my holiday period thinking I had heaps of time and making pages of 'study plans' (without any study), only to get to exam day and feeling LESS prepared than during the semester. I ended up withdrawing on the day with another note from the doctor and wasting 6 weeks of my youth for NOTHING.
* Finally, please understand how GPA and WAM works, use it to do your best and keep track of it, but DON'T make it the core focus of your studies. Generally, a 0-49 is a 0, 50-59 is a 4, 60-69 is a 5, 70-79 is a 6, and 80+ is a 7. WMA is the weighted average of your marks, but as almost 99% of units are worth the same weighting (6 credit points in WA) then really it's just an average of your marks. Make your first priority to pass and try to do the best you can, as even 1 failure means a 0 for your GPA which will make incredibly difficult to do post-grad (but not impossible).

You'll do great and HS means NOTHING in the grand scheme of things. Someone I knew from school finished in the '99 club', did a double degree and excelled, Honours, finished his Master's last year, and yet is unemployed and doesn't know where to begin in terms of opportunities. Due to excess study in formative years, he has very little skills that employer's want or real-world experience, which (perhaps unfortunately), is what organizations are looking for. Your degree is the ticket, but YOU are the plane. Don't neglect friendships, fun, and experiences to study. You can have the best of all worlds whilst still being a high-performer, as long as you stay focused and efficient and do your best. Most importantly, please be honest with yourself. Don't set your expectations unrealistically high and feel dejected should you not meet them. Just know that if you do your best, you'll be your best.

I hope this has been helpful and please feel free to comment/PM if you have any further questions. Good luck and do not for a second regret your path as a teenager. Even if your ATAR wasn't good enough for Uni, there are many, many adult-training programs, some as quick as 6 months, that will get you there anyways - feel free to PM for advice."|tasmania|2020|True|0

There are two things you should know about Grandview, Missouri. One is that it is not grand and two is that there is no view.

But I didn’t count any of those as a view. No view, no future, no hope. It didn’t take me four summers to realize those things, I pretty much knew them right away.

My overbearing parents were on a church three times a week kick at the local horrible Southern Baptist Church and I needed any excuse I could get to get away. That meant a summer job. Which was not going to happen in Grandview. There were no jobs anywhere. And no view. And it wasn’t grand.

My dad didn’t mean for us to attend school in Grandview. The plan was for us to go to Christian school but I got my whole family kicked out. My brother was in on it as well, he smoked a lot and he blew up a toilet with M80s. I had fireworks too but mostly my mistake was making a bus full of kids roll down a hill on a field trip to the national typewriter museum in Kansas City. I don’t think its called that anymore or that they even have a museum, I think it went to office supply museum and then to nothing. But back then it was open for school groups and God damn, we were terrible. Every Christian school class with 20 kids is like 5 kids who really love Jesus. They want to be preachers and missionaries and shit or marry a preacher and live for the Lord. And there are 5 kids that HATE Jesus. They wear black every day and paint their nails black and basically exist to be miserable fucks. The other ten people? The ones in the middle? They just want to see stuff lit on fire. Lockers on fire, building on fire, fireworks screamin through the hallways, they were in it for the fire. I was firmly ensconsed in that middle group and I got the whole family kicked out of Christian School.

So we had to go to Grandview High School, which was downright scary. Metal detectors at the doorway, fights, so many God damn fights. My first week there we had 40 different fights. That’s eight a day for those of you keeping score at home. At first the teachers were breaking up the fights but then a teacher got punched in the eye and she lost her eye and no one stood up for her in the administration so after that all the teachers closed the door when a fight started so we were all stuck out in the hall with the fighters. It was fuckin scary. I wanted out of there. I remember the week before graduation from Grandview High School, I had vivid dreams of my dad talking to me for the first time. I mean my dad talked to me, don’t get me wrong but never how are you doin, whats goin on in your life, just hey I told you to take the trash out kind of shit. I remember what I wanted more than anything else in the world, I wanted my dad to sit on the back porch and talk to me. Well you graduate this week I imagined him saying, let me give you some words of wisdom. He never said that of course but I wanted it more than anything in the world, just for my dad to talk to me for once, to care, to notice me. I noticed everything about my dad. The way he adjusted his cap in the sun, the way he rubbed the stubble on his chin, the way he would make a perfect cast out into the water when he would take my brother and me fishing. How big of a fish would I need to catch for my dad to notice me? 

I only remember one time when my dad was present in the moment with me. It was 1987. I remember because the baseball cards from 1987 had a synthetic wood paneling all around the outside of the card, I can picture them now clear as day. I told my dad that some of the Jose Canseco rookie cards were going for $15. Whoa he said, that more than the box. If we buy a box and get one we will break even. I had never seen my dad excited about anything, certainly not anything to do with me. But that day he came home with three boxes of Topps baseball cards, that was one of the best days of my life. He goes come here, come here and he brought the brown paper sack full of baseball cards to his room. I only went into his room when I was in trouble. And that was a lot. My friend at Christian school told me he put a book down his pants when he got spankings and his dad never knew about it. I tried that same thing but dumb ass me put a hard backed book in my pants and I had to get down to my underwear for spankings for awhile after that one. 

But on this day we went to my parents room and he excitedly dumped three boxes of unopened Topps 1987 baseball card packs on the bed. What should we do, should we open them all up now? I asked wide eyed. Yeah, open em all up, lets go! He said smacking his hands together. I ripped open the bag and dumped the full first box onto the bed and we hurriedly tore through the packs. I was stuffing the gum into my mouth as we went and before long we were surrounded in a sea of baseball cards, they were all around us as we ripped through the packs. That whole first box we searched every card but there was not one single Jose Canseco rookie in the box. How can that be I asked, I thought there would be at least one! Well lets try the next one, my dad said optimistically. And he dumped in on the bed and we ripped through the packs again but by now my mouth was too full of gum to eat anymore, I just piled them up on the bed. And there it was. A beautiful Jose Canseco rookie card, staring right at us. I got one, I got one I yelled and held it up for my dad to see, one of my proudest life moments to date. Okay be careful, we need it in mint condition he said. And then he reached for the third box, dumping it onto the bed as hurriedly as the last two. It only took two packs before I found another, I GOT ONE I GOT ONE I yelled and carefully handed it to him. I found another one a couple more packs in. And then the moment I will remember my whole life, he found one in the last pack. THE LAST PACK, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT! HE said and smiled so big and then he did it. He reached over on the bed and hugged me. I don’t remember my dad ever hugging me before or since but on that one day, that one golden summer day surrounded by baseball cards and plastic flavored gum and Jose Canseco rookie cards, my dad hugged me and I choked back the tears. 

Baseball always held an important place in my life but that day it was everything for me. I still loved it after that high school graduation even though my dad and I never had that talk on the porch I wanted so badly. I wanted him to tell me what it was like to be in the war or fall in love or grow old, anything really. Years later my therapist would ask me what I would say to him if I would have had that talk. Easy, I said. Tell me everything. 

The graduation was a windy ceremony on the Grandview High School Football Field and my parents took my ailing grandmother home, I guess they didn’t know about the part where everyone comes in the gym, all the graduates and their family. But they were already home so it was just me alone in the gym saying hi to everyone else’s parents. Jeremy was going to Truman State University in the fall, just like me. We were the only two kids going there. A couple kids were going to Mizzou and a couple to NWMSU but it seemed like the rest of the class was going to Longview, the place where students go to die. I knew a hundred people that went to Longview College and zero that ever got a degree. Our Quarterback was going to Alcorn State University, a historically black college in Mississippi, he was recruited to be the next quarterback after Steve McNair. We were so proud of him, leaving his terrible apartment complex off 140th street behind. That apartment complex was so bad they wouldn’t let us deliver the pizza there at Pizza Hut because it was so dangerous. We had to stop at the guard shack where there was no guard and wait for the resident to walk up, which seemed way more dangerous to me. He was leaving it all behind and we were so proud, but that was short lived because I saw him at Christmas working at Foot Locker at Bannister Mall. What are you doing man I asked incredulously, what happened to Alcorn State? Oh man me and the coach didn’t get along. God damnit, one more soul stuck forever in Grandview. I thought he had the ticket out. We all did. 

I didn’t want that to be me, I wanted to put in one more summer and get the fuck out. My parents said they would pay 100% of my tuition if I went to a Christian school or 50% if I went to a public one, I’ll take 50 I said, 50 is fine before they could even finish their statement. I had already been kicked out of the Christian high school and the one Christian college I visited was a horrible racist place called Liberty University. I hated it so much I stole a bike and peddled off into a town called Lynchburg, Virginia and spent all day playing violent video games and watching R rated movies, I was gone until late into the night and they had to put out an all points bulletin about me because I was missing for more than 15 hours. The University president back then was this racist right wing fuck named Jerry Fallwell and he told me I was not welcome on any campus of Liberty University ever again to which I replied, and I quote, “Good, this place sucks.” I was ready to go off to Truman State but I had to put have one more summer job. My first summer job I drove to Lenexa with my friend Earl every day to do landscape. I got paid $4.75 an hour, that was the bad part. The good part was that on Thursdays we got to mow the maintenance free yards in George Brett’s neighborhood. I peed on George Bretts house every Thursday that summer. Every single Thursday. 
The second summer I worked for a TShirt factory in Stillwell Kansas. 150 Hwy wasn’t built up back then so we had to go through Martin City and over this janky bridge called Kenneth Road Bridge, fuck that thing was scary, no way we should have been driving on it. The person who got us all our jobs that summer was our Young Life leader Charlie who it turns out was a child predator. Young Life is this sketchy youth group kind of thing that has mad “hello fellow kids” vibes but in reality they wanted to touch the young boys. Charlie (or Charles, as he is now known in prison) had four of us that he favored. I played beach volleyball and Ryan was a soccer player, Jordan was a swimmer, and Caleb was a track star. I was Grandview, there was one soccer player from RayPec, one track star from RayPec, and a swimmer who went to Central High school downtown. Kansas City lost this huge fuckin $4 billion desegregation case back then so they were paying for black people to come out south and white people to go downtown, that’s how Caleb got into Central high school with its Olympic pool and its fencing program. Every morning a taxi would come pick him up at his house in Raymore and take him downtown in the world’s worst use of taxpayer dollars. All four of us had the same body type, you wouldn’t say muscular but we all had muscles, just not big, just lanky and more svelte. Charlie would always drive us around the city, we went to a Beck concert one time but he never played Loser, just a bunch of other songs we didn’t know. He would take us to Young Life events and other concerts and to this greasy spoon restaurant called Town Topic. We didn’t know he was grooming us. One of our friends Eric wanted to hang out with us but he was a big beefy football player, I guess that wasn’t Charlie the Young Life Leaders type, he liked the skinnier ones like me. We would later go on to call Eric UM, short for Unmolestable.

I knew I didn’t want to go back to work in the Tshirt factory for Charlie the Young Life pedophile so I looked all around for a job. There were no jobs in Grandview of course, none. Im not sure how the job situation is now but back then there was nothing. I found a job at a place across the state line called Seasonal Concepts, it was a home furnishing store on Metcalf. They sold trees and shit, garnishing, signs for your house, hammocks, all the stuff around the house. The job was pretty easy and the pay was decent, usually the case when you made it far enough to the Kansas side. My dad said it was because the Kansas kids were all rich and lazy but I didn’t care, more money for me I guess. All the Kansas kids I met at the job seemed cool as fuck and they always had weed, nice to smoke in the back alley behind the store. There was an overlap of the managers so the day manager would always leave and the night manager would be straggling, that guy was lazy as fuck but he didn’t like it if he caught you with weed. As soon as the day manager left we would all go out back to the docks and smoke weed and play music on this old school boombox Ryan had, it was some shit like 16 candles and he actually had cassette tapes, one on each side. That time of day was the best, late in the afternoon, just after the day manager left. It used to make me laugh when they would announce over the PA system, Mr. Barnes has left the building, I repeat Mr. Barnes has left the building. We would make a bee line to the back and prop open the door and kick on the music and smoke our minds, God damn I used to get so high. The Kansas kids always had perfectly rolled blunts ready. They would pass them around and me and Willie would smoke them. They never minded, they knew me and Willie were from Grandview and they just figured we were poor as fuck because of my shitty car, I drove a piece of shit 1986 Chevy Cavalier called Betsy. Betsy the Blue Bomber. Willie actually was poor, god damn he was poor, he and three brothers and their mom lived in a tiny two room apartment in the same shitty apartment complex as our quarterback that was too dangerous to deliver pizza too in South Grandview. I would always give him a ride before and after work since he asked Mr. Barnes to make his schedule the same as mine. 

We would sit right there on the ground behind the store and smoke the weed and let it fill our brains and we would put our heads against that brick wall and watch the sun get lower in the sky and feel the warm breeze through the alley and close our eyes and dream about what it would be like. To get the fuck out of Grandview and go off to college, we talked about college women a lot because me and Willie hoped we would have a lot better luck in college than we did in high school. We talked about the jobs we were going to get and the careers, the houses, the cars. In a way I wish I could go back to that time and say hey, fuck all that future stuff. This is where it is good, right here, working at Seasonal Concepts, with your head against the wall, feeling the weed take over your whole body, talking with your friends, this is the good part of life right here, not later. 

It was during one of those smoke seshes that April came running out yelling for me, he is here, she said, he’s here. Who the fuck you talkin about. The baseball player, you told me to tell you when he comes back, whats his name? You guys know. Joe Carter Willie yelled, Joe Carter! Oh Shit, [TOUCH EM ALL JOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX2dJ4K0Oew) IS FUCKIN HERE?!? Yep April said, he’s here and he needs help! That was part of my job, helping people carry out trees and home furnishings and shit. I couldn’t believe I was about to meet one of my heroes! The Toronto Blue Jays had won the World Series in 1992 and 1993. They looked good that year but then the fuckin strike happened and all of baseball shut down. I was a huge baseball fan, April knew it, Willie knew it, everyone knew it. When no customers were inside the store sometimes an associate would yell out a year. 1979, they would say. Pittsburg Pirates, we are family! What about 85 easy, Royals. 1988? That was my favorite, Vin Scully’s iconic call of Kirk Gibsons home run, [HIGH FLY BALL INTO RIGHT FIELD...SHE IS GONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0toCMwEBwLo) I would yell and run around the empty store pumping one arm in Gibson’s chicken wing fashion to the amusement of all the Kansas kids. Everyone knew I loved baseball, even Mr. Barnes knew it. I noticed your sick days coincide with the Royals home day games he told me once. Yeah, weird coincidence I said but he was right, nothing better than sitting out at Kauffman Stadium on a sunny Thursday afternoon with my feet splayed over two rows, hat pulled down low, watching the Royals bullpen get fuckin shelled by teams that could afford steroid players unlike the Royals. I loved the day games. But not that summer, fuckin strike man, what can you do. That’s why Joe Carter was here of course, shopping for trees for his high maintenance wife. He lived in Kansas City but Im sure he would have preferred to be up in Toronto hitting home runs or shagging fly balls at Wrigley or listening to the crowd sing Swet Caroline in Boston. But he was stuck at home with no baseball that summer of 1994, just like the rest of us. Doesn’t matter if you are touch em all Joe, if your wife needs a new tree and you don’t have a job you have to go get it. 

I started running to the front but Willie grabbed me, hey man he said, be cool, don’t be weird. Dude, Im not weird I said, Im super cool. Yeah right, okay buddy. I got to the front of the store and there he was, a hero only one year removed from the biggest home run in World Series history. Imagine if Patrick Mahomes threw last night pass against the Bills in the playoffs to Travis Kelce but instead he would have done it on the last play of the Super Bowl and that would have ended the whole fuckin season? That’s how iconic Carter’s home run was. To this day still the only World Series where the whole Series ended on a walk off home run. Never happened before, never happened since. I could hear that all over and over in my head, TOUCH EM ALL JOE, TOUCH EM ALL! I said that out loud when I got close to Joe Carter struggling with a seven foot tree. Touch em all Joe, how are you man, and I shook his hand. He goes whoa, take it easy buddy, and he looked around with his finger to his lips. Right right, it’s a secret I wont tell anyone you are Touch em all Joe! I said way too loudly, still very high from the Kansas weed in the back. Shh, he tried again, can you help me get this tree out to my car? I said sure, lets do it. I get a dolly and get the tree to his car and I laughed because it was a tiny BMW, I mean tiny and the thought of a giant World Series hero driving that tiny little car made me laugh. Also I was really high. He says, Do you think this will fit in my car, I told my wife I would pick this up. I said sure, you got a sunroof right, open that shit up. 

So he jumped in the car and opened the sunroof and we shoved that seven foot tree through the sunroof huffing and puffing. He dusted off his hands as he shut the back door of the BMW and goes thanks man, I appreciate it. He tried to give me a $10 bill but I said nah man, its okay, you are kind of a hero of mine, Im glad to help. He said alright then, thank you. And he got in that tiny car and drove south down Metcalf towards 435. I watched that little silver dot go all the way up that ramp and then drive west on 435 highway, just that tiny little car with a giant tree sticking out of the top going west into that late summer Kansas sunset. There goes Touch Em All Joe I said to myself, there he goes. There goes Touch em all Joe."|KansasCity|2022|True|0

"I've just read my third article in two weeks about bicycle deaths in Philadelphia. This is insane!

The amount of reckless driving I see in this city on a daily basis is crazy. People going 40-50mph in the city, rolling through red lights and stop signs just to rev their engine as loud as possible. If you slowed vehicles down to 20 mph, you could save countless lives. 

Unfortunately these individuals don't give a fuck about anyone else but themselves and their cool toy they ride around in.

I don't mind the motorcycle gangs that follow the laws - those are just a group of homies trying to go for a sick ride. I'm talking more about people that deliberately put their lives and our lives at risk because of that exhilaration. Go on a highway if you want to go fast.

As a cyclist that follows all of the laws, this is just making me so irritated. We should ticket and fine people for driving like this, and if it calls for it, get rid of their licenses permanently -- sorry, other people's lives are at stake when you roll like this.

Anyone else agree about this complete madness?"|Philadelphia|2020|True|0

"How do I phrase this politely...

Does Brisbane have a dog problem? 

I am convinced that there are two kinds of dog owners. 

Those who have quiet dogs, attentive to their owners who live an inside life, rightfully spoilt, and that’s ok. No harm no foul.

But then there are the others.

I have lived in numerous suburbs where it seems that I am surrounded by people who have gone the “let’s just get a dog to shut the kids up” or “this is gonna look sick for the gram”

I feel Brisbane has a definite ego/authoritative problem with pets and the noise and barking throughout the night is atrocious. The neglect is atrocious. I lived (shortly, let’s just say it got heated real quick when they gave me a pair of ear plugs - ps. Don’t ever give someone ear plugs if you aren’t aware they suffer from Tinnitus) to a couple who bought a beagle and subjected it to a 2 x 2 tiled out door square while they went off to their 9-5s. I’m honestly over how brazenly inhuman, we treat domesticated animals.

I write this to ask certain dog owners to go have a strong, hard, long look in the mirror and hope anyone living in condo/apartment living refrain from putting a living creature through such torment.

I have a barking dog problem, quite close to me and sadly I hear the only solutions and the yelps are just as deafening as the barks.

Owning a dog should be considered a privilege, not a right. 

If you need to feel that authoritative adrenaline run through your veins, go buy a digimon and find some friends to battle and if you own a dog that you’ve subtlety neglected I implore you to improve the living quality of the animal you’ve chosen to imprison."|brisbane|2020|True|0

"Bear with me, there’s no where for me to say this.

First, I want to acknowledge that scomo didn’t exactly ask international students to get out. He did refer to those who were unable to support themselves.

Okay, moving on.

I’m an international student at UQ. No I’m not from China, my uni didn’t pay for me to quarantine somewhere before flying in. 

I’m studying here not to get a citizenship, I have no interest in an Australian citizenship. I’m from a country where my application for an Australian student visa gets approved within 24 hours without any questions asked. 

I have a job waiting for me back home when I’m done with my degree. I have enough funds in my account to support myself for the next 12 months.

I would love to return home and be there for my family. But I’ve moved into an apartment with a 12-month lease, I’ve bought furnitures and I’ve settled in. It will cost be a bomb to go back now.

I have standard compulsory OSHC insurance and another comprehensive insurance that includes evacuation back home. 

So people need to stop saying all students should defer their education and go home. Not everyone can do that, not even me who is in a great financial position.

I love Australia and Australians. Most of you guys are absolute lads. 

But know that by constantly harassing and making fun of international students, you are adding extra stress on them. When my uni released a counselling service targeted at international students, a bunch of morons went on a shitshow asking us to leave. 

Also people who call us a burden. I was former military, if Australian hospitals/government asks for any help, I’ll be there faster than most Aussies. In fact I’m feeling like shit that I can’t help much. I’ve ran a few groceries run for quarantined folks but I want to do more. Put me in a hospital with the sick folks and I’ll still sign up."|brisbane|2020|True|0
"My son(13yr old) got tested positive for Valley Fever. Some history, if it helps. He has been having fever for the last 3weeks with a sore throat(Week 1), completely normal in Week 2(went to school, and participated in school band concert), then again fever with rashes this time in Week 3, and now week 4 with a fever, no rashes. Our pediatrician was suspecting it to be regular viral as Covid, flu, RSV tests were negative. seeing the rashes, she suspected it to be HSP(seeing the second set of rashes), but then urine and further blood tests were normal. We then went to PCH ER where they did further tests and it showed positive for mono and valley fever. His chest x-ray showed slightly enlarged lymph nodes.. So its week 4 now with a fever ranging from 100-102 managed by Tylenol/Mortrin.. no other complication so far(rashes have subsided, no sore throat), lost few pounds in 3 weeks and a a bit of headache when he moves.

ER doc called this morning and said Valley fever tests turned out positive. Asked us to talk to regular pediatrician. She is out of office for another 4 days. Called Valley fever clinic, they gave an appointment for May(5 months out) and said have the PCP call them if required before that. 

We are worried. Is there anything we need to do as a precaution while we wait for doc;s appointment.  Anything to watch out for especially for Valley fever in Kids? When should we panic and rush to ER? I don;t think I can wait for 5 months and have my son go through this hell. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated."|phoenix|2022|True|1

2:01 PM: The Governor begins speaking

Tonight is the start of the NFL draft so I'm flanked by helmets from both the Bengals and the Browns.

I'm also wearing a tie from Walsh University

While we're having physicians take another look at elective procedures that were canceled, there are still some issues with returning to these procedures in earnest. The supplies of PPE are simply not at a level that we want to be at and that requires conservation of the current supplies. Another constraint was a need to free up hospital beds and other spaces, although that issue is much less prescient now. We have  now decided to have physicians take a second look, after hearing about some patients not being allowed to do surgeries which would provide a major improvement to their condition. We hope to open up more as soon as we can.

Dr. Mark Weir will be giving a talk about our recommendations on social distancing and masks soon

2:12 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_____________________________________________________________
2:12 PM: The Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

We still have a lot of jobs you can apply for. It is up to over 50,000. We've heard lots of stories from friends and others that are taking the time to work for their community. 

Before Dr. Weir comes on, I'd like to say I really appreciate his contribution to our discussions during this crisis. His involvement has allowed essential businesses to remain operating that he was a part of developing. He's going to help create even better procedures in the coming days

2:16 PM: The Lieutenant Governor stops speaking

2:17 PM: Dr. Mark Weir begins speaking

COVID-19 spreads through droplets on surfaces and through cross-contamination. This virus is most typically spread through coughs and sneezes. 

We're working on interrupting the infection process by working together to limit contact with infected surfaces. For example, by wearing masks, many of the droplets are caught up in it like a shield. Along with this, washing hands will also kill the virus. 

One of the important parts of this crisis has been modeling. We've had to decide which models to use and how to use them to make policy decisions. This entire process requires the models to show a range of outcomes depending on how well people adhere to the guidelines. This can go down to a very low level.

Regarding social distancing, our recommendations come based on a lot of physics and other information that we have studied. Every time we talk, small amounts of droplets come out from our mouth in a cone shape that isn't very big. Coughing on the other hand deposits more and longer-range droplets throughout an environment. When we talk about this disease, those particles can travel between 6-10 feet, depending on temperature and other factors. This shows that even if you're wearing a mask, distance is very important. Social distancing is just another barrier, adding onto the masks.

The virus can last up to 72 hours on certain services without mitigation factors. Those factors include time of cleaning and type of cleaner used. In the air, in an environment that is very suitable for viruses, the virus can last three hours. Surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel are especially dangerous.

Air conditioning and heating systems can spread the virus through the process of re-circulation. Filters can prevent this issue. 

There are no perfect procedures we can do. What we can do is combine these procedures to lower the risk as much as possible.

2:48 PM: Dr. Mark Weir stops speaking
_____________________________________________________________________________
2:48 PM: Question period begins

Are you going to choose your own path or follow the federal government's plan?

Governor: We've spoken to the president and we are in complete accordance with what the administration wants. At the same time, this process will be an Ohio-based process. We'll be announcing our plan on Monday, with other information coming sooner.
_____________________________________________________________________________
2:50 PM: Based on new evidence that I feel shows that a lot of the danger is gone, why should we not simply open the state now?

Mark Weir: Much of that data is still based on limited information. This is a novel virus and our approaches must also be novel to respond to it. These decisions are always based on limited information and we're adjusting as we hear more. We're always asking the sort of ""What if?"" scenarios you are asking now. 

Governor: I have stated multiple times that there are a large amount of asymptomatic cases. The team has always felt that our case numbers are not accurate. Of course, this lowers the rate of death. This does not change the fact that the virus is contagious and dangerous to many high risk groups. This does not change the fact that many Ohioans have already died. We're trying to give people the confidence they need to get back.

Mark Weir: If we open everything all at once, everything we've done so far will be gone. You're inviting a peak to occur. You're allowing people who are asymptomatic to interact with people who were not infected. By making the situation more controllable, we can put in measures as necessary to prevent hot spots, or at least help people recover from within them. 
_________________________________________________________________________________
2:59 PM: I honestly have no idea what the point of this question was. Something about masks and something about increasing patients for the already burdened health care system. Seemed like two questions without any connection.

Mark Weir: I think everyone should do everything in their power to minimize your risk. Take responsibility and use your agency to do what you can.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
3:03 PM: What plans are there to protect dentists, while we still have a lack of PPE?

Governor: We need to balance the need for dentists to take care of Ohioans with the lack of our PPE. Everyone should be able to protect themselves as necessary. We're still not where we want to be with our supply of PPE.

Lieutenant Governor: Our standards are going to be very solid. They're going to be made with discussion with Mark Weir and following CDC guidelines.
____________________________________________________________________________________
3:05 PM: Why haven't you given out the business plan yet? Do you think you're giving enough advance notice?

Governor: I wasn't aware that we made it seem like we had it ready. We're still looking at where we're at in regards to testing and other important areas. We're still collaborating and reviewing everything before we can talk about the exact processes. These are significant decisions and they need to allow us to move forward, and not take any steps back.

This is a constantly changing situation so it does take some time to get information out. We give out what we know when we know it every day. We're relying on many teams throughout the state and the country to inform us on our decisions. We're doing everything we can.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:09 PM: At what point can Ohioans travel without necessitating a quarantine? Do you think it depends on how surrounding states are doing?

Governor: I wish I could give you an answer but we don't know that yet. This is something we'll have to deal with for some time.

I meet with many of our neighbors and we constantly compare notes and statistics regarding our situation. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________
3:10 PM: Are we setting parents up to make impossible decisions by sending them back to work without school reopening and without childcare?

Governor: This is a real challenge. Social distancing is very difficult for our children. They'll likely be fine by themselves but if they spread it throughout the class and then those children spread it to their families, that's a real hot spot and quick spread situation. If our businesses follow our procedures, their situation is far more controllable and will protect the workers and their customers from infection.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:13 PM: Are you going to continue to offer unemployment based on our current expanded rules as time goes forward?

Lieutenant governor: There are no plans to make changes to the current rules and expansions. The economy won't come back fast enough to get rid of them.
________________________________________________________________________________
3:16 PM: Is there anything the state can do to provide further help to our nursing homes?

Governor: We work with a team whenever we hear about an issue in nursing homes. We also give assistance as quickly as possible. We want to do more for them when we can and I hope we can in the near future. Congregant living sites are some of the most dangerous environments right now. Every nursing home is partnered with a hospital and they work together to ensure everyone is protected. This is a brand new system and I'm proud of it.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:18 PM: What factors are you looking into regarding reopening?

Governor: Our positive cases are lowering but we're still looking at that because they aren't lowering as quickly as we'd hope. 

We do look into hospitalizations and other factors. We are starting this process with the lowest risk. We aren't opening up completely. 

Lieutenant Governor: An important part of this process is looking at the successes internationally and within our state by companies that have remained open without much issue.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
3:22 PM: Can you talk about the budget, especially regarding the Rainy Day Fund and federal help?

Governor: We were talking about that today but we're not quite ready to share that information just yet. It's definitely raining but it's going to be pouring for awhile. We don't want to use the fund until we've exhausted all other options.  

We hope the federal government can help some of our departments due to the huge decreases in revenue we've seen.

3:24 PM: Question period ends

3:24 PM: The Governor begins speaking

Ramadan is beginning this week and fasting is an important part of that. We respect all followers of Islam and hope that Ramadan goes well for them.

"I’ve been critical of his and his team’s response since the beginning. My main gripes: The lack of transparency with their decision making ( you know the decided to keep kids out of school last week if not weeks ago, yet we hear it today), fiasco with unemployment, and not calling out failures from the feds. 

But in all honesty they are not bad. The measures implemented seem to be successful in stopping the shit from running amok. They, like everyone else have been patient with the shit. And gradually they have been calling out bullshit and their own  shortcomings. Still won’t get my vote for other reasons. But thanks for what yalls are doing.

"Hey all.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to see more and more mumps posts on here, so I wanted to make a post where I can easily find and answer any questions you have about the outbreak on Temple's campus.

&#x200B;

Here's some basic info:

*What is mumps?*

Mumps is a disease caused by a virus. People who have mumps can have swollen and sore cheeks and jaw, fever, headache, muscle aches, feel tired or lose their appetite. Most people feel better in a week or two. Some people with mumps may not even know that they have the disease. Mumps can occasionally cause serious health problems, especially in adults, like swelling of the brain or deafness. Some boys and men may develop swelling of the testicles.

*How does mumps spread?*

Mumps can be spread when someone who has mumps coughs, sneezes, or sprays saliva on someone else or an object that others touch. You can also get mumps from sharing utensils or cups with someone who has mumps. People who have the mumps can spread it to others two days before and up to five days after they start feeling sick. If you feel sick, stay away from other people!

*What should students do if they think they have mumps?*

If you feel sick with fever, headache, or have a sore jaw or swollen cheeks, you should stay home and away from other people. Staying away for five days will help keep other people from getting sick. If you still feel sick or your symptoms get worse, contact student health or your doctor.

&#x200B;

"I’m so angry writing this. My friend adopted her first dog ever from LoveJoy Foundation 3 weeks ago. She was told the puppy needed to be fattened up and couldn’t go home for a week.  She had a seizure in my friend's arms (a sign of distemper). After the first week she was told the same thing again - puppy was too skinny and needed to gain weight. Her and her husband visited the puppy and were devastated to hear it was not getting better and had to be put down along with the rest of the litter. The puppies were in an exposed pen and not quarantined from the rest of the other dogs.

My friend was told she could be refunded her adoption fee or put it towards another puppy from a different litter at the shelter. She decided to get over the pain of the first loss it might be best to get another puppy. She brought him home last Saturday (8/31).

I went to visit this puppy and he was obviously sick. The rescue said he had kennel cough and gave her medicine to bring home with him.

The medicine molded after 3 days. She brought him into the ER on Wednesday and turned out he had pneumonia. Vet determined the puppy was sick before she got him and exposed by the previous litter that was put down who were NOT QUARANTINED. My friend spent $660 on that vet bill. Then today the puppy took a turn for the worse and she brought him back in..: told he needed to be put into an oxygen chamber overnight. This cost my friend another THOUSAND dollars.

Despite all their efforts the puppy didn’t make it. My friend is devastated. Autopsy confirmed DISTEMPER - highly contagious and again, these puppies were not quaratined. Not only that, we believe the rescue lied about his age - he might have been 5 weeks old, NOT 8 WEEKS like they claimed. I want to burn them to the ground. They have many other puppies in danger. I don’t know what to do. Can my friend sue? She is so sad and devastated and I just want this place shut down."|LosAngeles|2019|True|0

"Good afternoon my friends! I was just put under my second quarantine for COVID-19 after a slight return to work and I though I might share my story so far to help paint a picture of what this situation has looked like for me so far. 

Some background: 24/Male; living in Linn County; working in the construction industry.

On Sunday (04-05-20) I came down with an extremely mild cough (I have allergies typically so I never think anything of light coughs). The next day I go to work still with the light cough. After \~30 minutes of time out of the house/at work I knew for sure I had something more (I hadn't gone anywhere or done anything except work and groceries for the last two weeks prior to social distance.) Just walking \~30 yards was leaving me winded like I ran a 5k.

At this point I called the doctor from my truck and was told to Self-Isolate until I was 72 hours healthy. 

The next three days following were by far the worst. Hours upon hours of laying in bed coughing; just waiting to get enough energy to get out of bed. The symptoms started to fade away and my fever was gone for 72 hours so I was able to go back into work yesterday (Wednesday). I was able to get through a full day, but I had an absolutely horrible pain in my left lung. This morning I called the doctor to confirm their statement was solid for me being non-contagious, but after telling them about how I was nearly collapsing from the pain in the lung I was referred to a respiratory clinic. 

It turns out the news articles about a second wave hitting if someone has a quick recovery were true, they landed on the idea that it's either an entirely separate infection taking advantage of my weakened immune system or it's COVID returning for a stint. Now I get to spend my 25th birthday this weekend trying to recover... Fun stuff

&#x200B;

What's the point of this post?

I'm sitting at home in self isolation for the second week in a row without any idea when I'll be free this time so I need something to do. But some key points to note:

* I never once have been able to get an actual test. I've spoken with family that works in healthcare as well as my standard doctors and they simply cannot test someone my age and in my career field. This is worrisome because I've been noticing more and more people at the jobs with small coughs or the occasional sneeze fits. I have no idea how many people are actually getting sick or not.
* Working for a family business does have its perks. Without any question, pause or doubt; my company paid me out for my missed time so far (even though I'm hourly). They've been constantly calling to check up and offered to deliver groceries, medicine, TP, etc if needed.
* A lot of the ""tough guys"" that aren't afraid of the virus are actually deathly afraid. The day I was cleared to go back in I received more shunning then a pedophile at a preschool.
* Last but not least: Your health is just as important to worry about as spreading the disease is. Even though I was cleared to go back to work I should not have gone. The doctors were saying that had I simply stayed home a couple extra days instead of putting stress on my body and re-exposing my weak immune system to whatever else can be floating around I would likely not be having as much trouble with this second infection.

Anyways guys; please be careful if you're in the Cedar Rapids area right now. I thought I was going to be untouched since I distanced and was outside all day, but it looks like those precautions weren't quite enough. 

Anyways, this has been my TED talk, let me know if you guys have any questions about what the process has been like so far in Iowa specific."|Iowa|2020|True|1

"MANDATORY SCREENING OF HEALTH FACILITY STAFF

SECTION SIX.   Pursuant to Iowa Code § 135.144(3), and in conjunction with the Iowa Department of Public Health, I hereby order all hospitals, nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, residential care facilities, hospice programs, and assisted living programs to screen all staff at the beginning of their shift for fever or respiratory symptoms, **absence** or shortness of breath, new or change in cough, or sore throat, take the employee’s temperature, and take any preventative measures based on that screening to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the hospitals, nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, hospice programs, residential care facilities, and assisted living programs.

"**For those of you who have wanted a COVID-19 test, but were rejected because you weren't high risk, here's an update.**

The changes allowed by the FDA are now reaching effect. National ""reference"" labs have started accepting tests and Iowa hospital systems are now sending lower risk tests to these labs.

Tests for higher risk patients meeting the state's stricter criteria will still go to the State Hygienic Lab in Coralville. These results are a bit faster and are sure to be no charge, even if you have no insurance.

If your doctor wants you to get a test and you don't meet the strict SHL criteria, then the clinic's send-out system will route it to the private national labs. If you have insurance, this should still be free. 

But, please... Trust your healthcare provider's advice. If he/she says you don't need a test, then just follow that advice. There is still a national shortage of some testing chemicals and supplies, so you doctor may feel you don't have enough risk to waste supplies getting a negative test just to make you feel better.

If you have a high risk person in your household, tell your doctor about that. It might be enough to push the decision over the line and get you a test.

**From the CDC:**

* Mildly ill patients should be encouraged to stay home and contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance about clinical management. 
* Patients who have severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, should seek care immediately. 
* Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness.

**[Testing Criteria from CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/index.html)**
---------
COVID-19 diagnostic testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in clinical laboratories. **This additional testing capacity will allow clinicians to consider COVID-19 testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients.**

Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Priorities for testing may include:

* Hospitalized patients who have signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in order to inform decisions related to infection control.
* Other symptomatic individuals such as, older adults and individuals with chronic medical conditions and/or an immunocompromised state that may put them at higher risk for poor outcomes (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, receiving immunosuppressive medications, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease).
* Any persons including healthcare personnel, who within 14 days of symptom onset had close contact with a suspect or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient, or who have a history of travel from affected geographic areas (see below) within 14 days of their symptom onset.

There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing. Documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction and known community transmission may contribute to an epidemiologic risk assessment to inform testing decisions. Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza)."|Iowa|2020|True|0

"Wall of text to follow, if you don't want to read it, basically if you've been stuck with CenturyLink as the only ISP in your apartment complex like me, consider signing up for the new T-Mobile One Plus plan and use your phone hotspot, it's way better than having to put up with CL and their mess. It's not meant for long term, but it'll help you stay connected until you move someone with Cox coverage.

If you're bored, keep on reading...

I don't know how many people here stay in the apartment complexes around Priest Dr, and have to put up with CenturyLink because that's the only service provider available, but I'm one of them and I'm sick of their incompetence. I've had the worst internet speed for the last 4 months, spotty connection and constant disconnects. And the time that it managed to stay connected, my toddler can't even go through a standard quality, 3 minutes nursery song on YouTube without it buffering for 2 out of 3 of those minutes. I'm paying them for 40mbps and getting around 10mbps through their own speed test site, called them numerous time to get a tech to come out to fix it, and it would be fixed for a day or two, then the speed would go back down again. I think they just come and switch out my wire with a neighbor or something to get the speed up, until the neighbor calls to complain about the speed, then they come out and switch that wire back to him, and the game repeats itself.

Their customer support is even more of a joke. Every time I call, all of the people answering the phone can't even comprehend a full sentence without me having to repeat myself at least 3-4 times. It takes me on average an hour and a half to even get to the point where we're both on the same page about the problem, then they either say they're gonna have to send out a tech, which takes another week or so, or simply that there's nothing they can do. They could care less about your problem and rectifying it is their lowest priority. 100% of the time I call to troubleshoot my internet connection, they'd try to offer me phone or TV services, without resolving the issue at hand. All they care about is upsell and cross-sell, and to get you off the phone as fast as possible.

But you're probably wondering what's with the rant? To make a long story short, at the beginning of November, I fell for one of their baits when they said that 60mbps was available in my area, and I do need the speed so I upgraded just to see how it is. Last week, I got my bill and it went from $43 to about $160. Once again I called and ask, they tell me that there is no promotion price guaranty package for the upgrade (basically their way of putting you in a contract for 12 to 24 months, and if you cancel before then, they'll just charge you an obnoxious amount of money in the last month), and also because of the upgrade, I essentially cancelled my 40mbps to move to the 60mbps, that's why I was charged a bunch of fees. I said I need to revert my account to the previous speed because I can't pay that much, especially with them not telling me that this would happen. My call got ""escalated"" to a specialist/supervisor. After about 2 hours on the phone explaining myself from the beginning every time I got transferred, I'm guessing they don't document anything you tell them, the escalation specialist told me she could either revert the account to 40mbps for $39.95+ tax OR she can keep the 60mbps but with a new 12-month price guaranty for $49.95+ tax (I thought they said there was no promo with the 60, but ok). I opted for the 60 since it seems to be the better deal.

I have a day job, but also do some work at home as a contractor, that's why I need reliable internet. So I came home last night with a stack of work to finish as I have promised my clients, but I found that my internet was down again. So once again, I got on the phone and they told me that my account is disconnected with no reason noted, except that there was a request to disconnect. I said I didn't put in a request to disconnect and please reconnect me so I can get some work done. They said they'd need to start a new account with a request for activation, and that would take a week with it being around Christmas time. That's when I said forget it, I'm done with CenturyLink, leave my account closed. Good riddance.

I called up T-Mobile to sign up for their T-Mobile One Plus, that's the unlimited high speed hotspot plan for $25 extra a month, and use my phone as an internet router. I was on the phone with them for about 15 minutes and got my internet turned on again right then, not a week later.

I doubt that my troubles with them are over though, I'm guessing they closed my account without telling me, and set up a new account somewhere and will probably send me a new modem and a bill for the new modem, along with activation fees, shipping and handling, and a bunch of other fees. I plan to call them today again hoping to ask them to purge my info from their system and never contact me again.

Anyways, sorry for the wall of text, but if anyone is in my situation of having to put up with CenturyLink, consider using T-Mobile as your temporary internet. It's not meant to be long term but it's better than CenturyLink.

I am scared what would my coworkers and manager would think if I take so much of sick leave . My sick leaves are not accumulated too so I don’t get paid too :( . 

Want to know if any one has this kind of cough that has been going on for a while and what did they do to recover it ? I heard it takes almost 3 weeks to recover . I drink warm water , cough syrup , take enough rest and sleep . But the itchiness in my throat is not something I can tolerate . My cough is so loud and harsh it hurts my lungs. My coworkers had it too but they were not as sick as I am . 

If I go to doctor they would say , drink water don’t get dehydrated , have cough syrup , rest well . No use

"TL;DR: Someone in the household is getting tested, doc says the whole house has to quarantine until results come back. My girlfriend's workplace won't let her leave. Anything I can do? 






*Massive Edit:* They are allowing her to leave after hours of arguing through text and on the phone. They said that she would be on a mandatory 14 day quarantine, regardless of test results, if she left work. 

The catch is that they are asking her to stay for 2 more hours because she is the only available person that can give medication. So they want her to touch the pills that are going into the patients' mouth (they don't have gloves)! When she asked them about that, they said ""you're the only one trained"" this place is a joke. 




So me and my girlfriend are living with my parents. My stepmom has become sick with a fever, and some other covid like symptoms. They are going to test her for the Covid-19 virus, but her doctor ordered that she and all people who have been staying in the house should quarantine until the results come back.

My girlfriend works at an assisted living type place where they have to be with their residents 24/7. I called her at work to tell her she should quarantine, but her workplace won't allow her to leave. They have been monitoring temperatures for a few days on all employees, and said as long as she doesn't get a fever she doesn't need to leave.

I feel that the company is putting their residents at risk by allowing someone who potentially is carrying the virus to continue to have physical contact with their residents (who are most certainly in the high risk category when it comes to Covid).

Is there anything she can do? She offered to provide paperwork from the doctor, but they ~~won't accept it~~ don't want her to send it. If she was to be fired, would that be unlawful termination? Any help is appreciated!

Edit: They are now telling her not to go home tonight, as if she has somewhere else to go, so that she won't be contaminated.

Hello, I am not sure this is the right place to post but I really need your help..

Where does she go first? Any help is appreciated and delete post if not allowed..

Update1: We contacted DHL and they said it will be fine to ship about 4 packs of her meds, we consulted the doctor and we're including a prescription and a letter explaining the situation, hopefully it will pass the borders, she has enough medicine to last another month till the shipment arrives or till we figure out Plan B

I see this as more evidence to support my claims that all oil based economies need to diversify. Immediately. 

*cough*Alaska*cough*

Technology is the only thing currently holding back the transition to clean energy. Yes we will still need oil but demand will drop. Can we really compete with countries that lack our safety and environmental stands? Especially price per barrel? 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-alaska-oil-bp/alaska-oil-producers-focus-on-efficiencies-not-70-oil-idUSKBN1F9027

The oil industry is already aware of this. How much longer will they try to compete, over easier grounds? 
Frankly, drilling in ANWR is an ecological nightmare based on luck. 

https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/arctic-wildlife-refuge-tax-bill-oil-drilling-environment/

That's a long article but a good read. Most interesting is the results of previous drilling expeditions in ANWR, particularly how little was produced versus the permanent effects on the landscape. 

Back to the first article. More and more clean energy is being found to be the best investment. I mean look at the Middle East. 

https://www.energycentral.com/c/cp/renewable-energy-cheapest-and-cleanest-source-electricity-oil-rich-gcc-countries

Solar and wind energy is already becoming profitable. The times are changing Alaska needs to find it's own way to survive in the quickly changing landscape.

Alaska was the Gold Rush. We can't ignore the obvious. Like warfare in the modern age, gold rushes are still occuring. It's technology not minerals this time. The result is still very much the same. Fortunes are won and lost. Look at Bitcoin and all that. What else would you call that? 

Back to Alaska. We need to diversify our economy. I dropped out of college twice, but I like what this person is selling. 

https://www.adn.com/voices/article/alaskas-lopsided-tax-rates-unfair-everyone/2014/12/31/

We have other industries we need to begin monetizing. The longer we wait the harder recovery will be. Balance the budget, pull multiple revenue streams. Apply the excess oil money into education and infrastructure. 

How many people have horror stories dealing with UAA transferring credits and the likes? Alaska needs a real technical University equally emphasizing trades and degrees.

Why don't we incorporate MORE apprenticeship programs into high school curriculums? You can graduate with a college credits, why can't you graduate a journeyman?

Build on job corps. Make Alaska where they send you to learn a trade. See just how many skilled workers stick around. 

With our remote populations we'd be the perfect state to test some form of online k-12 education. Isn't the point of common core education? Adaptability to the needs of the student? I watched this YouTube video about education recently, it got me thinking of schools as more than just building.

https://youtu.be/mc4vNEj49NU

Also the similarities of school buildings to factories. Remote online education would allow kids to get quality educations while never loosing their roots. Contributing to their tribes learning traditions from their elders side by side with the skills they need to succeed in the outside world. Imagine the unique minds an upbringing like that would produce? The best of both worlds. 

I was lost once. Two things saved me. My mother's love and an abritrary decision to move home (AK) versus back to Phoenix. I recognized my need for roots. They give me strength.

I mean I'm not the only one who sees the trend and chased the money South.

 I currently live in a townhome style condo which is ideal for me as a single mid 50s female. Unfortunately I’m hyper sensitive to secondhand marijuana smoke coming in from neighboring unit.

The other tricky thing is I want to be within 45 minutes of the town of Fairfield and like so many posts before me, I’d love a walkable area.

"UPDATE:

Omicron is a highly mutated version of the virus. Through genome-sequencing, we can actually visualize what a big leap this is from previous variants.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t4yy90hvnj281.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=885b8ab4023b91fd247f436129c8a5cd9d6c212c

Compared to the original Covid virus, Omicron appears to have over 30 mutations to its spike protein, which is known to be important in evading immunity and increasing transmissibility.

We can tell that Omicron is not a descendant of Delta, or any recent variant, but rather appears to link back to a strain of Covid that began much earlier in the pandemic. That means that Omicron has had an extended period of time in which to mutate, finally emerging as a distinct variant approximately eight weeks ago.

At this point, there are two main concerns.

First, there are early signs of heightened transmissibility of omicron based on how rapidly it’s spreading. Omicron has rapidly overtaken other variants in South Africa. Across the country, infections have tripled in the last week.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o5a8rb4ynj281.jpg?width=809&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea5a196c2d4828be4466bb4f6fcaf5ad93a2134c

That could be due to some unknown superspreader events that happen to involve this new variant, or it could be that the variant itself is simply much more contagious.

Second, there’s a possibility that Omicron may have some level of vaccine resistance based on its mutation profile. As the president of Moderna said, “What’s most scary about this virus is it’s managed to put all of its greatest hits into one variant \[Omicron\], and then has added maybe 10 mutations that we don’t even know what to think of yet.”

While we know that some of the infected were fully vaccinated, the data on Omicron’s potential vaccine resistance right now is basically anecdotal. That said, it’s highly unlikely that this new variant can simply defeat the vaccine. What’s more likely is that the vaccine isn’t as effective against it, while still being our single best defense.

The U.S. has relatively low rates of people receiving their booster shots, in part because the C.D.C. did not actively recommend that people get their booster shot and simply told people that it was an option. Only 20% of adults in the U.S. have had a booster shot.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3kjly4w0oj281.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=57e672a80253edc8dd7a327d084022c804c3a2ce

It’s important to note that, as of last Friday, *all adults are* [*now eligible*](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/covid-19-boosters-for-all-discussion-moves-cdc-2021-11-19/) *for a booster shot.*

Japan and Israel have completely closed their borders to non-resident foreigners. The U.S. has implemented a more limited travel ban. That said, there is no real confidence that travel bans will be anything more than a speed bump for transmission, especially given that the variant already has confirmed cases in Canada, Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Netherlands, Portugal, and Scotland. Notably, the case in Scotland does not appear to have originated from overseas travel, but rather appears to be community spread.

There are no confirmed cases in the U.S., but New York has already [declared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/27/new-york-omicron-coronavirus-variant/) a state of emergency in anticipation of Omicron’s arrival.

This is everything I know right now. I take seriously my responsibility to get out good information as quickly as possible so that you can see what we’re facing and act accordingly.

I will keep you posted.

I've been posting like crazy lately looking for guidance/advice and suggestions.  
this will be my last post and it will be a long post so buckle up as im lost as a motherfu...

Bit of backstory: Been working in telecommunications doing rodding and roping/civils/cable hauling all the fun laborer stuff for the last 5 years, I'm 23 now and even before corona virus I've been thinking 'what the f am i going to do, this is so dead end'

this week rolls around and we get made redundant, pretty inevitable at this time. So now I have the options of do I study, or go back to being a laborer for $30 p/h for the rest of my life. Im in a good situation living at home with my parents with my partner where I can go to uni and be financially okay..

I've been looking at courses to study, nothing really piqued my interest ...  
i'm sort of worried about working in an office I guess as I've worked outside my whole life, I'm fairly intellectual so I don't have a problem in whatever course i decide to do, i'm more worried at the prospects of jobs following the degree..|

Some of the degree's/courses I've looked at are:

* Business (Management)
* Computer Science
* Diploma of Project management - (i'm worried that this alone wont have any job prospects)

Another option crossing my mind is becoming a mature age'd apprentice doing Electrical (working with comms transitions nicely to this) and it's still like laboring except it's a career with good future money to be made.  
Problem being its incredibly difficult to get a mature age'd apprenticeship especially during corona virus :( if anyone knows anyone in brisbane, or has any tips id love to hear them.

I feel so lost and confused, I know i';m only 23 but i want to start working towards whatever I do RIGHT NOW. I don't want to wait any longer. I stress every single day trying to figure out what it is that I want to do that I feel like i'll never find it.

"I'm positive I'm not the only one who feels this way but I want to post my frustrations so that just maybe something will change.. Highly unlikely but

I'm on a very fixed income of my SSI/and my VA compensation, I will never be able to work and therefore I have to look for ways to better provide for myself.  I was already collecting SNAP for the past 10 yrs or so, I had a routine I would do every month to survive here in Hawaii.  June 2023 rolls around and I receive a notice saying I make too much to stay on SNAP and that my benefits would be discontinued, that I could refile again if I would like, and I did, at the first of July 2023, and for almost the entire month of July I would call for a status update and so forth, and if I was lucky I got 1 callback telling me that I'm scheduled for a phone interview on the 26th of July, I called the number, followed the instructions, waited 1 hr and 15 mins on hold for someone to answer and no one answered, I was given an option to leave a message and someone would get back to me, then 2 days later I received not 1 but 2 denial letters because according to the notices I failed to call for my phone interview.

I bitched about it and someone calls me 2 weeks later, we go over everything I was required to submit except for a couple medical bills and therefore I was still over the income limit.

I'm just beyond pissed/depressed right now, I only have my SSI and VA Compensation, but they apparently count that as earned income ( I don't understand the reasoning behind that since I served our Country and received disability rating of 80% and paid into my Social Security while I did work) but the reasoning behind it was beyond stupid.  Like this entire state of Hawaii so fucken expensive, and cares less about how the Kupuna, as well as families in general survive to get food.

I'm sick of this and just wish I could find some resources to move away from Hawaii, I have given up over 30 plus years of my life thinking things would get better here and its just been the opposite.

All over the place I’m seeing headlines like “popular tourist center burned to the ground” or “trouble in paradise” or “vacations up in flames” and its starting to drive me crazy. Tourists are getting interviewed on the news, and every comment or post across the internet feels like someone going “oh my god, I had my honeymoon there two years ago!” Or “Is it still okay to come to Maui?” Where are the locals? The people actually affected by this tragedy? It feels like such a spit in the face to those of us that actually lived and worked in Lahaina. It’s all fucking gone now and it’s still being treated how it’s always been treated; like an amusement park that exists purely for the entertainment of ha’oles instead of a place where people actually live. Even after 36 confirmed deaths so far, probably all of locals, all anyone seems to care about is that their favorite toy got taken away. Oh god, what if a tourist got hurt?

Commentary: Yes, looks like we right in the middle of a surge.  Bear in mind that this ""surge"" most likely won't be like any of the major increases we've had before.  But cases are definitely up here and across the country.  So maybe be a bit more careful if you're going to see kupuna or someone sick soon.

Looks like there will be a new booster coming out end of September, which will probably be a little too late.  (My complete guess is that we peak in about a month)  But oh well. 

If you do get it, try to get some Paxlovid.

"^(Sorry this one's coming in on short notice, but I've been pretty sick lately so please forgive me.)

# Happy Pre-Christmas holiday season!

Before everyone heads out for their thanksgiving / friendsgiving plans, come join us for this month's meetup at The Garage! There will be bowling, billiards, beverages, and... other food / drinks / activities that don't start with 'b'. 

Come waste all that extra money you'll be saving on those pesky 'car tabs' and 'supporting public transit infrastructure' on meaningless short-lived activities that benefit you directly and immediately instead! 😢

# Details

Friday, November 22nd - 19:00  
The Garage - 1130 Broadway, Seattle, WA 98122 

#  Notes:

* **This venue is a bar, so unfortunately this meetup is restricted to the 21+ crowd.**
* The meetup's official start time is 19:00, but I believe The Garage has / had a daily happy hour from 3-7 if you feel like showing up early.
* Bowling and Billiards are optional, and pay as you go. It'll work best if you find a few other folks to split a lane or a table with.
* I'll edit this if it changes, but we currently don't have a dedicated reservation, so I'll update / post in here once we find our spot.
*  /u/SodaAnt wins a free beer for helping pick the title (another reason to [hang out on discord](http://discord.gg/invite/fBu3Qn5)).
* If you have suggestions for future meetups - please join our discord (link above) or feel free to shoot me a message!"|seattle|2019|True|0
"We're coming from Manhattan where we could both hop on a subway with a door to door commute of 20-40 minutes despite working on opposite sides of town. Seattle doesn't seem to be as well-equipped public transit wise. Google maps doesn't seem to be very reliable for estimating commute times so I figured I'd ask the locals!

Pretty important: both of us get REALLY bad motion sickness on buses and while sitting in traffic. (trains, subways, planes, etc are fine though). So living somewhere to reduce or eliminate time spent on buses or sitting in traffic would be ideal.

We'll be renting a 2 bedroom apartment. Area itself doesn't matter as long as it's safe. Budget will be in the $3500-4500 range. Thanks so much for your help. Can't wait to be a part of your beautiful city!"|seattle|2019|True|0
Hello, my current lease is ending and I’m weighing my options. I’m considering signing for an apodment purely because I’m sick of roommates and want something somewhat cheapish. But I’m curious as to what’s its actually like living in one. Is the noise pollution tolerable? Are the communal kitchens used often? Is the WiFi they provide slow? Any input would be appreciated, and thanks in advance :)|seattle|2019|True|0
"I am truly sick of it. It’s that time of the year again. I am sure others are seeing this too. Whoever lets them into my apartment building fuck’em.

I don’t know if I threaten to call the police they leave. Everyone knows police response times is a joke at this point.

I just tell them “yeah I vote sawant” to get rid of them. Now they say ALL AMAZON EXECS MAXED OUT $500 TO OUR COMPETITOR to collect donations.

Anything we can do about it?"|seattle|2019|True|0
"Seattle cop here, throwaway account. Long time lurker, first time poster so sorry for any bad reddiquette. There’re a lot less cops in our communities than civilians, and even less on the internet, so we don’t really get heard here. Usually, I don’t think it’s worth my time to speak up because I don’t think anyone actually wants to listen, but at this point I’m willing to try anything.

Like a lot of you, I’m frustrated, sad, hurt, discouraged, heartbroken. I’m part of the newest generation of cops, which means I chose this job despite the turmoil. I knew what I was up against. And that’s part of the reason I’m here – because I want to change things. I want things to be better, I want to help. So it’s really disheartening to have people online and in my face telling me what a terrible person I am for choosing this job. I know the whole criminal justice system is fucked up. That’s. Why. I’m. Here. And I do everything I can every day to make things better, to have my voice heard.

One of the biggest flaws I’ve recognized is officers’ terrible history of not communicating with the public. We should be telling you about this job, what we do, why we do it, what to expect from us. We should be telling you stories about 911 calls, the good ones and the terrible ones. I’m so tired of people eating up all the misinformation. I am working hard to change that by trying to push out more information about policing in Seattle and about the cops that do it, but that’s pretty time consuming, and my primary job is responding to your 911 calls on the night shift. Plus, over the past week, I have only had time to sleep and work since we’re on an emergency staffing schedule.

I would love to answer your questions I hear on the protest line about why I do this job, am I proud of what I do, am I a racist, is my name Karen, am I recording, how do I live with myself, do I care about George Floyd, why do I beat up queer people, do I think it’s ok to use tear gas, etc., but during a protest is not the time. When I’m on the line, I am trying to be aware of what’s happening around me 360 degrees. I am listening to my radio, which is going non-stop. I’m looking for the instigators, the people who show up just for the violence. I’m worried about myself and my coworkers being the targets. I don’t have time to answer your questions. Because believe me, I would love a chance to speak for myself. To not have you just assume the answers to all those questions.

Because I am, as are all of my coworkers, a free-thinking person. I am a proud Seattleite, who was born downtown. I grew up in West Seattle and went to school on Capitol Hill. I left for 12 years, lived in other states and overseas, and then couldn’t wait to get back to the city where I felt most at home. To be surrounded by like-minded people. But the city I came back to was not the same city I left. And I was raised with the mindset that if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem, so I became a cop. I, like almost every other cop, joined because I want to help people. I wanted to help my city by helping make SPD better. I didn’t apply to any other cities, and I’m not going to be cop anywhere else. Someday I may stop being a cop, but I have no plans to stop being a Seattleite.

I know you think most of us live in the suburbs, and by the numbers that’s probably true. But it doesn’t mean we’re not part of the city. Think of all the thousands of people in other fields who work here or own a business here who don’t live here. Or people who regularly visit Seattle for the art, the music, the shows, the sports, the views, their friends. We all contribute to the state of this city.

Also, I know we’re mostly white males, and that’s not great, but we’re working on that too. We’re trying to hire more women and BIPOC. And really, the white males I work with are actually pretty great. When I call them out about microagressions, they don’t brush me off or retaliate, they listen and they say – you’re right, that was fucked up. And – brace yourself for this one – they’re not racist. Most of the younger white people will admit to their privilege and acknowledge their implicit bias. And while less of the older ones are willing to do so, at least they are learning about it through mandatory training.

Because of the hiring spree we’ve been on, the makeup of the department is really changing.  The younger generation of cops that I’m a part of is more progressive, more diverse. We are men, women, gay, lesbian, straight, trans, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, liberals, conservatives, libertarians, nerds, gym rats, lifelong Seattleites, first generation immigrants, black, white, brown, bilingual, non-native English speakers, introverts, extroverts. We’re as young as 21 with three months on the job, or close to retirement after more than 30 years. Some of us live outside the city so we can have more space for a large family, save money on real estate, or have a farm. Some of us live in the city because we’re city people, we hate long commutes, we feel at home in a proudly gay neighborhood, or our spouses work here. We miss going to restaurants, we listen to NPR, we watch Fox News, we have tattoos. Some of us have many guns, some of us only have the one we carry at work. We are artists, singers, foodies, feminists, runners, hikers, video game players, college graduates, veterans, Jews, Christians. We’re not perfect – we speed, we jaywalk, we talk shit about our coworkers, we complain, we make mistakes. (All of the things I listed in this paragraph describe actual officers I know, they’re not just random examples.)

And we’ve made a lot of mistakes lately, in my opinion. Police are trained that we need to have the upper hand, to have control of the situation at all times, for safety. And in a lot of cases, that’s definitely true. So it’s really hard for us to stand down, regardless of the circumstances. I think a fair amount of the criticism of our crowd control tactics is warranted, and I think policies are going to change after this. But if you’re protesting, you have to remember that you can’t see if people 30 feet behind you are hurling rocks, or if someone else just pulled a Molotov cocktail out of their backpack. But we can see those things, and we tell each other instantly on our radios, and we react. I’m not trying to make excuses for times we escalated things when it could have been avoided, I’m just providing you with our perspective. And part of our perspective is shaped by fear. Yes, that’s right, we’re human and we feel fear. We’ve learned to handle and manage and push through it (what I would call bravery), but it’s still in our minds. When other officers are assassinated on the street, when their precincts are burned down, that impacts our actions because we’re now on high alert. The irony of that statement is not lost on me, because I know black people have been living with being afraid of being killed in the street for generations, and I will not pretend to know their experience. But I do know what it’s like to wear a uniform that is like a target. I don’t have any police stickers on my car, I never wear or even display my uniform when I’m commuting, and I lie to my neighbors about what I do for work.

I don’t want to be out there in my riot gear. It’s hot, heavy, cumbersome, uncomfortable, and I think it sends the wrong message. What I really want to do is just talk with protestors. But I would rather wear that helmet that gives me a headache than get hit in the face with a rock or a firework – both of which have hit me, but thankfully I wasn’t injured. Other officers have not been so lucky. We’re taking rocks, bottles, cans, fireworks, frozen water bottles, and mortar shells. We’ve had numerous cuts, scrapes and bruises, plus more serious injuries like broken ankles and bone contusions.

Again, I know many of you think officers shouldn’t be complaining about our injuries because A) we chose this job, B) we're also using harmful tactics/weapons, and C) because this whole movement is about the many who have suffered so much worse for so much longer. Agreed. But perpetuating violence is not the answer – and I’m saying that to both sides of the line.

I know there are many officers that support BLM, who acknowledge the institutionalized racism in policing, and who support changes to address those issues. Honestly, I can think of a lot of reasons why cops would love the defund the police movement (as long as it doesn’t take away our pay and benefits). We didn’t become police to deal with people in mental health crises; we would love to have mental health professionals address those calls. We would love to see more comprehensive health care solutions so those with mental health needs can get long term help, not just 72 hours at Harborview. We’d love to have SFD respond instead of us to any call that is medical in nature. We don’t want people sleeping in encampments, we want them housed. We want people with debilitating drug and alcohol addictions to have the resources to kick their habits and get their life back so they can contribute positively to society. If those things got taken off our plate, we could focus on serious criminals. Plus, overall crime would go down, which is also fine with us. We’re not worried about working ourselves out of a job.

But that’s a really complex, multifaceted idea. It involves so many different government and private entities. Which brings me to one of the issues that I think is really bothering officers right now: yes we need to deal with our institutionalized racism, but it’s not just us. We don’t want to be the scapegoat for this issue. Of course, we need to recognize that racism in the law enforcement system can be life threatening, but we’re not the only ones who need to answer up. Every citizen who has voted down funding for education and social services in the past, and governments that have mismanaged/ineffectively used what funding they have, are also responsible for systemic racism. I won’t be surprised or offended if SPD’s budget gets reduced and put towards things that support BIPOC, but personally, I think we need to be demanding more financial support (read: taxes) from huge corporations and the ultra-rich. But I digress.

So what next? Talking, communicating, discussion, planning, action. I want to know each other better. I will come to the table with humility, an open mind, and a readiness to listen without defensiveness.  I’ll be doing everything I can to promote community, understanding, and equity, and helping to change the system from within. Not all of us will talk to you on the line, but some of us will. Go to a quiet place away from the biggest group and try to start a conversation. We’re so tired of getting screamed at, we’ll welcome a calm, rational chat. And if you are in that big group, police yourselves and get those people who are throwing shit to leave. I think we can all agree they’re detracting from the cause (unless your cause is assaulting police, in which case I can’t believe you’ve read this far and my message for you is cut that shit out).

I know this post has been a little all over the place, but that’s an accurate representation of my mind and my heart right now. I know it might seem like an avoidance tactic to post this in the middle of the night, but these are my usual work hours, so it’s normal for me. I’ll stay logged in for a little while longer to answer any respectful/reasonable questions/comments.

I love you Seattle.

EDIT: My laptop is dying and I have to go to sleep, but I'll try to get to more comments later today or tomorrow. Thanks to everyone who has been civil.

EDIT 2: Oh man, this is a lot to wake up to. Thank you so much for the awards, it means a lot to get even fake internet points right now. Thank you again for everyone that contributed productive feedback or respectfully shared their opinion. If you left a question I'll still try to get to it, but it might take me a while.

My wallet got stolen last night and my license was in it. Unfortunately, because of covid, the DOL offices are closed. There’s an option to replace your license online but I think there’s an issue with the site because it says it can’t validate my information even though they are only asking yes/no questions... probably a website bug. 

No call lines for this type of support is available... I need to be able to drive and this headache has been the cherry on top having my wallet stolen.

"This is NOT a shaming post, so ‘not at all’ is a perfectly acceptable answer. Im strictly talking differences NOW from the before times, now that things have largely settled. Ive noticed three differences myself:

1: I always mask on the T and flying

2: I always mask while working my part time job at a local theatre (just given how many older folks see shows there)

3: If I sense that I have ANY symptoms of cold/flu/etc, I wear a mask everywhere as a precaution to avoid spreading to others."|Boston|2023|True|0

"I noticed there wasn't any in depth guide on this anywhere online, so I decided to make one. 

 If you're looking for an alternative to our wonderful abundance of overpriced beer gardens this summer... whether you go with 4 people or 40, river tubing is a foolproof way to have a great time with a group of friends or family on a budget (unless it rains...that'd kind of suck...but still an adventure!...unless theres lightning....that just sucks.)  

There are 2 main rivers in the area people usually go to tube. The Delaware and Brandywine. This post is going to be about the Brandywine specifically....but both are fun! I've done this trip several times now, and found theres no good resource to figure out logistics if you've never been down there before. So I'm making this as detailed as possible to hopefully save some headache (and to reference myself in the future).

Before doing this yourself, be aware you CAN go through a tubing/canoe outfitter company. Doing so will probably save you some money & hassle. They'll rent you a tube,  and bus you up to the starting point, so you don't have to drive at the end.  All in will probably cost you $20-$30 with tube rental.  You can even bring your own tube and pay them $10 just to use their busses.   This is a good option if you want to do this planning & headache free.... probably best bet for a family trip, or if you can only wrangle up one car for the group. But, its also possible to DIY the whole trip if you want to do your own thing, plan a longer float route...or have some beers along the way (which imo is the best way to tube). 

If you’ve never tubed before, the concept is pretty simple. You jump in the river. Float on your tube for a few hours. Then get out of the river downstream. While simple, its an awesome way to relax, have fun with friends, enjoy the sun, and see some great nature/scenery. 

If you are planning to drink (and for the purposes of this post I'm assuming you are), you *can* of course try to sneak alcohol onto one of the outfitter busses, and likely won't have a problem doing it. But its an extra risk since they all have strict no alcohol policies, and you'll be around a lot of kids/families. 

**Note** Alcohol is officially illegal on the Brandywine (it’s probably illegal for tubing on most rivers ). Bring at your own risk, don't be stupid, and make sure to plan for a DD!

Here is a route map I put together which I'll go over later. https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=12ZmOO8kDgf0RgUPiccC6-reUE5PZhCoJ&ll=39.84181667906422%2C-75.56566535197754&z=13


*****************
**Required Supplies**

- Tube: The most important part. You can get a tube for $10-$20 via walmart/target/amazon. Anything that floats will work...you can get a legit ""river tube"", or something fun like a flamingo or giant donut. Recommended to find one with a cup holder! Don't bother spending lots of money...but I wouldn't get one at the dollar store or 5 below, as they do need to hold up for several hours. 

- Spare Tube: This is more a pro tip than mandatory. I recommend buying a cheap extra tube for the group in case one deflates along the way (this came in handy personally when my tube died after hitting a branch!). You can tie this to someone elses when you float. Worth $10 to prevent being up shits creek without a paddle... so to speak.

- Cooler: You'll want to bring a cooler for drinks, or even some snacks along the way. There are 2 options. Bring your own cooler, and an extra tube to put it on (They make tubes [like this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-28-qt-Cooler-Float-with-2-Cup-Holders/47423692?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222227037388137&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=92173193537&wl4=pla-183830721377&wl5=9007324&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=47423692&wl13=&veh=sem) specifically designed to float a cooler , or you can rig something up on a regular foat.). Alternatively, you can buy an actual floating cooler [like this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Intex-Inflatable-Mega-Chill-II-Cooler-Float-48-x-38/22061250). Either works!

 - Dont forget ice for the cooler!

- Paracord - paracord is basically long, thin rope. You'll want this to tie the cooler/spare tubes to one of your floats. Or you can tie your whole group together in a big party ~~rape~~ **holy crap, Edit...raft...I meant raft!**.  Can be found in the camping section of Walmart for a few bucks or anywhere online. 

 - Don't forget a good knife for the paracord! It can be a bit cut to cut through. 

-  Booze: Officially, having/drinking alcohol is illegal on the Brandywine, and the cops/rangers can fine you pretty big if they want to screw you over. So I'm not officially condoning it here. But I will say that tons of people manage to do it without problem.. But if you do decide to do it, you should try to be discreet. My recommendation is to buy a big insulated tumbler or large cup...fill it with plenty of ice, and make a tasty mixed drink (Rum & Fruit Punch Always great for a day in the sun!).  If you bring cans, then either plan to pour it into cups/bottles, or use a coozy that hides the drink. Be respectful to others in the river, don't make a scene, clean up your trash, don't drive drunk...and you probably won't have a problem.

- Water: very important to bring some water bottles in the cooler so you don’t end up like /u/angsty_potatos ... drinking + sun all day is a dangerous mix... drink it even if you don’t feel thirsty. dehydration is no joke 

-  Trash bag: Don't be a dick and litter in the river!

- Electric Air Pump: Trust me, you'll want one for those big tubes. You can use an air mattress pump that have the narrow fill nozels. 

- Dry Bag: You'll want something to put things you need to keep dry like keys, cell phones (if you want to risk it), etc. Can be a plastic bag, or any waterproof container you can easily tie.   

- Sunblock: You'll be baking all day

- Lunch: Bring some food, you'll get hungry after a long day of tubing. Even an easy snack for the river is a good call. There are plenty of good spots around here to set up a small portable grill!

- Sandles or Water Shoes: You'll want something protecting your feet while tubing. The bottom is rocky and you may have to do some walking at points. 

- At least 2 vehicles: You're going to be parking one car at the route exit, driving everybody upriver, and parking the other car(s) at the entrance. After the float, the car at the exit will drive the other drivers back upriver to get their cars. 

- Optional...Waterproof speaker. Alternatively drunk tubing acapella singalongs are always a good choice. 

Pro Tip: We always make the mistake of trying to buy everything the day of the trip. When you're with a group of people this always takes way longer than expected and adds a lot of stress, so I highly recommend just getting everything ahead of time if you can!

********************
**Routes**  

The Brandywine river flows through PA & Delaware. Its especially great for tubing because its pretty slow, lazy, winding and partially shaded. There are several main routes people do. Any of them work depending on your distance preference or how the parking situation is the day of the trip.

Most of the routes I know start around Chadd's Ford, PA (about 45 minutes from Philly), though they're around the PA/Delaware border...and some of the parking lots are in DE. 

******************
**Route 1**  Exit at [Smith Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/ebms3PR8yyM2) or [Thompson Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/8nWyfDzJsyN2).  Entrance at the [Brandywine River Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/5sDX1kQzQDL2). You can park the exit cars at Smith's bridge lot, right on smith's bridge road(see map I posted)... its free, but gets crowded. Theres a nice picnic area you can grill at. 

The float to Smith's Bridge is about 4.5 miles, and will probably take you 3-4 hours depending on the river current that day.

If you want to extend the trip you can also exit at Thompson's bridge...which is about 1.6 miles further downstream (prob an extra 45mins - hour or so). Theres a lot there that cost ~$8 to park.

I will say I've never actually done this route (though know its one of the most popular)...from what I hear the River Museum charges $20 to park in the lot. It can also get full up pretty quickly.

******************

**Route 2** Exit at Thompsons' bridge or Smiths Bridge; Entrance on [Creek Road](https://goo.gl/maps/wxhMtUuHpLQ2).  We did this the first time we went because all of the parking lots were full up.  Exit is at Thompson's Bridge (or Smith's if you want a shorter trip.) 
After parking at Thompson you're going to dive up the road a ways, theres a bend in the road past smith's bridge (but before the river museum) where theres room off the side to park, and an entry point to drop in. Its a bit hard to find if there aren't any cars there... this is the exact spot (https://goo.gl/maps/wxhMtUuHpLQ2)

The route to Thompson is ~4.8 miles total...again roughly 3-4 hours. Probably the perfect time for most floats.
If you want a shorter route you can get out at Smith's...~3.3 miles total. 

If the paid Thompson's lot is full up or you want to save a few bucks, theres also some free parking up the road in the state park [here](https://goo.gl/maps/MqLLifj6ReR2)  ....just gotta walk a bit from the river. This spot is between Smiths & Thompson.

******************

**Route 3** Exit at the [Brandywine Creek Dam](https://goo.gl/maps/4LLXKfWTxGR2); Entrance at Smith's Bridge.

The parking lot by the dam is part of Brandywine Creek State park (off Rockland Rd). Its a pretty small lot, and the entrance to a bunch of great biking/hiking trails.

This Route is ~3.1 mi, so shorter than the others. However, the river current starts getting pretty slow after Thompson, so its still probably a good 2.5-3+ hour float. 

*Make sure you get out before the Dam or you will die! Don't worry, you'll hear it coming from a while away. Just don't try to go over it!*  
          
Be warned, theres muck along the bank where you get out. Float as close to the edge as possible before you get out of the tube or you'll be shin deep in mud!

**Super Short Route** Smiths Bridge to Thompsons Bridge.  This would be a really short trip...about 45mins-1 hour. But good option if you're down there bbqing/hiking/biking/we and you want a quick and easy float. 

************************
**Weather/Water/Timing**

Be aware, the parking lots can get very crowded some days, especially holidays. Plan to get there ideally early AM and be a bit flexible. Alternatively you can plan to go a bit later in the day after people start clearing out. 

Make sure to be out of most of these lots before sunset...or you can get a ticket.

The water is usually warmest around July/August.  The river can be pretty shallow if it hasn't rained in a while. You'll be able to stand up for a lot of the trip. Check the water levels before you go to make sure you won't be sitting on the bottom the whole time.

You can check live river conditions here: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?01481000

**Pro tip**...if you want to make it a really great trip, find a campsite in the area and do a combined Tubing/Camping adventure.

Probably about it. Have fun!

"My wife and I just postponed our Christmas trip to KC this year due to the rising COVID numbers. It was a difficult decision and resulted in a lot of hurt feelings within my family. My brother who lives in KC and is, shall we say, not convinced of the seriousness of the virus and has open disdain for wearing masks, is furious at us. 

We live in Colorado and almost everyone here (except rural areas) wears a mask and takes this pandemic seriously. My question is, what is it like in KC right now? Are people masking up? How are the infection/hospitalization numbers looking?  I’m just looking for an unbiased general assessment on the situation of anyone is willing to offer one up?

I told them “no thanks” and turned around and left.

I hate to be “that guy” but I want to report this. A barber shop or hair salon not wearing masks is just asking to rampantly spread the virus.

I am concerned that people are putting so much faith in the numbers and that we are waiting for another case of confirmed community spread to take further protective measures when the stats we are basing these decisions on are limited by very few tests, results are trailing multiple days behind, and we are not even targeting testing for community spread (a big reason I was able to get a test was because my exposure abroad put me in a moderate risk category). 

Please pay attention to the warnings coming from Italy and don’t take unnecessary trips out. I know everyone is saying this but prevention now will allow us to get through it faster and will save lives.

"I really want to be a preachy dick about this, but that isn't what anyone needs to hear right now.  I'm keeping things as vague as possible in case she reads this post.  I don't want her to suffer any more than she already is.

One of my inlaws is a die hard Trump supporter who would make fun of anyone wearing masks and was quite vocal about how stupid I and others were for taking Corona virus seriously.

Her daughter was an immune compromised teenager.  She was at the children's hospital when a certain Utah jazz basketball player visited earlier this year.  Her Facebook was jubilant about her sick daughter getting to meet and touch and interact with this certain basketball player.  My in-law said we were all being overzealous about the risk her daughter faced.  For months this in-law has been mocking everyone wearing masks, going out in large gatherings, and pretty much giving zero fucks about Covid-19.

Her 14 year old daughter just died from covid.

This is not a joke.  I'm dead serious.  I know a lot of us can feel anger toward the people not talking covid seriously.  One of them just paid the most terrible price for her arrogance and stupidity.  No mother should be burying their teenage daughter.

I hope she comes out and starts encouraging people to take covid seriously.  I doubt she will, and I don't want to give her the I told you so treatment.  I just want people to please take this seriously.  It isn't a joke.  It doesn't affect just the elderly.  We can reduce the spread of the disease.  We know how, yet people are willing to risk their own lives and that of others for political grandstanding.  

Living intelligently isn't living in fear.  Taking precautions against covid and other diseases isn't cowardice or terror.  It's being smart.  Here's another example of being smart: you don't raw dog a prostitute, you wear a condom (or don't engage in the risky behavior to start with).  Wearing a mask is like wearing a condom when engaged in a risky behavior.  It doesn't completely mitigate the risk, but it can help mitigate negative outcomes."|Utah|2020|True|0
"My wife and I bought a kitten for $5, but it turns out she isn't super socialized. The result is a kitten that is litter box trained and actually really friendly to the other cats, but runs the minute we get too close.

I tried KSL classifieds, but have not been successful. We will keep trying to work with her as we can until we find someone.

**INFORMATION ON TESTING**

5/21 note - Huntsville Hospital announced this week it was going to start making more tests available to the public but hasn't announced the when, what or how. I will update when that information is available. There are some private urgent care places that are offering testing as well.

**Coronavirus has no cure. The only medical intervention available for advanced cases requiring hospitalization is to manually help your lungs function if you are getting overwhelmed and struggling to breathe. Unless you are in need of respiratory support and very ill, stay away. If you have a cold or are sick, stay home. The other people in your home need to stay with you.**

**If you are looking for testing, there are is the Fever & Flu Clinic:**

**[Huntsville Hospital COVID-19 Testing Clinic](https://www.huntsvillehospital.org/fever-flu-clinic)** opened 3/18/2020 at 120 Governors Dr.  It's open Monday - Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM.  

This is the [handout](https://old.reddit.com/r/HuntsvilleAlabama/comments/fla9ny/if_anyone_wanted_a_peek_at_the_paper_they_give/) you receive when you arrive with the details.  

The clinic is recommended for children and adults ages 6 and older who exhibit a broad range of upper respiratory illnesses, including influenza, sore throat, strep throat, fevers or potential exposure to COVID-19.

You will NOT be tested for COVID-19 upon request.  You MUST have had clinical signs or been exposed.

**ALABAMA STATS**

[Alabama Department of Public Health Latest Report - 17,952 infected; 803 cases in N. AL](https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7).  Yesterday's count was 17,359.  54 additional cases in N. AL consisting of Jackson, Limestone, Madison & Morgan counties.  Fun fact!  That's the highest single day increase for our region to date!  Bonus fact:  Morgan county is doubling cases on a 10 day frequency right now.  AL's fatality count is 630 confirmed deaths.

[Q1](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=865) \- KCCI - Iowa’s getting remdesivir (potential treatment drug) - A) When will it be here? B) How will it go?

“We got remdesivir over the weekend”, “…Dr. Pedati and the public health team. They will put the parameters together… based on who benefits the most from the drug.” 

Answered A, but only vaguely answered B. This drug is [""not a cure""](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-gilead-sciences/u-s-to-allow-states-to-distribute-gileads-remdesivir-to-fight-covid-19-idUSKBN22L0SM) and its efficacy as treatment have been moderate and yet inconclusive.

\-------------

[Q2](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=924) \- RadioIowa - Will you allow the public health emergency proclamation currently in place to expire on Friday, or will parts of it be extended in counties?

Kim “I’ll be making an announcement tomorrow…”, “Iowans have been incredibly responsible.”, “We are seeing businesses be very thoughtful and cautious about how they start to reopen their business so they can provide confidence to their customers”, “We can continue to lessen the restrictions.”

Non answer. 

\-------------

[Q3](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=1028) \- Based on what you know now, do you think you should have worn a mask during Friday’s event? Should more Iowans be wearing masks? What’s the state’s formal recommendation on wearing masks?

“Well there’s great guidance that’s been provided by the dept of public health… I’d stress all Iowans go to [coronavirus.iowa.gov](http://coronavirus.iowa.gov/). You can see there where all the guidelines are at. There’s guidelines for businesses, for churches, for individuals…. I did have a face-covering with me but we did practice social distancing the entire time. I think that’s part of the recommendations from the dept of public health…if \[practicing social distancing\] is not possible, if you have a face covering with you, to go ahead and put that on.”, “I trust Iowans. I trust them to do the right thing.”  
   
True but misleading - Kim says her not-wearing a mask was fine per Iowa's recommendations. This is true. Iowa's recommendation of [only](https://idph.iowa.gov/Portals/1/userfiles/7/COVID-19%20Guidance%20for%20Cloth%20Face%20Coverings4_6_20.pdf) wearing a mask if distancing practices can't be adhered to while in public seems to conflict with the CDC's recommendations in support of [always](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) wearing a mask in public.

\------------

[Q4](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=1111) \- Channel 5 - How did Iowa get on the short list for getting the first shipments of remdesiver?

Sarah “Our understanding is that Asper did some analysis based on current case counts. They looked at areas of the country where case counts had increased over the last seven day period… so our phone call with them was… last week.”

Unverifiable answer. The [federal administration](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-gilead-sciences/u-s-to-allow-states-to-distribute-gileads-remdesivir-to-fight-covid-19-idUSKBN22L0SM) has not yet specified why certain states' requests for this drug were honored and others weren't. Meanwhile, POTUS has publicly advocated for [partisan-dependent federal support](https://nypost.com/2020/05/05/trump-blue-state-coronavirus-bailouts-are-unfair-to-republicans/) for states.

\-------------

[Q5](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=1167) \- KWWL - RE: Far northeast Iowa, Allamakee county. There’s cases believed to coming out of Postville and Agristar meatpacking there. What can you tell us about testing there?

“The reason you’re seeing a tick up in the increase of positive cases is because we did one of the strike teams. We sent a strike team to Agristar, like we’ve done in many other of our manufacturing and processing facilities.” It helps us “provide some confidence to employees to start to see the scope of the virus activity within the community and within the plant. Identify those that are positive. Identify those that are negative. Separate the shifts. Help the employees that have tested positive to begin a road to recovery, and then as they work through the timeline that they need to recover, then, again, they have the confidence to return back to work and to return in a safe environment. Making sure that we’re providing the the PPE that they need, and that the businesses are doing what they can to practice social distancing” temperature scan, assessment, to see if they’re experiencing any symptoms, to separate the breaks, the line that they work on to as much as possible provide the social distancing there as well. So it’s a combination of all of those. I think it was last week that we sent the strike team up there.”

Seemingly true. There has been more recent testing around manufacturing and processing plants, but this comes [weeks](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/05/05/coronavirus-infects-thousands-iowa-meatpacking-plant-workers-covid-19-waterloo-perry/5170796002/) after the State Auditor called for it. It's worth remembering here that the processing plant in Postville has a history of exploiting undocumented labor and fraud, using [ICE](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/07/30/postville-iowa-immigration-raid-documentary) to prop up their abuses. Their former CEO, convicted of fraud and money laundering, was [pardoned](https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/president-trump-pardons-jailed-chabad-icon-rubashkin/) by the current administration who claimed the sentencing was ""excessive"" and ""harsh"". 

\-------------

[Q6](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=1281) \- What about school start dates? Should there be an Iowa State Fair this August? Do you plan to take any actions halting these and county fairs or will that decision be left to local leaders?

“It’s too early to make that decision.”, “If we can continue to see some of the positive signs that we’re seeing, especially on the eastern side of the state where we’ve done extensive strategic and targeted testing, where we’ve seen the numbers go up but we’ve also seen them come back down. We’re seeing the hospitalization trends start to go back down. We’ve certainly been able to manage the resources so we don’t overwhelm the hospital systems. So now we’re doing that similar type of testing in central and western Iowa. So you can see over a 7-14 day turn around you can see some significant changes. Some positive changes in the trends. We’ll continue to monitor the information that we’re receiving.”

Non-answer.

\--------------

[Q7](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=1383) \- Can you tell us more about your daily testing regimen? What process? How long before results?

“Yup. So before even moving into a modified quarantine, every day... every person would have their temperature taken and asked if they’ve exhibited any symptoms. So now I’ll not only be taking my temperature with a thermometer everyday in the morning and throughout the day”, “Everyday before I come... I’ll be tested”, “We get the results back in 10 minutes” zoom calls & working from home.

Seemingly accurate.

\------------

[Q8](https://youtu.be/CM0vOx0br10?t=1467)  \- Sarah just mentioned that the case trends up-ticking over the last 7 days is why Iowa qualified for the treatment drug. What is your response to Iowans who want to know why we’re seeing more restrictions ease given the up-tick in cases?

“Yeah. Yup. Well it’s because of that very testing that we have the opportunity with Dr. Pedati when we were at the WH to talk w/ Dr. Bircs. She wasn’t aware that we were doing extensive targeted testing and a lot of our manufacturing and processing facilities. So they were very impressed with the testing, not only the diagnostic, but the serologic that we’re doing as well. Especially with the case investigation and the contact testing, she really, uhh, commended us on our ability to do that as well. So once we put it into context with what we had been doing in the state she said that explains some of the increase and the numbers that we were seeing…”, “So, you know, we were able to explain that. That’s what we were able to explain to Iowans. Just like we saw at some of the facilities in the eastern side of the state.”, “So you see a fairly high uptick in positive cases. What we’re also seeing, and I’m anxious to see some more results of that, is some trends and data from the serologic testing… b/c so many Iowans have been asymptomatic and that really helps us speak to the data that says that 80% of iowans who test positive for Covid19 have mild or little to no symptoms at all. It’s the 20%, older Iowans with underlying conditions, that are at most risk. And that’s really who we need to be focused on. And no matter what we do when we ease restriction, our recommendations will continue to be to those vulnerable Iowans, to continue to stay at home & limit exposure.”, “They didn’t have the context when they were sending out the remdesivir”

Contradictory answer. It's true that increasing testing inflates positive numbers. Reynolds used increased positive cases to secure the untested treatment remdesivir, while simultaneously claiming a decrease in positive cases to justify loosening restrictions.

\-------------

Q9 - IPR - How many contract tracers do we currently have working across the state? How many should the state anticipate?

Sarah - “150 members of the nat’l guard. …We’ve given counties the opportunity to turn over their case investigation to the state.”, “In all of the other counties they are staffing for contact tracing locally and so, my understanding is that many of those local health agencies have brought on additional staffers to do that work… we also have a team of epidemiologists at the state health dept.”, “We also have a partnership with the dept of human services… between 20-30 of them.”  


Answered first part, not second.

\--------------

Q10 - DSM Register - So if WH staff and officials are being exposed to this virus still, how can essential workers and people being called to work feel safe that they’re not being exposed?

“We have to practice personal responsibility” We’ll continue to open up more testing. “The same recommendations apply that have from the very beginning. We can never guarantee that Iowans won’t get it.” Those w/ underlying conditions need to stay at home. “People need to, if they’re sick, stay at home…”, “I think employers, you know if you can work from home, they’re going to continue to, should continue to allow you to continue doing that if possible.”

Non-answer. Iowa has offered nebulous protections for workers and [ranks poorly when compared to other states](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-05-05/unemployment-benefits-up-in-the-air-for-high-risk-workers-as-states-reopen). The state's guidance here absolves businesses of liability while pushing responsibility to individuals. Depending on employers to protect workers without firm government mandates is naive at best (see Triangle Fire, Chris [Hedge's](https://www.npr.org/2012/08/02/157813661/drive-for-profit-wreaks-days-of-destruction) recent book, Iowa's [water](https://apnews.com/45bae286d2e246f594a996499bed776c) quality, etc)

\---------

Q11 - AP - Last week you spoke of Iowa having the capacity to test 5,000 people per day. When will the state be able to hit that mark?

“We’ve done really good the last couple weeks. We were almost at three or four, 3,100 last week. We’re really close to getting Test Iowa validated. That’ll be a significant piece…”, “The state hygienic lab has been doing yeoman’s work managing the number of tests we’re sending to them.”, “I want to give a heartfelt thanks for what they’re doing at the state hygienic lab.”

Non answer.

"I work in a grocery store, we were supposed to be one of the first groups to get vaxxed but due to most of us being in our 20s we ended up, at the last second, being the very last group to get it. And since so many people were making appointments at once, many employees are still between shots or waiting for their first. 

Yet, we are now being made to serve older people who got pushed ahead of us and now think that it's totally safe to go into crowded grocery stores maskless. 

Just be considerate. We're very close to
having more than half the state fully vaccinated, but most grocery store employees and retail workers are not yet. We've already had so many breakouts of the virus in our store and it's incredibly taxing on everyone here. Please continue to wear your masks in grocery stores and other crowded indoor shops with young employees, regardless of your vaccination status as you can still spread it to us. 

I understand we're all excited to take our masks off, but I just wanted to get this out there as I think most people simply haven't considered us. Thanks.

edit: i'm not sure why so many people who apparently agree with my point are arguing this. i'm just asking people to be more considerate of the fact that retail employees are not all vaccinated and that it is not yet safe for us for everyone to be going maskless. if you agree with that, then we're on the same page, that's all i'm saying."|Connecticut|2021|True|0

At this moment I'm in east Denver, and my sinus problem has gotten slightly better, now at a more familiar level of symptoms and intensities. I got my flu shot 2 weeks ago and will take a covid test when I get home, because of its well-known effect on people's sense of smell.

Sadie needs someone to love and to love her and a safe and understanding place to live. Most of her life has not been a happy one. She was abused and abandoned, and she was on the streets for a long time. She was frightened and skinny and sick when she was taken into the Wichita Animal Shelter. With so many puppies needing adoption, she was passed over and was soon scheduled to be put down. 

We adopted her and since then we have given her love and security and medical care. She is chipped and spayed and has had all of her shots. She has been treated for heartworms and is healthy. She had a lipoma removed from her shoulder and is now a completely healthy lady.  The vet thinks she is 7-8 years old. She is a Rottweiler mix and has a gentle demeanor. 

We have not seen any aggression toward anyone or any other animals. She is a snuggler and cuddler and just wants hugs and to be around her owner. She has been learning how to play and be a dog and be less fearful.

Because of her time on the streets and the rough treatment she encountered there, she sometimes has separation anxieties if left alone for very long. If you want a sweet and loving companion dog and can be patient and help her with these anxieties, you should meet Sadie. 

It breaks our hearts that because of our job, we can no longer give Sadie the care she needs. If you’d like to meet Sadie, please let us know. We will bring her to meet you someplace safe at your convenience. You will fall in love with her immediately. Please see her photos "|Wichita|2023|True|0
"My bf and I moved into waters edge apartments almost a year ago. While living here we have had working heat/ac for all of 4 months (lease is up end of July) we have been dealing with this bout of fucked up heat/ac since the beginning of march and they have done nothing. Two weeks ago our fridge went out bc it couldn’t keep temp bc of how hot the apartment is. I am type one diabetic and my insulin expired without my knowledge bc of this and I was hospitalized for 4 days. I have contacted the housing authority and Kansas legal services and they have been little help. They are supposed to be coming today to fix it and I just don’t know what to bc the fridge is starting to not be able to keep temp again and there is supposed to be a heat wave today and tomorrow. Also the heat is causing me to have chronic low blood sugar and I just feel so sick all the time. We will be moving out and already have a place secured once our lease is up but we just can not continue to live like this for the next month. Would just like some advice on how to take action against or get someone higher up involved to force them to fix it TIA


EDIT: I just got back from the office and finally got to speak to the property manager (claims she’s there M-F 8-5pm but this is the first time I’ve been able to speak with her) she says my work orders have been being closed without them coming (duh I told you that) and she also hasn’t been told about this situation at all by any other leasing agent. She said someone should be coming today or first thing in the morning so we shall see.

"If this formats weird it's because I'm on mobile. I'm not sure where else to post this somewhat anonymously, but here goes. 

I'm a nurse. All of the local hospitals are short staffed and treated like shit from upper management. We aren't able to provide the best possible care because we're so short staffed that we have such high nurse to patient ratios that severely limit the time we have to provide the bare minimum expectations of our job. You as patients suffer and it's dangerous for everyone. New grad nurses are getting short, inadequate training because there simply isn't enough time and not enough staff.

The thing is, everyone in upper management knows about this, they just don't care. 

Wesley’s staffing on 6/3 was that all ICUs 6 or more nurses were tripled. They are supposed to be one nurse to one patient, MAYBE two depending on acuity. They had three extremely critically ill patients. Remember- the ICU is where the sickest of the sick land and require the most monitoring and care.

The medical surgical units, where most admissions typically land depending on what's going on, they were flexed to 8 patients to 1 nurse. According to National Nurses United, a safe ratio on a med-surg floor is 1 nurse to no more than 4 patients.

We all work 12 hour shifts, so if we have 8 patients, we are only going to have 1.5 hours max for each patient in a day. That's 1.5 hours to do everything - meds, helping with basic activities of daily living, taking vital signs, and monitoring you in case your condition changes and you need either a different plan of care, or require more close monitoring and have to be shipped off to the ICU. Never mind that you as an individual person need to be educated on what's going on, you might be scared and lonely, your family might have questions, the doctor has questions, if your toilet is broken we have to fix it, your sheets are dirty we have to change them, etc etc. Plus getting yelled at and physically hit by patients and families. All of this falls on one nurse for eight different people. Let that sink in. Wichita sadly isn't alone in this either, it's all over the country. 

Our community deserves better. Our nurses deserve better. 

We are exhausted and burnt out and begging for help that is falling on deaf ears because profit is the only thing that matters to these hospitals. Nurses are trying to unionize at Ascension, but there's no guarantee that'll improve things either. 

I guess this is partially a rant but also a cry for help, and also to alert the community of the BS that goes on in the background of healthcare here. Talk to your community leaders, write emails to the CEOs of the hospitals, the senators, anyone that will listen. If you find yourself in a hospital as a visitor or patient, please just be kind and give some grace to everyone."|Wichita|2023|True|0
"Hello parents, tis is I, a Highschool student in the glorious shitshow that is the Oklahoma City Public School district, and I wanna be the one to say.. this fucking SUCKS! Like Jesus christ, everything  that could suck about the structure of our schools  was made possible. Our school administration can’t do or won’t do anything about the rampant drug problem in our bathrooms, students are failing to do basic fucking math despite being in fucking Highschool (which is not an issue on their end). 

Don’t even get me started on the fucking drama amongst our teachers, like seriously dude, forcing a teacher to quit their job because they couldn’t do anything about the students ditching in their classroom? Writing them up for “contributing to an unsafe environment?” Despite being told multiple times about the issue?  I know the fucking superintendents aren’t blind to these issues either, and Honestly Im getting sick and tired of this shit. 

So that is why I am calling on you guys, you see the school districts don’t take us seriously because we are still school students, so why would they? We are BEGGING you guys to start demanding change from these bastards because we are suffering just as bad from their lack of inaction.

I've put together a letter to send to the Superintendent of my child's school district and I'm sharing the template here for anyone else who is sick of Walters pushing his BS agenda.

Dear Dr. [Superintendent's Last Name],

I am writing to express my concern about the potential showing of a video featuring Ryan Walters praying for our country in the classroom. As a parent, I do not agree with the inclusion of this video in a public school setting. I believe such content has the potential to create division and fear among students, which is not conducive to the inclusive, respectful environment we expect in our public schools.

While I understand that various viewpoints are part of the fabric of our society, I feel that the inclusion of a video that could be perceived as endorsing a specific political or religious agenda is inappropriate for a public school setting. I do not blame the teachers or staff for this, and I want to emphasize that my concern is not with them personally but with the content being shown to the students.

As such, I am requesting that my child be excused from viewing this video if it is shown in the classroom. I remain a strong supporter of our public schools and teachers, and I want to ensure that the learning environment remains neutral, focused on education rather than political or ideological divides.

Thank you for your understanding and attention to this matter. I trust that the district will make the appropriate decision to respect the diverse perspectives and beliefs of all students and families.

Sincerely,

**Increased Patient Volumes in Emergency Departments Straining Vermont Health Care Systems**

Respiratory viral activity and nirsevimab update

**BACKGROUND**

A surge of  respiratory illness is straining health care systems across Vermont. To  help reduce this burden, clinicians can encourage patients to remain up  to date on vaccinations, test and treat for respiratory  illnesses appropriately, and remind patients to avoid others when sick.

In Vermont,  significantly increased activity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),  along with co-circulation of influenza virus, rhinovirus, COVID-19, and  other respiratory viruses, is causing a high incidence  of respiratory illness. This surge of illness is straining health care  systems across the region, causing bed shortages, staffing shortages,  and long wait times for medical care.  Long wait times in Emergency  Departments have been attributed to high patient  volumes in inpatient settings, both in hospital inpatient settings and  in long-term care and behavioral health facility types.

**REQUESTED ACTIONS**

**Providers and Healthcare Facilities**

Primary  Care Practices and Urgent Care Centers should consider communicating  availability of office hours outside of normal business hours (extended  hours and weekend hours for sick  visits) to patients and provide information related to the types of  injuries and illnesses appropriate for primary care or urgent care, , as  alternatives to an Emergency Department visit.

Long  Term Care Facilities or Congregate Living Facilities who have access to  in-house medical care should prioritize on-site medical care whenever  available and indicated. If on-site  care is not available, consider Primary Care Practices and then Urgent  Care Centers, before Emergency Department Level of Care.

Consider  the use of Telehealth as a resource for patients who may be effectively  seen in a virtual setting and when in-person options are not available  or necessary. Telehealth may  also be available for physician consult in some cases.

**Vaccinations**

All eligible Vermonters should stay up to date on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations.

&#x200B;

* Walk-in clinics remain available, with expanded weekend and evening hours to accommodate a variety of schedules, namely  families with school-aged children. 
* Everyone 6 months and older is recommended to receive an annual influenza vaccine. 
* Everyone  5 years and older who has gotten their primary COVID-19 vaccination  series is recommended to receive the COVID-19  bivalent Omicron booster. These booster shots are widely available, and  studies indicate that they are highly effective against currently  circulating Omicron variants. 
* Given  the recent increase in nirsevimab supply and the manufacturers’ plan to  release an additional 230,000 doses in  January, CDC advises healthcare providers to return to recommendations  put forward by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  (ACIP) on use of nirsevimab in young children. Infants and children  recommended to receive nirsevimab should be immunized  as quickly as possible. RSV activity remains elevated nationwide and is  increasing in parts of the country.

&#x200B;

* &#x200B;
   * All infants aged less than 8 months and children aged 8 through 19 months at increased risk of respiratory syncytial  virus (RSV), are recommended to receive a single dose of nirsevimab. 
   * Pregnant  people 32 through 36 weeks gestation should receive RSV vaccination  through January. Pfizer Abrysvo  is the only vaccine recommended for use in pregnant people.  Administration of both nirsevimab and RSV vaccination for pregnant  people is not needed to protect most infants.

**Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions**

Staying home while sick, masking and other measures can help keep others safe.

&#x200B;

* All persons with acute respiratory symptoms should stay home while ill, especially students and those who work in health  care, child care or long-term care, even if they have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies. 
* All persons with respiratory symptoms should wear a mask and practice social distancing when around others.
* People may consider masking and social distancing when around young children or medically-vulnerable people. 
* All persons should cover their mouth using a tissue or bent arm—not their hand—when they cough or sneeze and should  wash their hands frequently throughout the day.
* Infants  under the age of 6 months are most at risk for severe RSV disease.  Families of young infants should be counseled  to practice good hand hygiene. Types of contact that increase the risk  of RSV transmission to infants include holding, kissing or touching the  hands or face of an infant. These types of contact should be limited to  essential caregivers as much as possible  during RSV season."|Vermont|2024|True|0
"In June 2021 Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda [announced legislation](https://council.seattle.gov/2021/06/28/councilmember-mosqueda-to-recognize-diversity-of-seattle-neighborhoods-with-zoning-name-change/) that would rename single-family areas in Seattle to neighborhood residential. This plan was criticized by some for being an incredibly unsubstantial change and that the council should just do the real work of legalizing multi-family housing citywide. [This Reason article](https://reason.com/2021/06/29/seattle-is-proposing-to-get-rid-of-single-family-zoning-in-name-only-literally/) criticizing the change includes [a tweet](https://twitter.com/sydneymiyahara/status/1409630226678620163) that Mosqueda actually responded to. At the end of her response Mosqueda says

>[Changing Seattle's zoning policies is an often frustratingly slow process, and we are making sure that we're laying every brick necessary to take on exclusionary zoning in the major Comprehensive Plan update.](https://twitter.com/CMTMosqueda/status/1409651434925084674)

The Reason article and most other criticisms of this change are very surface level and do no digging into why Seattle City Council (SCC) cannot immediately legalize multi-family housing citywide. The first thing to dig into is what is the comprehensive plan.

# What Is Seattle's Comprehensive Plan

The [Office of Planning & Community Development](http://www.seattle.gov/opcd) (OPCD), responsible for creating and maintaining the Comprehensive Plan, gives this answer on their [Comprehensive Plan initiative page](http://www.seattle.gov/opcd/ongoing-initiatives/comprehensive-plan)

>The Comprehensive Plan is a 20-year vision and roadmap for Seattle’s future. Our plan guides City decisions on where to build new jobs and houses, how to improve our transportation system, and where to make capital investments such as utilities, sidewalks, and libraries. Our Comprehensive Plan is the framework for most of Seattle’s big-picture decisions on how to grow while preserving and improving our neighborhoods.

This does give a good, very high level overview of what the Comprehensive Plan is but does not answer why the plan exists. Why is answered with multiple parts.

# Washington's Growth Management Act

Seattle's Comprehensive Plan and other comprehensive plans in the state were created after the Growth Management Act (GMA) was passed in 1990. The GMA is codified under Revised Code of Washington (RCW) [Chapter 36.70A](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A). The [stated intent](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990ex1c17.pdf?cite=1990%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2017%20%C2%A7%2013) of the GMA was and still is

>The legislature finds that uncoordinated and unplanned growth, together with a lack of common goals expressing the public's interest in the conversation and the wise use of our lands, pose a threat to the environment, sustainable economic development, and the health, safety, and high quality of life enjoyed by residents of this state. It is in the public interest that citizens, communities, local governments, and the private sector cooperate and coordinate with one another in comprehensive land use planning. Further, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest that economic development programs be shared with communities experiencing insufficient economic growth.

The [current abbreviated goals of the GMA](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.020) are as follows

>The following goals are adopted to guide the development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW [36.70A.040](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.040). The following goals are not listed in order of priority and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development of comprehensive plans and development regulations:
>- Urban growth
>- Reduce sprawl
>- Transportation
>- Housing
>- Economic development
>- Property rights
>- Permits
>- Natural resource industries
>- Open space and recreation
>- Environment
>- Citizen participation and coordination
>- Public facilities
>- Historic preservation

How does the GMA concern Seattle and its comprehensive plan? Seattle is required along with King County to create and maintain a comprehensive plan according to RCW [36.70A.040](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.040)and is required to review its plan to stay compliant according to the schedule in RCW [36.70A.130](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.130). In the past the schedule has always been a part of the GMA but the schedule has been updated by the state legislature. Counties and cities were first required to comply by [July 1, 1993](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990ex1c17.pdf?cite=1990%201st%20ex.s.%20c%2017%20%C2%A7%2013) and update their plans every 10 years. This deadline was [extended by one year](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1724-S.SL.pdf?cite=1995%20c%20347%20%C2%A7%20106) to 1994, the year Seattle [adopted its first comprehensive plan](http://clerk.seattle.gov/search/ordinances/117436). The next update mostly stayed on schedule, being due [December 1, 2004](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5841-S.SL.pdf?cite=2002%20c%20320%20%C2%A7%201) but the reviews were accelerated to happen every 7 years. Seattle met this deadline with the [2004 Comprehensive Plan major update](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPCD/OngoingInitiatives/SeattlesComprehensivePlan/SeattleComprehensivePlan.pdf). The next update did not happen in 2011 and instead was moved in 2010 to [December 1, 2014](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6611-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%20216%20%C2%A7%201) and then moved again in 2011 to [June 30, 2015](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1478-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20353%20%C2%A7%202) with an 8 year update cycle. Seattle met this deadline with a [set of updates in 2015](https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2400782&GUID=CFA51897-124F-4487-8B55-9B7F495507F1&Options=&Search=) but finalized the major update in 2016 with [Seattle 2035](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPCD/OngoingInitiatives/SeattlesComprehensivePlan/CouncilAdopted2020.pdf). The next scheduled update is as follows

>On or before June 30, 2024, and every eight years thereafter, for King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties and the cities within those counties

OPCD and SCC are aiming to update Seattle's Comprehensive Plan by the 2024 deadline but that could change if the deadline gets moved by the state legislature. Note that, however, counties and cities can update their plans before the deadline.

>(6)(a) Nothing in this section precludes a county or city from conducting the review and evaluation required by this section before the deadlines established in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. Counties and cities may begin this process early and may be eligible for grants from the department, subject to available funding, if they elect to do so.

So it still seems like Seattle should just be able to legalize multi-family housing but the GMA includes requirements which seem to slow down the update process. First, according to RCW 36.70A.130, comprehensive plans cannot be updated more than once per year. Also the city must consider

- [RCW 36.70A.100](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.100): Comprehensive plans—Must be coordinated
- [RCW 36.70A.140](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.140): Comprehensive plans—Ensure public participation
- [RCW 36.70A.210](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.210): Countywide planning policies

# VISION 2050

Before we can get to the county level plan we have to learn about the regional plan. According to the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) [site](https://www.psrc.org/about/what-we-do)

>PSRC develops policies and coordinates decisions about regional growth, transportation and economic development planning within King, Pierce, Snohomish and Kitsap counties. PSRC is composed of nearly 100 members, including the four counties, cities and towns, ports, state and local transportation agencies and Tribal governments within the region.

PSRC creates and updates multi-county planning policies which are published as VISION, the most recent one called [VISION 2050](https://www.psrc.org/vision) which was adopted October 29, 2020. VISION was first created in 1995 with VISION 2020 and was updated in 2008 with VISION 2040. These multi-county planning policies then go on to inform the county level policy. Seattle is located in King County and the county policies are called the King County Countywide Planning Policies.

# King County Countywide Planning Policies

According to the [county website](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/executive/performance-strategy-budget/regional-planning/CPPs.aspx)

>The Countywide Planning Policies (CPPs) create a shared framework for growth management planning for all jurisdictions in King County. The CPPs implement the Washington State Growth Management Act and the VISION 2050 Multicounty Planning Policies, adopted by the Puget Sound Regional Council in 2020. The comprehensive plan for King County and city comprehensive plans are developed from the framework that the CPPs create. Countywide Planning Policies are being updated in advance of the 2024 periodic update of comprehensive plans to reflect a number of changes to the regional policy framework and to reflect new priorities addressing equity and social justice within our communities.

Here is a simple [slide from the county](https://kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/executive/performance-strategy-budget/regional-planning/CPPs/2021-CPP-Update/Draft_CPPs-Targets_Website_presentation.ashx?la=en) that shows what feeds into city level comprehensive plans.

[A slide showing the Growth Management Act informing Multicounty Planning Policies which informs Countywide Planning Policies which informs the Comprehensive Plan which informs the Zoning Code which informs Development / Construction](https://i.imgur.com/devPl1g.png)

The requirement to coordinate with other counties and cities restricts Seattle from making large changes, like legalizing multi-family housing, without forethought.

# Legalizing Multi-Family Housing in Seattle's Comprehensive Plan: Some History and the Future

## 2015: A False Start

This is actually not the first time Seattle's government has tried to update its housing laws to increase density, housing affordability, and legalize multi-family housing citywide. Most recently back in 2015, when Mayor Ed Murray's administration was working on the major update to the comprehensive plan for 2016, the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA) committee [considered recommending getting rid of single-family zoning](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/get-rid-of-single-family-zoning-in-seattle-housing-task-force-says-in-draft-report/)

Here is a long quote from a leaked [draft letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2159033-hala-co-chair-cover-letter-draft-8-1.html) from the committee co-chairs.

>**MORE HOUSING**: The inescapable reality is that everyone in the City of Seattle needs to make room both for newcomers, as well as those that have historically been excluded altogether from the housing market altogether, including individuals and families who are homeless. We've all got to slide over and make room at the tables of our many communities. That means more cottages and in-law apartments and flats and duplexes and triplexes and roommates and rooming houses in the two-thirds of Seattle currently zoned exclusively (and, historically, for purposes of exclusion) for single-family neighborhoods.  
>In fact, we don't even think they should be called single-family neighborhoods anymore. It means prioritizing housing over free, on-street parking spaces. It means phased upzoning of areas in and around Urban Villages -- more 6 story building where there were 4 stories before; more 7 story buildings where they were 6 stories before; and more multifamily housing of all types in areas currently zoned for less density inside Urban Villages or very close to desirable urban amenities. An increasingly dense city also must have access to a robust transportation system, one that gets people out of their cars and using public options to move to and from work, school, and community activities.
>
>In short, it means that our city will not look like what we're used to.  But that’s been the story of Seattle from its birth.  Our city’s physical form will change so that our character and values can stay the same: We can only hold onto our commitment to inclusion, opportunity for all, and affordability if we let our city fill in with more housing. We can still be a city for everyone, but only if we give up our outdated ideal of every family living in their own home on a 5,000 square foot lot.

Once this plan was leaked citizens expressed their discontent and The Seattle Times, well known for being NIMBY, criticized the plan

>Inside City Hall, these kind of questions are dismissed as NIMBY protectionism — or, as the Planning and Development Department Director Diane Sugimura said this week, it’s simply “opposition to change.” Actually, neighborhoods often merely want design standards to protect against ugly or poorly constructed town homes popping up like pimples. - [Seattle Times Editorial Board: July 16, 2015](https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/city-needs-to-slow-down-and-make-the-case-on-housing-affordability-plan/)

The plan was also criticized for being ""crafted in secret"" by advisatory committees. This criticism also helped kill [changes proposed by Mayor Mike McGinn](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/developer-interests-guide-mcginn-in-proposals-to-ease-some-rules/) in 2012. In the end [Mayor Murray and the council greatly reduced the initial ambitious goals of HALA](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/mayor-murray-withdraws-proposal-to-allow-more-density-in-single-family-zones/). 

This demand from citizens to be intimately involved in every change in Seattle is called [the Seattle process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_process). I suspect this is partly why Mosqueda publicly proposed the neighborhood residential plan along with community meetings, so the council does not get accused of trying to make sweeping changes in secret. Even with the cautiousness Mosqueda put into the plan, The Seattle Times is still not happy.

>She’s now proposing to undercut single-family zoning by swapping out the category title for “neighborhood residential.” That change may look mild, but the generic label can cover a practically boundless range of development. - [Seattle Times Editorial Board: July 13, 2021](https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/the-times-makes-no-recommendation-for-seattle-city-council-position-8/)

## 1994: Urban Villages

In 1992, Mayor Norman Rice said this

>[""This may not be a popular view in some circles but I do not believe we should try to stop growth.""](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/24/us/parting-from-no-growth-orthodoxy-seattle-mayor-plans-urban-villages.html)

In order to comply with the newly enacted Growth Management Act and to plan for future growth in the city Mayor Rice's administration first proposed the ""urban village"" strategy in which increased density, of all forms, would be permitted in specific areas in Seattle. Taller apartments and businesses, frequent transit, and walkable neighborhoods. Because this was a major change that invited new people into Seattle and had requirements for affordable housing, some people fought against the proposal.

>The plan has many good points but contains ""neighborhood-killing viruses,"" said Charlie Chong, an organizer of the Neighborhood Rights Campaign. In another reference to assisted housing, he said planners should consider ""whether or not we are moving our city toward the urban villages the (comprehensive plan) describes or are moving toward the creation of urban slums.""
>
>""In my opinion, the comprehensive plan is the worst thing that's happened to West Seattle since mandatory busing,"" Chong said. - [The Seattle Times: March 8, 1994](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19940308&slug=1899168)

Mayor Rice made concessions in order to get the plan passed. [Language calling for a decrease in automobile traffic was removed from the plan, and the affordable housing mandate was reduced by two-thirds. In the end, Rice and his allies managed to get the plan through the city council on a rather stridently debated 6-3 vote.](https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-seattle-comprehensive-plan.html) Now, the urban village strategy is approaching 30 years old and is showing its age. The Seattle Times quoted him recently

>Nearly 30 years later, with Seattle’s population approaching 800,000 and the median home price recently topping $900,000,”it’s time to probably refresh,” Rice said in a recent interview. He isn’t sure quite how, but “If I had to deal with this today … I almost certainly would be looking at different options,” he said. - [The Seattle Times: July 27, 2021](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattles-longstanding-urban-village-strategy-for-growth-needs-reworking-new-report-says/)

## 2024: Looking Forward

In 2018 the [*Neighborhoods for All* report](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SeattlePlanningCommission/SPCNeighborhoodsForAllFINALdigital2.pdf#page=33) published by the [Seattle Planning Commission](http://www.seattle.gov/planningcommission/) said this in support of renaming ""single family zone"" to ""Neighborhood Residential""

>Create several categories of “Neighborhood Residential” zoning that allow different mixes of housing types based on the existing form and scale of a neighborhood, including the predominant lot sizes, building typologies, and other contextual features. For example, one designation may allow row houses and small apartments, while areas that have predominantly larger lot sizes may allow cottage and courtyard housing.

In the 2019/2020 Comprehensive Plan amendment cycle Seattle City Council proposed an amendment to do just this. OPCD then stated that the amendment should be addressed in the next major update to the comprehensive plan and declined to review it. The Planning Commission said this in their [2019/2020 recommendation comments letter, May 15, 2020](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SeattlePlanningCommission/ComprehensivePlan/SPC2019CompPlancycleamendmentsrec.pdf)

>The City Council has proposed an amendment that would recommend an alternative name for single family zones, such as Neighborhood Residential, and amend the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan to implement this change. OPCD has stated this amendment could be more appropriately addressed through the next Major Update to the Comprehensive Plan, with the rationale that it is a bigger change outside of the scope of the annual amendments. The Planning Commission has concerns about waiting until the 2024 Major Update to the Comprehensive Plan to address an alternative name for single family zoning. The name ‘single family’ zoning has been a misnomer since 1994 when the city passed Accessory Dwelling Unit legislation allowing two households to live on a single family zoned parcel and is not representative of the households that currently live in those zones. This name is also linked to Seattle’s former use of race-based zoning as an exclusionary practice. The Commission applauds and supports the City Council in the proposed amendment that would recommend changing the name of the zoning earlier than the Major Update. This change could also serve to inform the policy process considering alternatives to single family zoning.
>
>The Planning Commission has been a consistent advocate for reexamining Seattle’s land use policies to expand the range and affordability of housing choices. Our 2018 Neighborhoods for All report emphasized the benefits of allowing more housing and increasing housing choices in single family zones. The Commission applauds the City Council for including funding in the 2020 budget to analyze a variety of housing types in single family zones in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Major Update to the Comprehensive Plan. We look forward to providing our input on this subject throughout the process to update the Comprehensive Plan. In the meantime, the Commission recommends moving the effort to rename single family zoning forward sooner than the beginning of the Major Update.

Now with the council moving attempting forward with this proposal before the 2024 Major Update the Planning Commission said this in their [2020/2021 recommendation comments letter](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SeattlePlanningCommission/ComprehensivePlan/SPC_2020-21_Comp_Plan_Cycle_amendment_recommendations.pdf)

>We fully support the City Council proposed amendment to replace the term “Single-Family Area” 
with “Neighborhood Residential Area” in the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map, relevant 
elements in the plan, neighborhood plans and appendices. ... This change could also serve to inform the policy process 
considering alternatives to Single-Family zoning.

They also specifically underlined this sentence

>*The Commission applauds the City Council for forwarding this amendment and strongly supports its adoption.*

Clearly the Planning Commission thinks that name change is an immediate priority but the OPCD is cautious about implementing it before the next Major Update. Land use, and as a extension housing, is a fairly fundamental part of the comprehensive plan. The [latest comprehensive plan](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPCD/OngoingInitiatives/SeattlesComprehensivePlan/CouncilAdopted2020.pdf) is 601 pages that contains the following sections under citywide planning (you may notice they generally repeat the goals outlined in the GMA)

- Growth Strategy
- Land Use
- Transportation
- Housing
- Capital Facilities
- Utilities
- Economic Development
- Environment
- Parks and Open Space
- Arts and Culture
- Community Well-Being
- Community Engagement
- Container Port
- Shoreline Areas

and contains neighborhood plans for 33 neighborhoods. Major updates to the Comprehensive Plan typically take two years, involves many city departments, and requires input from the citizens of the city. A change in name only to single family zoning appears to be small, [the draft legislation is currently only 36 pages](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Council/Committees/LandUseNeighborhoods/LEG-Neighborhood-Residential-Comprehensive-Plan-ORD.pdf) but attempting to fully legalize multi-family housing citywide is a change that most likely requires the full support and coordination of multiple city departments, the mayor's office, Seattle City Council, King County, and the Puget Sound Regional Council.

I've quoted some criticisms of proposed updates to Seattle's comprehensive plan above, that increased density is bad for the city, that increased density could bring ""urban slums"" or that neighborhoods just want to ""protect against ugly or poorly constructed town homes popping up like pimples"". Another set of criticisms would come from the libertarian, Reason crowd. That there is too much process involved or that there is ""seemingly zero sense of urgency; misguided faith in procedure, which ultimately lets the great be the enemy of the good"". [There definitely are a ton of reports and recommendations published on the Comprehensive Plan site](http://www.seattle.gov/opcd/ongoing-initiatives/comprehensive-plan#projectdocuments). I, however, do not know what a process free comprehensive plan would look like.

Let me repeat the question I aimed to answer, can Seattle City Council legalize multi-family housing citywide right now? This year, no, because the 2021 Comprehensive Plan amendments cycle has already started, it is too late to submit proposals, and according to state law its illegal to make additional changes. Next year, probably not unless the council wants to receive little to no support from city departments, get torn apart by The Seattle Times, and probably get sued once something is passed because, without any community engagement or a thorough review, something illegal will be passed and someone will be upset. Anyway by next year the formal 2024 Major Update process will have begun.

"Friends, Romans, Floridamen:

As you may have noticed, over the last couple of days our subs have been down in protest of Reddit's tolerance for dangerous misinformation on this platform. Our stated goals were the removal of large subreddits that promoted self-harm under the guise of ""medical advice"" and a commitment to better handling of misinformation on the platform going forward.

Today, with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/), Reddit has agreed to most of our requests. We did it, everyone. Not we the moderators, but we the users of Reddit -- all of us, from powermods to 0-karma lurkers. Together, we creators made it clear that Reddit works for us and with us, and not the other way around. Thank you to each and every one of you for bearing with us on this, and especially thank you to everyone who sent us a note of encouragement and support. You should all be very proud of what we've accomplished.

With that said, we also need to be very clear about this: misinformation about COVID, in any way shape or form, will not be tolerated on this subreddit. COVID misinformation isn't a matter of opinion. This is not an issue with two sides. We have always encouraged and been open to discourse about policies like shutdowns, business closures, and verification requirements, because those are public policies that have multiple valid options and perspectives. However, there can be no discourse or discussion about things like the safety and efficacy of vaccines, the need for mask use, and the off-label use of dangerous drugs to ""treat"" a condition that they have been proven to do nothing for. There is no possibility of dialogue on these issues because these issues only have two sides: the right one, supported by research and the entire global healthcare community, and the wrong one, made up of dangerous and misleading lies, half-truths, and contortions. 
  
Facts are not subject to opinion. They are open to discussion and examination, but not by the general public in the public arena, because the vast majority of us lack the qualifications to hold an informed opinion on the matter. A lifetime watching YouTube videos, visiting Wikipedia, and reading articles you find through leading Google searches does not begin to cover even a year of intense study that real medical and public health professionals undergo as part of their training. A high school biology class and a Facebook group are not a substitute for a PhD and years of post-doctoral work. Opinions are not a valid answer to facts.
  
**Fact:** The COVID vaccines commonly available are safe, effective, and offer tremendous protection from both contracting COVID and from the worst effects of the virus.
  
**Fact:** Masks help significantly in curtailing the spread of the virus, and should be worn by everyone in public spaces, regardless of symptoms. Even cloth masks help reduce viral transmission significantly, though a properly fitted and worn N95 mask is the most effective.
  
**Fact:** Barring a very few, very rare exceptions, masks are safe to wear. Masks do not create any health hazards, cut off breathing, or increase CO2 levels. Masks are safe. People with COPD are able to wear facemasks all day without suffering any ill effects. Athletes are able to wear masks while strenuously exerting themselves. Children are able to wear masks all day at school without suffering any ill effects. 
  
**Fact:** Ivermectin does not show any promise at reducing COVID symptoms or curing infections. It is a dangerous drug, with several severe side effects, and has already been responsible for multiple injuries and hospitalizations, along with dramatically increasing calls to poison control across the country for side-effects ranging from the humorous (uncontrollable defecation) to the serious (liver damage). Ivermectin should not be used to attempt to treat or prevent COVID-19.
  
**Fact:** This virus has already killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States. It is far more dangerous than any flu outbreak in recent history, both in terms of infectivity and in terms of mortality. While it's true that older people are more vulnerable, younger and healthier people are increasingly becoming seriously ill from the Delta variant. Co-morbidities are certainly an issue, but co-morbidities do not mean ""only overweight, out of shape people die from COVID"" - many of the co-morbidities that cause serious infections are genetic and unalterable by diet, exercise, a gluten-free lifestyle, or healing crystals. Over two thirds of Americans have comorbidities that can contribute to COVID severity, and most live full, healthy lives. 
  
**Fact:** A lower mortality rate in your age group doesn't mean getting COVID is a breeze. It is a terrible virus that can cause severe problems during and after being ill. The illness itself can range from mild to ""medically-induced coma with a tube down your throat."" If you've never been intubated, I promise that it is an awful feeling. Even after recovery, a full third of patients report ""long COVID"" symptoms that persist for over 6 months after recovery ranging from shortness of breath and weakness to an inability to smell or taste food. Increasingly, doctors and researchers are finding out that COVID infections in unvaccinated people can cause permanent long-term damage to the vascular, respiratory, and nervous systems. Surviving COVID is just the first step on a long road to recovery that can potentially last your lifetime.
 
COVID is not a joke. It is not a matter of opinion or an ""opportunity for open discussion."" Real people are suffering and dying. People we know. People you know. People your friends and family know and love. There is a real human cost to misinformation, and we will not tolerate it in any shape or form.

Any of the following will result in an instant ban with no warning, no appeal, and no second chances:

1. Denying that COVID is real, downplaying the risks of COVID in any way, or discouraging people from taking effective precautions to avoid this often-debilitating illness. This includes telling people to ""just stay home if you're scared.""
2. Misleading or casting doubt on the efficacy of masks, discouraging mask use, or otherwise encouraging people to not mask up. Masks work. Period. End of discussion.
3. Misleading, casting doubt, or otherwise discouraging people from vaccinating themselves against COVID.
4. Bragging about taking actions that endanger yourself and the people around you for internet clout in regard to COVID. Don't wear a mask? Don't plan to get vaccinated? Don't quarantine after positive diagnosis?  Keep it to yourself. It's not something to brag about.
5. Promoting any medical treatments that are out of line with the recommendations of the CDC, FDA, and WHO. If you're not a sheep, you shouldn't be taking sheep dewormer.
6. Racially-motivated bullshit about the origins of COVID, the Delta variant, or the current spike in cases. It's not a Chinese bioweapon, it's not being brought in by immigrants, and neither outright racism nor coded dog-whistles will be tolerated.
7. Lying about COVID numbers, misleading with data, or otherwise using official reports in bad faith. We get it -- you failed High School Algebra. But don't come in here and try to pass off a stats fail as the end of the pandemic.
8. Anything that falls under the general spirit of these rules but doesn't explicitly violate their letter. Trying to be clever isn't the same thing as actually being clever, and we're not going to change our minds because you think you have the rhetorical skills of Hamilton.

What is allowed? Discussion about policy carried out in a civil and good faith manner. Talk about how the virus is impacting your life and community. Praise or blame for the politician of your choice who agrees/disagrees with the direction you think we should be going in. Discussions about how policies are implemented, etc.

Thank you again, to all of you, and happy Florida-ing!"|Florida|2021|True|0

"EDIT: just in case anyone's wondering, there's no need to live in the Inner West to come along or join the group, that's just where we're centred around, anyone's welcome so long as you're down to trek it from wherever you're at!

Hey all,
The recently founded but highly promising (no bias I swear) Inner West Hang Out group is having yet another gathering this weekend after having a great time a couple weeks ago.
Just a chill casual picnic in Camperdown Memorial Park this time around, open to all. Bring some snax, drinx, a blanket, any card or board games that you're comfy bringing out, whatever you reckon'll be fun. Maybe eventually wind up at a pub, stroll King St, head somewhere more spacious for a bit of frisbeeing: just see where the arvo takes us. If you're apprehensive about checking this kind of thing out then hey, why not just head out for a sick hang in Newtown and if you're feelin it pop over for a bit and check out the vibe?
As per any and all of our gatherings, all are welcome, no age/gender/race/job or study status/sexuality/religion/shoe size/etc. expectations, social anxiety/awkwardness more than fine (let's face it, this is Reddit, we're prob all a bit that way). If you're nice and keen to hang and have some fun then come along!
And if you're not free Saturday/reading this from the future but would be down for something like this, or just any sort of hang out in/around the area join the Inner West Hang Out Facebook group here!
Cheers all, hope to see you there."|sydney|2017|True|0

Yeah nothing much more to it, would just be fun to get a good bunch of friendly peeps together for a chill casual hang: have some fun, get out and enjoy the fkn awesome weather of late, get a bit active, eat some snacks, all that good stuff.

Definitely with a bit of an emphasis on getting outdoors and at least a little active, just coz god knows we all could do with a bit more of that stuff + also it's fun. No expectations of skillfulness/activity level whatsoever, definitely no srs competitive shit, nothing too intense, just fuckin around making fools of ourselves for the fun of it. On that note if you've got a soccer ball/frisbee/any other fun stuff to bring along please do!

All welcome, no age/gender/race/job or study status/sexuality/religion/shoe size/etc. expectations, social anxiety/awkwardness more than fine (let's face it, this is Reddit, we're prob all a bit that way). If you're nice and keen to hang and have some fun then come along.

Thinking meet 11ish at ~~a convenient Inner West park - Enmore Park, Petersham Park, Marrickville Park, Steel Park, etc, whatever suits best (if you're interested in coming please comment which you'd prefer!) and take it from there. Like I said real casual so BYO food/drinks n stuff, share or don't, whatever~~ **let's just keep it simple and say Enmore Park**

And if you're not free tomorrow/reading this ***in the future*** but would be down for something like this  then please join the [Inner West Hang Out Facebook group here!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1945317509040087/?ref=br_rs) Early days but we're really hoping to make this a thing so the more the merrier.

The only reason I can assume you do this is because you think you are sick cunts and want to 'fuck the system' You aren't sick cunts and you are definitely not fucking the system. No one is impressed/wants to fuck you, we all think you are overcompensating for an obvious un-grown member ,which you are.

"My father in law fractured a bone, and received surgery at HonorHealth. He has advanced cancer. He had Covid a few weeks ago, but somehow still tested positive despite having no symptoms. 

Now, the hospital will not allow any guests, and his spouse cannot visit for more than 1 hr a day. How is this at all reasonable? Due to his cancer, he has very poor cognitive reasoning skills (probably partially due to cancer but also due to morphine and other pain medication).

Is there a workaround? It seems like he needs an advocate to speak up for him."|phoenix|2021|True|1
I hate it here, druggies get off scot free. No rehab unless they wanna go. People can OD, go to the hospital, be saved from dying and get sent home like nothing happened. What the actual fuck is wrong with this state? Back home in Massachusetts, if you're caught with drugs or overdose you get sent to rehab, why can't this state be the same? I'm so glad to be drug free myself but goddamn druggies have it so easy here. I'm sick of this shit, what can I do to help change things so that druggies are sent to rehab without consent? |SouthCarolina|2024|True|0
"I currently live in Florida and am looking to move back to South Carolina. It’s just getting too crowded here, we want to move somewhere a little further away from people, but not completely out in the woods. Plus I’m sick of it being summer 10 months out of the year. South Carolina wasn’t drastically different, but there were a few more months of relief. 

I always thought Florida was lucky to not have any state income tax, but I know we get hit in other areas. For example property taxes and car insurance are substantially higher in Florida than in South Carolina. It makes me wonder if it offsets the benefit of not having state income tax. Not sure how the other costs of living compare.

Obviously I know it will largely vary based on the counties, but how does the overall cost of living (with all things considered) compare between Florida and South Carolina?"|SouthCarolina|2024|True|0
I have my dream job but I’m only paid about $15 because it’s a non profit. This is a job I got with a degree and is pretty competitive. But I live in Beaufort County with my parents and I need to move out. I am sick of being here in disgusting conditions really. I’m not abused or anything but I just can’t take it anymore but I don’t even know where to go to find rent that I could actually afford while also factoring in savings, groceries, gas, car payment, and utilities. Even just looking for places with rooms to rent with roommates I don’t even know is often times still to expensive. And I could deal with living with other people but I’d rather not. I’d much rather have a studio. I’m so drained socially from work and living in such a disgusting house my whole life has turned me into a germaphobe as my parents like to call me and obsessive over a clean kitchen so having a roommate just a little messy will drive me up the wall. I also don’t want to live with strangers but all my friends (who are messy anyways) moved away. |SouthCarolina|2024|True|0

"Vermonters ages 18-29:  it’s finally your turn! Here's the info you need to find a shot starting Monday, April 19th and/or move up your appointment slot:

# How do I sign up?

**There are 4 main places to look for vaccines:**

* [VT Department of Health](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration)
   * **This is the main clearinghouse for Vermont appointments and the best place to start, with clinic locations in every county.** Some counties have more appointment slots per capita than others (Rutland County, for example, has a high capacity clinic in Rutland and typically does not fill up as quickly as Addison/Grand Isle/Franklin/Washington. Chittenden has many high capacity clinics and also many people, so earlier appointments will fill quickly but there are often slots available for a couple weeks out).
   * **Online registration is expected to open at 6AM on Monday.** Previous groups were told it would open at 8:15am and it opened anywhere from 15-30 minutes early, so be aware that it may not open at 6 on the dot. *ETA*: it opened at 5:50AM.
   * **It is a good idea to pre-register online** so you've already entered the info that takes the most time to fill out. Be aware that there will be another set of questions to answer after the system opens but before you can get through to the scheduler.
   * The call line  (855-722-7878) opens at 8:15AM and is a good option if you have trouble with the online system.
* [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine)
   * CVS and Walgreens both receive weekly or semi-weekly vaccine allocations that are separate from the state through the federal pharmacy program. **CVS and Walgreens's online systems only book out for 4-5 days ahead of time, and release appointments at somewhat random times, usually in the early morning.**
   * CVS locations in VT: Barre, Bennington, Burlington, Colchester, Essex, Morrisville, Rutland, South Burlington, and Williston.
   * **You do not need an account to make an appointment.** Once you've clicked an appointment time for the first and second doses, CVS will hold those slots for you for 30 minutes while you fill out the rest of the info. This is a huge relief, as you don't have to rush through the fillable fields.
   * **If you're up late tonight or before 6AM tomorrow, check CVS and Walgreens first just in case.**
      * If no locations in Vermont have appointments available on the front page, you can click through another state that does have available appts to reach the scheduler. This saves you a little time if you want to hang out on the zip code search page.
      * Often in the early morning you'll hit a waiting room as you try to get through to the scheduler (either ""we are adding new appointments, check back later"" or a message about high traffic).  If you reach a waiting screen, just keep refreshing and eventually it will take you through to the scheduling system - but it might take >30 minutes.
      * Zip codes can be searched by the first 3 numbers (e.g., ""054"" for Chittenden County) to cast a slightly wider net.
* [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/schedulevaccine)
   * Like CVS, Walgreens only schedules appointments 4-5 days out. In the past, it's mostly released new appointment slots at 7AM, but in the last week releases have been at random times through the day. It releases a wave of appointments every few days.
   * **Unlike CVS, you need an account to make an appointment.** It helps to make one ahead of time, so your information will already be filled out if new slots are released.
   * Also unlike CVS, Walgreens does not hold your appointment slot once you've clicked a time. Move fast when you're entering info.
   * The Walgreens site is glitchy. Sometimes you'll hit an error screen if you aren't logged in to your account, or if you're in a browser that Walgreens doesn't like. Try logging in first, then try a different browser if you're still running into issues.
* [Kinney Drugs](https://kinneydrugs.com/pharmacy/covid-19/vaccination-scheduling/vt/)
   * Kinney has the easiest scheduling system to navigate among the pharmacies, but relatively fewer appointments. It apparently updates on a weekly basis, but appointments have remained nearly full except at a couple locations for the last two weeks. Kinney schedules many weeks out, and their short-term availability is random. ETA: all Kinney appointments are full as of 7AM Monday.
   * Each location either distributes Moderna or Pfizer; the Pfizer locations are listed separately [here](https://kinneydrugs.com/pharmacy/covid-19/vaccination-scheduling/vt/pfizer-locations/) to make them easier to find for 16-17 year olds.
   * **You can check, but it's mostly going to be luck in finding a cancellation until Kinney adds new appointments.**
   * You do not need an account to make an appointment, but it doesn't hold a time once you've clicked on it - **you'll need to enter your info quickly to secure a spot** that opens up. Auto-fill can come in handy on this site.

***ETA:*** **If you're over 16 and live close to New Hampshire, you can also receive the vaccine in NH. Their registration system is all-in-one and can be found here:** [**https://vini.nh.gov/providers/s/**](https://vini.nh.gov/providers/s/). It looks like there may be some openings available this week in the Lebanon/Hanover area.

# Once I've secured a spot, are there ways I can move up to an earlier appointment?

**Yes! If you've booked a slot for several weeks out, do not lose hope! It's absolutely worth checking all four of these sites to see if something has opened up earlier.**

* tl;dr: F5 (refresh button) is your friend! Check back regularly at all four sites and you’ll almost certainly move up your appointment.
* The state regularly adds new clinics, and people who find pharmacy appointments will (and SHOULD) cancel any existing state appointment, opening up those earlier slots at random times. Once you've booked an appointment through the state, you can click  the ""Reschedule"" button (don't worry, hitting that button will not cancel your appointment!) and keep refreshing the county you're interested in to see if any earlier times have popped up. Check nearby counties too, if you have the ability to get there!
* CVS and Walgreens are your best bet for moving up to an appointment that's only a couple days out. Check in the early mornings (midnight to 6AM for CVS, 7AM for Walgreens).
* A handy site to check throughout the day is [Vaccine Spotter](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/VT/), which scrapes and maps out available appointments from the pharmacy sites. It can often be a few minutes behind, but it saves you the trouble of going through the individual sites and zip code searches. There are also a few Twitter accounts that share releases/updates using the #OurShotVT hashtag.
* *ETA*: There's a new tool that uses the Vaccine Spotter API to send email notifications when new appointments pop up in your area. There's a few minute delay, but it could come in handy if you'd rather not sit there refreshing! Sign up here: [https://covid-vaccine-notifications.org/](https://covid-vaccine-notifications.org/)

**IMPORTANT: If you manage to book an earlier appointment, please remember to cancel any existing appointment** to open it up to others in the queue!!

# Other FAQs:

* *Do I need insurance? Does the vaccine cost anything?*
   * No, it's free through all of the systems! If you have insurance, you'll be asked to enter that info as it will help cover the cost to the state or pharmacy.
* *Can I choose which vaccine I get?*
   * The vaccine that's being distributed at a particular site will be listed up front in whichever system you use, so you'll know  which you're getting. Right now, they're still only scheduling Moderna or Pfizer at all locations (state and retail pharmacy). J&J is expected to resume scheduling around Friday of this week.
* *Do I need to bring anything with me?*
   * I was not asked for my driver's license or insurance card at a state site, but you may be asked for both at a retail pharmacy location. Technically, you don't need either.
* *What are the side effects? When should I expect them to kick in?*
   * The side effects are your immune system at work! The most common symptoms of the first dose of either Moderna or Pfizer are a sore arm, starting anywhere from 0-12 hours after the shot, and fatigue from 12-24 hours.
   * Symptoms are usually stronger after the second dose, when your immune system has already been primed to respond; they are also typically stronger after the first dose if you've already had COVID than if you've never had it. You'll most likely have a sore arm again, which may be accompanied by fatigue/muscle aches/headache/sore lymph nodes/chills/short fever. Aka, general crumminess that hits its peak about a day after the vaccine.
   * Treat the day after vaccine like you would a cold or a hangover: rest and fluids with electrolytes are your friend.
* *When am I protected from the virus?*
   * **It takes time for the antibodies to build up in your body. You're not protected immediately!**
   * For the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, you do not have much protection for the first 7-10 days and should continue to follow all of the same precautions as pre-vaccine. Antibodies ramp up quickly after 10-12 days, and efficacy against symptomatic infection is estimated at around 60% once you're two weeks past the first dose, up to over 80% at four weeks past the first dose. Efficacy against any infection isn’t far behind (a little under 50% at two weeks past the first dose, [according to data on Pfizer from Israel](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765?query=featured_home)).
   * Efficacy reaches 90-95%+ around two weeks after the second dose. This doesn't mean you couldn't have a breakthrough infection - and you should definitely still get tested if you come down with COVID symptoms - but it's a lot more unlikely at this point!
* *Do I need to keep wearing a mask? What can I do when I've waited it out and am fully vaccinated?*
   * It depends on the context! Until vaccination starts to send community case rates to a much lower threshold, you'll still need to wear a mask and distance in public spaces and gatherings of people that aren't fully vaccinated (the list of unvaccinated people includes children, who probably won't be able to get the vaccine for months).
   * But new doors will open: you can gather indoors with other fully vaxed people. And hug them. And feel the relief of being much more protected from infection yourself. The current CDC recommendations on what you can do post-vax are [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html).
   * Lots of fun stuff with friends is on the horizon (bars? indoor dining? DJ Taka Fridays? maybe even VT Brew Fest?) #Shotgirlsummer is coming y'all.

"Hi fellow subredditors,

I've been having an issue with the MSPCA not responding or providing results to services rendered. I was wondering if I could gain some insight on getting them to respond.

I took a sick rabbit into the MPSCA at the beginning of September for GI Stasis. She's been having more frequent cases of this, and GI stasis are a common cause of deaths for rabbits. This has been the third time she's been sick since May. The MSPCA was able to help her recover, although one of the times they neglected to put food in front of her (Helps promote GI movement again) for FOUR hours. I was so angry. They tried saying she must have had food and wasn't interested, I asked if there was hay in front of her, and they said no. I responded, well I don't think she had food in front of her then... and they agreed with me. That should be have been a huge red flag to me that they were trying to cover up for their mistake. Rabbits are nervous creatures and are unlikely to take food from a stranger, so a lot of times a rabbit savvy person would know you just leave the hay with them to be eaten.

A month after that hospitalization, she had GI stasis AGAIN (insert internal screaming and hair pulling). I take her to the MPSCA since that's where we've always gotten care and her records are there. The vets and staff were responsive during her admission, and she got a CT scan to see if there might be anything causing the GI Stasis, like a tumor or something else. The bill came out to be $3000 for this hospitalization. The CT scan was $676 and a test for e cuniculi is 250$. I was told the results should be back 3-4 days for CT and and up to a week for e cuniculi results to be back. It's been WELL over a week since the results should have came back for both of those tests. I have been calling, and all they've said it is due to the COVID emergency that CT readings are delayed. Which makes NO sense to me, since I work in the hospital, and a radiologist doesn't have to be in house to read a CT scan. I've called again and asked them to clarify the process of getting the CT read, for example, is it being outsourced? But all I've been is ignored by the Avian and Exotics Service. We've gotten NO response from the veterinarian since we've paid the bill as well.

Not to mention my rabbit has been getting sick more frequently and I'm worried that she will get sick AGAIN and the scan could show something that was preventable. Any ideas on how to get them to respond in a more meaningful way vs ""oh covid pandemic etc""?

&#x200B;

tldr: spent $3000 on emergency care for my rabbit, now being ignored after payment and cannot get test results. I'm afraid something that could have been prevented will sicken my rabbit again.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I want the MSPCA to improve their practice. In hospital they use Press ganey scores and post hospitalization patient feedback. Restaurants use yelp. But there doesn't seem to be any centralized customer service dept at the MSPCA to give feedback to. I'm a huge animal lover and have donated to the MSPCA before, this feels like a swift kick to the crotch. lol. "|Boston|2020|True|0
"My roommate has been thinking about renting a parking space nearby, because she's racked up three tickets in two weeks, and is sick of fighting for a street spot outside of our apartment.

"My two kids came down with coughs and runny noses so we all went to get tested at the free site on Aurora and 120th St. I signed my two kids up for appointments on the website the night before, but my husband and I were able to get tested as walk ins at the same time. The whole process was really fast and we waited less than ten minutes. They were great with the kids (they don’t stick the swab in very far with the younger ones) and it was just weirdly uncomfortable for the adults. It wasn’t painful. Just the feeling of something where it shouldn’t be, similar to water going up your nose, but more intense. 

Results are expected back in less than 36 hours. 

Overall, A plus job by everyone working at the site! They even had lollipops for the kids, which really helped my 1 year old who was freaked out by the stranger touching her face. My 3 year old barely reacted to the entire experience."|seattle|2020|True|1

"TL;DR I, the hardest working person in a healthcare setting, got written up for failing to treat pts and team members with compassion and respect after refusing to walk a pt that the nurse should've walked to begin with

I (48F) work for a large Healthcare cooperation, in  one of their many hospitals, as a certified nursing assistant/ patient care technician. I've been in healthcare for 14 years, 6 of them in hospitals, all over the country. I started at this hospital Sept. of last year, after having just moved to the area from Texas. 

Today my manager (~35F, we'll call her B1) wrote me up for not abiding by the commitments of this corporation in the way I had spoken to a patient and a nurse, namely ""with compassion and understanding"". She also told me that if I told anyone about what was said when she called me into her office that I would be fired. 

Now for some more background. I had just switched to night shift from days, like 2 days prior. I went from getting 8-9 hours of sleep to maybe getting 5. I was a walking zombie. 
I work 5-6 twelve hour shifts a week, 130 hours every 2 weeks. 

To top it off, I have a stress factor in my lower spine and arthritis in my hips from being hit by a car when i was a teenager. Pain makes me even more tired. 

The night in question I was the only pct on the floor with 16 pts. When this happens, each nurse is supposed to assume total care of one of their patients, from vitals to bathroom trips to blood draws. Total care. 

The morning of the incident there was a meeting between the manager and all the techs on the floor to ""go over expectations"" that was expected of us for the new year. I had specifically asked B if there was only one tech on the floor during night shift, were they responsible for passing morning waters to the pts, to which she replied ""absolutely"".

At the end of my night shift that day, at 6am, I went and started preparing the waters. The nurse(~40F, we'll call B2),  called me over the comm asking where I was. I told her so she came and told me she needed me to walk a pt. He was what we call a standby, a walkie, talkie, just needs help with his pole, an easy pt. 

I must've given her a look when I pointed out the obvious, I'm in the middle of preparing to pass water to 16 pts. She said ""you're the only tech on the floor, you don't need to do that"". Mind you, this is the first time I've worked with this person, just met her at the start of the shift. 

I explained the meeting that morning, that I absolutely was responsible and I wasn't going to ignore what I considered a direct order from my manager because of what this random person was telling me. I guess I wasn't exactly polite when I said this, idk, remember, I'm a zombie in pain at this moment. 

She's like whatever, I'll walk the pt. Good, I'm passing waters. I don't remember this next part happening, but the nurse told the manager I was rude to the pt when I gave him his water. I really can't imagine this though, I'm usually NEVER rude to pts unless it's in response to them being rude to me. 

Fast forward a week, when my year turned horrific. In the span of 1 week, while still adjusting to working night shift, the alternator went in my car ($1400 to fix, missed a day of work), I got covid (missed 2 days of work due to having a fever), and my phone broke ($100, wasn't going to get another for 3-5 business days).

Now I'm adjusting to night shift, while walking to work, sick, with no phone, in 30° weather, at night.  Life sucked. I send my manager an email my first day back to work, explaining what was going on and that I don't have a phone. This goes on for a couple of days. 

I finally started to feel better, I was getting closer to getting my car and phone back and I was getting more sleep. I started to feel like my run of bad luck had ended. Then, at 7am, I was getting ready to leave when my manager was like, come in my office, I texted you that we were having a meeting this morning. 

I walk into her office, saying hey, I sent you an email, I don't have a phone, I didn't get your text. The other woman is a manager for a different unit, who B1 introduces as ""her mentor"" who will be serving as a witness. She pulls up a list and starts going over lies, half truths and misunderstandings, treating them all like gospel.
 
I was so tired and in so much pain and completely gobsmacked by this meeting.
 I do more on this floor then all the other techs combined. I'm never late, rarely call out and am constantly going above and beyond. I've gotten written praise from pts and never any complaints. I do everything she asks of us and so much more. In the 5 months I've worked there, B1 has tapped me as preceptor on 4 different occasions, with 4 new hires.

I was upset, to say the least. I listened and argued for 30 min before finally asking if she was done because I was tired and wanted to go home. I left and worried about this meeting for the next 4 days. 

Today she called me in again, to finish the meeting. The other manager was there. B1 said that they were writing me up for ""failure to treat pts and team members with dignity, respect, and compassion and that I failed to listen and respond to team members"". And, that if I told anyone what was said in this meeting, I would be fired.

- I paid my bill in November. Then enrolled in autopay. Due to the timing of when I paid my bill, they charged me twice that month. I had to place a fraudulent claim with my bank, which then resulted in both payments being refunded. PGW subsequently billed me again in December for the previous payment, new charges, and added ""cancelled check fees"". I disputed this, got nowhere, and paid to end the hassle. 

Fast forward to February. I cancelled my enrollment from autopay, paid my full bill early, yet their system still tried to bill in the middle of the month because it hadn't recognized my autopay cancellation. My bank flagged this duplicate charge as fraudulent, which resulted in the payment being labeled a ""bad check"" charge by PGW, and I now have an additional charge on my new bill and have been reverted to ""cash only"" for a year.

Keep in mind I have paid all of my bills in addition to their bullshit extra charges. It doesn't matter that I've actually paid. What matters is that their system is too stupid to understand when an account is paid in full and is coded to pull a set amount regardless. I'm now having to dispute the ""bad check"" charge, pay my bill at a Walgreens, and have been labeled as a problematic account. All while always paying on time. 

This same thing happened two years ago when they transitioned to their new system, did not inform their customers the new system required renenrollment in autopay, and subsequently allowed my account to rack up 800 dollars in late fees. 

It's fucking sick and I'm kicking myself for now moving into the gas free apartment that I had the opportunity to live in some time ago.

"Look, I'm beyond sick and tired of the endlessly escalating political rhetoric both here in Wisconsin and nationally.  And while I'm of the opinion that most of it comes from the GOP, they also don't have a monopoly on partisan tribalism.

But what is especially grating to me is that opinion pieces and articles like this one keep getting greenlit and spread like wildfire but without fail never EVER address why anyone, of any ideological leaning might have reason to be afraid of another Trump term.  Completely ignoring the fact that he's quite literally saying he'll be a dictator, was the driving force to overturn a legitimate election and uses the terminology of Hitler's Mein Kampf.   All while also stating misleading stuff like we're dealing with historic inflation(we're not, it's completely leveled off) or the economy is really struggling(it's totally not, while everyone may not feel wonderful about their economic situation, our economy is booming) with zero pushback.

And those same publications will then report on Biden eating ice cream for dinner or some verbal gaffe as if it's just as bad as parroting nazis.   I'm OK with reporting ""both sides"" but our media has absolutely lost all sane objectivity and it could very well end up screwing us all over...even so called Trump supporters.

"For context I was at the pharmacy and stuck behind some woman who is taking her time and engaging in chit chat with the woman who runs the register who also is going her own pace.

I'm getting so sick of waiting in line behind people when like I only have three things to purchase.  When I put in my PIN number I put that thing in as fast as somebody who's blindfolded assembling and reassembling a firearm.

I'm just saying like as a collective human society species could we just like try to acknowledge people out in public.  I mean we have to acknowledge that we all are going somewhere and we all need to like try to do a little bit better to stay out of people's ways.

I'm just kind of I don't know ranting to myself and like what are we doing as like a collective because it seems like we can't get f****** anything done because nobody wants to put in any f****** effort to make anything f****** better.  You know this whole rant is me just trying to get people to give a SHIT.  Now I realize like a lot of people have some hard times but then a lot of these other people they have kids and then they like see their parents and they just have this thing where they say 
""well what are you going to do""
""Well around here"" 
And when I talk sense it's usually followed up with
""Yup""

OCT - 427kWh

NOV - 686kWh

DEC - 641kWh

JAN - 885kWh!?!?!

After the OCT - NOV jump, we stopped using our heat pump & baseboard in DEC, and even though there were eight fewer days in the cycle (four of those being during the power outage), we somehow managed to use more kWh per day than in NOV. Because of this, we cut back EVEN MORE in JAN, and we're now somehow using over 200kWh MORE than the month before!? There's no fucking way that's possible! It looks like to make up for the .05c price drop, they're tacking on fake kWh.

"Context:

I made a popular comment you can find under a Maine Apartment Listings post on FB (verbatim): “For $2k, you can find a place in California where jobs pay up to $10 more per hour and the sun shines 12 months a year. This is getting out of hand.”

This alone triggered Bubar to make a nasty, dissenting (now-deleted) comment complete with the inflammatory “🤣🤣” emojis; bringing negativity into a benign space.

I responded to her with a Zillow screenshot of the $2k 2bd options in Long Beach; “I left in 2022. I know what I’m talking about cunt face. Set your Zillow to 2bed $2k and there are plenty of options. Drop down to 1bd and you can make it work anywhere plus get a raise. Hence why 31 people liked my comment.”

Should I have used the word cunt? No. Was I referencing her nastiness and use of smiley faces and not her real face? Yes.

Cue Bubar calling me white trash. Fine, earned, whatever. But I wasn’t reactive enough to her. I didn’t want to argue with her. So she moved to my DMs. Only after this altercation did I google her, to find that she is a licensed marriage & family therapist on Better Help of all places, and seeking addiction clients. I have reported her to both the Maine and California boards of licensure for her disgusting ableist insults. She also is pro-landlord and appears to live/work in a little box by a water treatment facility, so, clearly triggered. She must have convinced herself that all apartments in California are $3k to cope with the fact she’s been priced out. 
Anyway, 

People who DM strangers to argue are mentally unstable. 
People who use disabilities as insults are sick.

Four-letter-words in an otherwise conversational context should not trigger licensed therapists to escalate arguments and resort to cutting personal attacks. Am I alone in thinking this is insanely egregious?

I tagged her in a TT, so she striked it and went down to the courthouse to get a protection order but it was denied. I have no interest in contacting her. But I think some more locals should know where her head is at.

"Hey Maine people - I'm planning a trip with a large group from all around to (hopefully) see the eclipse on 4/8. I didn't see a ton of other posts specifically asking for suggestions like this on this subreddit, so hopefully this isn't something everyone's sick of seeing by now.

Based on the cloud coverage from the past few years, seems like a 50/50 shot.  Which is fine!

The hope is to have other things to do/see anyway.  But since most of the advice online pertains to the coast of Maine, I was wondering if there might be some cool stuff that isn't already well-reported on between Rangeley and Augusta (a rather large chunk of Maine, I know...)

Idea would be to meet in Portland, then drive either to Augusta where a friend lives OR to Oxford for the casino there (we have a couple people that like to lose money in our group). From there, we'd head into the eclipse path to try our luck again. Bigelow preserve/Rangeley is what I'm looking at on the map - but if Augusta winds up being the choice, farther east would be alright.

Maybe though, our time would be best spent in/near Portland. Then we could just spend a night up in the main vein of Maine to aim for the eclipse just on the day of...

Hello,

I live in a 1BR apartment in a highrise in downtown Louisville, has 18 floors. I was pretty surprised to find that all the windows in every apartment are nailed and sealed shut. I asked management about it initially and they said there's nothing they can do because it's a ""jumping hazard"" and keeping it open would ""violate building code."" Weird but okay.  
A few months later, heating and cooling (we have central heating) breaks down for a while. The house heats up and we now have to all pretty much leave for a few days because we have zero ventilation. I try to ignore this, but as winter approached, I begin to feel super suffocated, get a coughing fit sometimes when I cook, and just....living in the apartment has gotten worse in the cold. Every person in the building has this and I have heard zero complaints so far. I just find this....ridiculous though.

I ask management again about how this is a violation of building code, and it seems more like a violation if you've sealed and nailed ALL the windows shut and there's ZERO fresh air. They asked me to ""buy a humidifier."" I asked my neighbors and they are ALL pissed but haven't complained or asked about this at all so far. I called the city's code enforcement division and they didn't take it too seriously or indicate they were going to look into it. Tenants rights here in the city says every landlord should provide for at least one open window for ventilation.   


Isn't this....illegal or a violation of building code? This is also a fairly big developer here and I don't know what to do. Call my metro councilman? Any advice would be great, thank you. (the Louisville tenants union is closed for the month)"|Louisville|2022|True|0

Health officials say it was identified “in a sample from an adult resident of the Northwest region.” 
They will not identify the person’s city or county, giving only the region. The infected person hasn’t been out of the country, but they did travel around this region.

So what does this mean? Not much right now. Health officials ask people to keep wearing masks indoors when out in public. Also they ask people to wash hands frequently, practice social distancing and get vaccinated.

"I have made the decision to get clean and get off of heroin and meth.

"Friends, Romans, Floridamen:

As you may have noticed, over the last couple of days our subs have been down in protest of Reddit's tolerance for dangerous misinformation on this platform. Our stated goals were the removal of large subreddits that promoted self-harm under the guise of ""medical advice"" and a commitment to better handling of misinformation on the platform going forward.

Today, with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/), Reddit has agreed to most of our requests. We did it, everyone. Not we the moderators, but we the users of Reddit -- all of us, from powermods to 0-karma lurkers. Together, we creators made it clear that Reddit works for us and with us, and not the other way around. Thank you to each and every one of you for bearing with us on this, and especially thank you to everyone who sent us a note of encouragement and support. You should all be very proud of what we've accomplished.

With that said, we also need to be very clear about this: misinformation about COVID, in any way shape or form, will not be tolerated on this subreddit. COVID misinformation isn't a matter of opinion. This is not an issue with two sides. We have always encouraged and been open to discourse about policies like shutdowns, business closures, and verification requirements, because those are public policies that have multiple valid options and perspectives. However, there can be no discourse or discussion about things like the safety and efficacy of vaccines, the need for mask use, and the off-label use of dangerous drugs to ""treat"" a condition that they have been proven to do nothing for. There is no possibility of dialogue on these issues because these issues only have two sides: the right one, supported by research and the entire global healthcare community, and the wrong one, made up of dangerous and misleading lies, half-truths, and contortions. 
  
Facts are not subject to opinion. They are open to discussion and examination, but not by the general public in the public arena, because the vast majority of us lack the qualifications to hold an informed opinion on the matter. A lifetime watching YouTube videos, visiting Wikipedia, and reading articles you find through leading Google searches does not begin to cover even a year of intense study that real medical and public health professionals undergo as part of their training. A high school biology class and a Facebook group are not a substitute for a PhD and years of post-doctoral work. Opinions are not a valid answer to facts.
  
**Fact:** The COVID vaccines commonly available are safe, effective, and offer tremendous protection from both contracting COVID and from the worst effects of the virus.
  
**Fact:** Masks help significantly in curtailing the spread of the virus, and should be worn by everyone in public spaces, regardless of symptoms. Even cloth masks help reduce viral transmission significantly, though a properly fitted and worn N95 mask is the most effective.
  
**Fact:** Barring a very few, very rare exceptions, masks are safe to wear. Masks do not create any health hazards, cut off breathing, or increase CO2 levels. Masks are safe. People with COPD are able to wear facemasks all day without suffering any ill effects. Athletes are able to wear masks while strenuously exerting themselves. Children are able to wear masks all day at school without suffering any ill effects. 
  
**Fact:** Ivermectin does not show any promise at reducing COVID symptoms or curing infections. It is a dangerous drug, with several severe side effects, and has already been responsible for multiple injuries and hospitalizations, along with dramatically increasing calls to poison control across the country for side-effects ranging from the humorous (uncontrollable defecation) to the serious (liver damage). Ivermectin should not be used to attempt to treat or prevent COVID-19.
  
**Fact:** This virus has already killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States. It is far more dangerous than any flu outbreak in recent history, both in terms of infectivity and in terms of mortality. While it's true that older people are more vulnerable, younger and healthier people are increasingly becoming seriously ill from the Delta variant. Co-morbidities are certainly an issue, but co-morbidities do not mean ""only overweight, out of shape people die from COVID"" - many of the co-morbidities that cause serious infections are genetic and unalterable by diet, exercise, a gluten-free lifestyle, or healing crystals. Over two thirds of Americans have comorbidities that can contribute to COVID severity, and most live full, healthy lives. 
  
**Fact:** A lower mortality rate in your age group doesn't mean getting COVID is a breeze. It is a terrible virus that can cause severe problems during and after being ill. The illness itself can range from mild to ""medically-induced coma with a tube down your throat."" If you've never been intubated, I promise that it is an awful feeling. Even after recovery, a full third of patients report ""long COVID"" symptoms that persist for over 6 months after recovery ranging from shortness of breath and weakness to an inability to smell or taste food. Increasingly, doctors and researchers are finding out that COVID infections in unvaccinated people can cause permanent long-term damage to the vascular, respiratory, and nervous systems. Surviving COVID is just the first step on a long road to recovery that can potentially last your lifetime.
 
COVID is not a joke. It is not a matter of opinion or an ""opportunity for open discussion."" Real people are suffering and dying. People we know. People you know. People your friends and family know and love. There is a real human cost to misinformation, and we will not tolerate it in any shape or form.

Any of the following will result in an instant ban with no warning, no appeal, and no second chances:

1. Denying that COVID is real, downplaying the risks of COVID in any way, or discouraging people from taking effective precautions to avoid this often-debilitating illness. This includes telling people to ""just stay home if you're scared.""
2. Misleading or casting doubt on the efficacy of masks, discouraging mask use, or otherwise encouraging people to not mask up. Masks work. Period. End of discussion.
3. Misleading, casting doubt, or otherwise discouraging people from vaccinating themselves against COVID.
4. Bragging about taking actions that endanger yourself and the people around you for internet clout in regard to COVID. Don't wear a mask? Don't plan to get vaccinated? Don't quarantine after positive diagnosis?  Keep it to yourself. It's not something to brag about.
5. Promoting any medical treatments that are out of line with the recommendations of the CDC, FDA, and WHO. If you're not a sheep, you shouldn't be taking sheep dewormer.
6. Racially-motivated bullshit about the origins of COVID, the Delta variant, or the current spike in cases. It's not a Chinese bioweapon, it's not being brought in by immigrants, and neither outright racism nor coded dog-whistles will be tolerated.
7. Lying about COVID numbers, misleading with data, or otherwise using official reports in bad faith. We get it -- you failed High School Algebra. But don't come in here and try to pass off a stats fail as the end of the pandemic.
8. Anything that falls under the general spirit of these rules but doesn't explicitly violate their letter. Trying to be clever isn't the same thing as actually being clever, and we're not going to change our minds because you think you have the rhetorical skills of Hamilton.

What is allowed? Discussion about policy carried out in a civil and good faith manner. Talk about how the virus is impacting your life and community. Praise or blame for the politician of your choice who agrees/disagrees with the direction you think we should be going in. Discussions about how policies are implemented, etc.

"Getting a driver's license renewal soon?  Make sure you are VERY CLEAR which one you want.  Many DMV's are auto-enrolling you for ""real id"" and acting as if that's the only option, causing much headache for those who don't want it / need it in the first place.  For example, if you got married and never changed your name with the social security administration, (and many haven't) you won't pass and will then have to spend a few hours to a full day at the social security administration office to clear this up.  This isn't necessary if all you want is a standard minnesota driver's license .  All you need to renew a regular license is your old license and yourself.  (ie, they only ""verify"" the name with the SSN if you are applying for a Real ID, not a regular ""standard"" driver's license/renewal)

They just did this to my mother at the Sauk Centre DVS - beware, according to the SSA (social security administration) person my mother spoke to in clearing this up many many DMV agents aren't asking what kind of ID/DL you want and just auto-enrolling for the ""Real ID"" for everyone, creating a lot of headache for everybody.  The line at the SSA was out the door - and 1/3 were due to DL issues relating to this topic.  The lady behind her had the same problem - a grandmother who wasn't even told she had a choice in getting a ""regular"" ID versus the Real ID shenanigans.

The DMV is now pushing hard, hard, for everyone to get a ""Real ID,"" to the point of obfuscating your options.  Don't let them make the choice for you, especially if you have a passport or only fly occasionally (!).  (You can still fly with a regular MN ID through late 2020, and after that you can still fly, you'll just have to provide further proof of id to the TSA etc)  If you have a passport already, there really is no reason to get a Real ID, not unless you get your jollies being in another government facial recognition database -

For the Naysayers, here's the part explicitly requiring ssn verificatin for a ""real id""

[https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/real-id/Pages/required-documents.aspx](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/real-id/Pages/required-documents.aspx)

it says:

""Proof of social security number:

If you have not updated your  name change with the Social Security Administration, you must do so  prior to applying for a Real ID.  ""

The Identification requirements for a standard mn driver's license:

[https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/forms-documents/Documents/IdentificationRequirements\_English.pdf](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/forms-documents/Documents/IdentificationRequirements_English.pdf)

So, if you are renewing, and only want a regular ID, make sure the right choice is made - or you may leave without an ID, your account with the dmv ""locked"" and spend a day or two getting your paperwork in order.

"Over the last week I’ve noticed IM SO FUCKING ITCHY!! EVERYWHERE!!

As the title states I’m new to Canberra, moved here from QLD at the end of summer. I’ve heard spring can be hellish for some people, but I’ve never suffered from allergies/hay fever before. As I’m from QLD have never experienced winter before either. 

My skin dried out for the first time (the normal amount I assume) over winter, but everything was fine. I had assumed that if I was gonna get itchy dry skin it would be from winter not spring?? So I’m wondering if this is a Canberra allergy thing, or a me thing??

"Healthcare professionals feel free to elaborate but my December has been hell & hope to save people some time & headache. My college kid brought pink eye & a virus home to us at Thanksgiving (pneumonia is insane on her college campus rn). First got on an antibiotic 12/4. Typical cold turned sinus infection. Once I finished augmentin the sore throat hell began all through Christmas. I had originally tested negative for flu/covid/strep early December. COVID neg again at Christmas. I have never had strep in my life and had convinced myself I had esophageal cancer - it was THAT bad 24/7. The sinus symptoms had gone away but just felt “off” in addition to the throat.

Thursday the wait at KUmed campus urgent care was an hour minimum and was told worse at other locations. They said everyone is sick right now. Left & tried a NextCare location Friday which was even more insane. Left & went back to KUmed main campus & lucked out getting right in.

"An hour ago, my friend called me distressed because a teenage boy (around 16-17) had *SPAT* on her 8 year old daughter (on the top of her head) in the cinemas at Hurstville. This was at the end of movie.

The young man tried to say he coughed in the wrong direction. Coughed spit in the wrong direction. Kept apologising over and over saying it was an accident.

Long story short, the cinema management had called security and only escorted the young man and his friend off the property. Unsure if the police were called (or they didn't show up before security did, but she didnt see them at the time of the incident).

Neither he or his friend he was accompanied by had masks on at the time. The two girls they were also accompanied by, had apparently taken the young mens bags with their masks inside at the time of the incident.


She did pop over to the police station, and all they said was that they'd send a ""Liason officer"" to them to tell them not to do it again... they dont even have the identity of this young man, or his friends which made no sense why they'd try to send an officer to a group they have no chance of finding right now you know? They also said she can get her daughter tested, but it was only if her daughter tested positive for Coronavirus that they would pursue legal action.
 She will still get her tested regardless.

She asked if there was anything else she could do, but his age also played a factor in their response to this incident, so no, there wasn't much she was advised she could do, and left. 


She's gone off to get her daughter cleaned up and calmed down now, but is there anything else she can do? Or do we leave this as it is and call it a day?

**Wash your hands frequently**

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

**Maintain social distancing**

Maintain at least 1.5 metres (5 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.


**Avoid touching eyes, nose, mouth and mask**

Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

**How your survey contributes to tracking COVID-19**

We are asking the usual questions about cough and fever which are great screening symptoms for coronavirus infection. Participants who have symptoms will be asked if they received a positive test for coronavirus and whether they needed to seek medical care and had time off work or normal duties. This will give us a community level understanding of the impact of disease.

" 

I got a PCR test but my work needs me to work this weekend if at all possible. My PCR results are delayed so now I'm looking into a rapid test. But upon trying to see if they are free or not, I hit some verbage I can't quite understand. 

CVS's online policy states "" If you do not have insurance, we will ask you for your Social Security number (card not needed), driver's license or state ID to submit the cost of your test to the federal program for the uninsured. If you do not have insurance and are using the federal program for the uninsured to cover your COVID-19 test, the in-clinic visit will be covered at no additional cost to you; however, any additional point of care lab testing will not be covered under the uninsured fund. ""

I wasn't sure what to make of that.

Then one of my local hospitals AdventHealth Centra Care says this "" If you’re uninsured, your COVID-19 test will be covered under the CARES Act if you’ve been exposed to COVID-19 or have COVID-19 symptoms. If you’re uninsured and are seeking a COVID-19 test for work, travel or curiosity, you will be charged $179.00 a rapid test and/or $199.25 for a PCR test.""

This sounds like it's only free if I either have Covid, or have symptoms. Fortunately (and unfortunately in regards to this) i do not have symptoms anymore. I am getting tested to go back to work therefore it sounds like it would cost me there too.

So has anyone without insurance done either of these, or knows a nation-wide or state-wide organization that offers free rapid testing for the uninsured?"|Florida|2021|True|1

&#x200B;

Dear Governor Lee,

The time to act is now.

The Great State of Tennessee has recently surged to become the #1 hotspot for active COVID-19 cases per capita in the nation. In some Tennessee counties, almost 1 in 30 people are currently diagnosed with COVID-19.

What’s worse, if Tennessee was its own country, it would also be the #1 hotspot for active COVID-19 cases per capita in the world.

We are quickly losing valuable space in our state’s hospitals to care for the victims of this virus, and the infection rate continues to increase.

I appreciate your efforts in combating this virus through numerous executive orders and pleas to the citizens of this great state to wear masks. However, I believe we need your leadership to take these measures further.

My plea to you is to issue a statewide mask mandate. Specifically, that masks must be worn in the state of Tennessee when within 6 feet of a member of another household in indoor spaces or in outdoor spaces. We know the science behind the masks. Masks help curb the spread of COVID-19. It is a simple act that may save someone’s life.

A popular argument against masks is that they infringe on individual liberties. People know there is probably no way to actually enforce the mask mandate.  Choosing whether or not to wear a mask is still an individual choice that can be made, but the guidance needs to start at the top with you, our state’s governor.

I’m asking you to set the example and the expectation for our citizens and individual counties. Citizens, individual counties, and even our boards of health cannot be left to fend for themselves through the worst of this pandemic. We are currently failing. We need your help!

Please join your Republican governor colleagues of other states (listed below) in issuing a mask mandate for their state.

* Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas
* Eric Holcomb, Indiana
* Kim Reynolds, Iowa
* Larry Hogan, Maryland
* Charlie Baker, Massachusetts

"He still has not issued one. This last month, the county has hovered around a 1% death rate. 1 out of every 100 people who contract covid in Maury County have died. That doesn't seem like a lot to some people, but if you were offered a vaccine and the doctor told you that 1 out of every 100 doses of this vaccine will kill you.... Would you take that vaccine? 


On the same day he so said the following:

""As of yesterday, July 6, Tennessee had 653 deaths attributed to COVID-19,' Ogles said.

""To put that in perspective, Tennessee has a population of 6.82 million. Year over year, between 1,500 and 1,800 die from the seasonal flu — a virus of which we already have a vaccine. Last year in Tennessee, 1,148 individuals died in automobile accidents. And yes, I understand that COVID is not the flu, and yes I know a car is not a virus. My point is about perspective, about proportional response.""


So we were over reacting because in July only 653 had died from Covid in Tennessee despite approximately averaging 1600 deaths from the flu in TN each year. 

As if today, 11/9/20, 3,577 people have died from Covid in approximately 9 months. 

We had the fair in September and saw record attendance *face palm*

Maury Regional Hospital's icu has been full or near capacity for weeks.

WHAT. WE. ARE. CURRENTLY. DOING. IS. NOT. WORKING.

Wear a damn mask and get over yourself. The economy won't recover until Covid us under control, which it's not. Wearing a mask allows us to maintain nearly all of our day to day livelihoods. I know it's weird and annoying and uncomfortable and it sucks and I hate them! But just wear them at walmart and then take it off when you leave walmart. That's it. That's all that's being asked of you. 

I'll end my venting session with my favorite quote to pull from Ogles' statement:

"Hey all, made an offer on a house on the top of a mountain in Oahu, walking distance away from the start of a ridge trail. Will avoid saying which exact area for privacy reasons, both for me and for the offender.

Doing some more research about the neighborhood before sending in my earnest money deposit, I found some articles about feral pigs in the area. I was aware that there would be feral pigs because I have hiked these trails and seen signs allowing you to hunt them. Apparently the number of feral pigs coming down into the neighborhoods has skyrocketed in the past year, and one of the reasons is that someone is leaving huge bags of cat food out. Like a full 50 pound bag. 

I did notice that there were dozens of feral cats hanging around a neighbors house when doing viewings. This person is unmistakably feeding these cats, because in the article I read, the same street is mentioned as having the problem, and the same car is in the picture as is parked in the driveway of the home.

I'm sort of getting cold feet; I don't want a feral pig problem, or even a feral cat problem. Those both seem like they could be huge headaches, especially because the home I purchased has multiple fruit trees that the pigs would likely try to feed from. Strangely, no chickens up here (yet).

So my question is, those of you who have a feral animal problem in your area, how bad is it? If we put a fence around our property (there is none now), would that help with the problem? Can I report the person for feeding the animals? Should I just contact someone for TNR? 

I plan on going to speak with neighbors about their feelings about the strays, but there are multiple news articles calling it a nuisance from multiple times last year.

"My mom and wife both have symptoms that look a lot like COVID but both came up negative for the flu, strep, and COVID surprisingly. Symptoms include extreme fatigue, sore throat, huge headache, loss of voice, sinus issues, etc. My wife got put on anti-biotics to help with the symptoms because she tested negative for anything viral but the doc didn't specify what they think she has either. She's frustrated that just because it's not COVID doesn't mean she might not have something else so I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone else has anything similar or a similar experience recently. I appreciate it!

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses, I wanted to see if there was some sort of bug going around and it certainly seems like there is or at the very least it's some strain of COVID that is late on detection just straight up undetectable.

"(Sorry for the long post...)

I’ve posted in the past about my neighbor smoking cigarettes below me and the smell filling up my apartment. Luckily that hasn’t happened since the second time it did. I’m really glad it hasn’t. 

My apartment fills up with the smells of cooking/burning smells from apartments below me. To the point where my head feels foggy and all my fabrics absorb the smell. I’ve lived in apartments where you could smell other people cooking, and it was tolerable. I don’t mind the temporary cooking smells, but this is to the point where my *entire* apartment is filled with a strange haze and intense (almost burnt?) smell. It doesn’t go away, either. It just lingers for at least a day or two. Like, this is NOT normal...

It didn’t used to be like this in the summer and I wonder if it has to do with all of us keeping our windows closed now, everything just floats around inside? The ventilation here is clearly horrible and I didn’t think about how much worse it would get in winter. 

I feel lucky to have a place but honestly, I’m so depressed being here. I’ve noticed that my sinuses have gotten bad since I’ve moved in, my skin isn’t as good as it used to be, headaches start when the cooking/brining smell doesn’t escape, and I’m so fatigued. I’m sure there are many things that play into that—I’m not saying it’s all because of the apartment. But I do know that I’ve never felt this shitty living somewhere due to structural issues. I can’t even open my windows anymore when the smell gets bad because it’s too cold out. And my air purifier can’t keep up, so I’m just sitting here absorbing burnt smells that won’t seem to leave my unit. 

I’m at a loss for what to do. This might not sound like a big deal to some but because I’m in my apartment everyday during quarantine, I feel like I have no way to escape. I’m starting to wonder if buying out my lease (which is $$$$$) would be worth it instead of growing more depressed by the day here (I have 6 months left on my lease). At first I thought it was just quarantine, but over time I’m realizing what impact old apartments can have on your health especially if they’re not maintained well like mine. 

I’m not upset with my neighbors—it’s not their fault at all. My landlord said someone could come and seal the pipes but I *know* that isn’t enough. This feels like a much bigger ventilation problem and would require way more than sealing pipes. 

I don’t know what I’m asking exactly, but if you have experienced something similar I’d love to hear how it was resolved. I’m not the most financially stable rn and would hate to pay a large sum to leave, but I’m feeling really lost on what to do. 

Please hold back from posting rude comments, I’m really at my lowest here. I’ve never felt so depressed. Thank you ❤️"|seattle|2020|True|0
"We were lucky enough to get a house last spring (Feb 2021). However, the house was a fixer upper. Actually a complete re-doer. The house is over 100 years old and the past 3 family’s who have lived in it have been borderline hoarders. 

We’ve put everything into this house - all of our savings, all of our extra money every month, and since we did all of the work ourselves, all of our free time. We haven’t taken vacations or had much extra to enjoy through the month since getting this house. I’m grateful to have a home, especially with the housing marketing being what it is. But fixing this house up to make it even liveable has been a lot. 

We’re at the point now where we’re sick of Utah and want to move out of state. Should we sell the house and pay off debt and have some savings? Or rent the house out? We’re finishing up the last of the renovations and then it will be ready to rent or sell-  whichever we want.

"I've lived in my current residence for six years. We've had some dry years lately, but some heavy storms too. I've never had an issue with my mail carrier refusing to deliver my mail after a storm. I've always been able to clear the door and sides of the mailbox, shovel a bit of the bank away, and move on with life. My mail has always gotten delivered.

This year has been... different. It started a while back when I became suspicious of the mailbox being empty for multiple days and called. Turns out they were holding my mail (thanks for telling me!) because our mailbox was too snowed in. Well... alright, I guess I will go shovel it out some more. I called and said all was well, so the next day I went out expecting to see a week's worth of mail-- only to find another empty box! Wtf! I had to shovel it out even more-- which was back-breaking because it was set into an icebank-- before the carrier decided it was good enough.

I had to go through this again with another big storm, and it's happening *yet again* with this past one. What even the fuck? What happened to my old mail carrier who just wanted a clear door so he could stick the mail in? 

It wouldn't even be a terribly big deal except I get a number of pretty important prescriptions through a mail-order pharmacy, so it can get to be a pretty big problem when this happens.

Every single day there's a new article about how refugees are good, how we should be taking them in, etc. despite other articles run on the same exact day about how the economy in this state is bad, more places are closing, and we have more poverty than ever before.

It's like they know that we have no money here, but would rather take money from their fellow citizens to give to people ""from away"" that have never paid into the system, will leech off of the welfare like the Somalis did in lewiston, and will never, ever, integrate into society.

OLIVIA IRELAND DECEMBER 01, 2021

Mrs Kim's Donuts in Kingston has been closed. Picture: Elesa Kurtz Mrs Kim's Donuts in Kingston has been closed. Picture: Elesa Kurtz

Dylan Hayne was a customer who bought a six pack of doughnuts for his partner Olivia Corkery's birthday on Wednesday, November 24, which they believe is what caused them to become severely ill.

""For days we had really bad food poisoning with dehydration, migraines, a lot of vomiting and diarrhoea. We couldn't drink any water or keep food down until dinner a few days ago on Monday 29. It was agonising for both of us.

""We connected the dots it was likely the doughnut restaurant because it was the only thing both Olivia and myself had eaten together and we saw other people post their experience from the same place in a Canberra forum.""

The couple had travelled to Sydney before symptoms to visit family for the first time in months, which Olivia said was ruined.

""I was really mad, because I'd organised a dinner with my friends, they were all eating and drinking while I couldn't because I was so sick, I just wanted to have a good birthday,"" Ms Corkery said.

""The restaurant could have at least shut down and apologised to people who reported symptoms earlier because it possibly could have prevented us from getting sick later.

""We have had no contact from the business, they just completely disappeared which makes us feel the restaurant doesn't care they possibly made hundreds of people sick.""

Mrs Kim's sold up to 1000 doughnuts a day during lockdown, which raises speculation from customers on how many more Canberrans have experienced symptoms.

Other people have reported suffering more extreme symptoms that led to being admitted in the emergency ward, including stomach pain, vomiting and fevers.

Reports of vomiting every five to 10 minutes for several hours that led to a loss of consciousness and sleeping on the bathroom floor also occurred.

The only way customers like Mr Hayne and Ms Corkery were able to understand why they all got sick was through one common link of eating doughnuts at the same shop.

ACT Health confirmed some people had been treated at hospital and is running an ongoing investigation, interviewing each claim of food poisoning.

""As at 3pm on December 1, 2021, approximately 130 people have been identified as experiencing similar symptoms that may be attributable to the same source. Symptoms have generally resolved after 48 hours,"" a government spokesperson said.

"Two weeks ago, I started to feel ""off"". Very fatigued, fevery feeling (but thermometer broke so don't know), and scratchy throat. The fevery feeling and scratchy throat went away after three days or so.

Since then, the fatigue has continued/worsened and I have continual headaches and brain fog. And the worst symptom is a dry, unproductive cough that will. Not. Stop. I regularly fall into extreme coughing fits, especially at night, which means I am not getting sleep.

I have tested negative for Covid (testing center) (EDIT: PCR test), so I am wondering if the test is wrong? Or are others of you out there suffering a prolonged experience with an awful cough from something else?"|seattle|2022|True|1

Fire calls are up a little with smoke or house fires, due to I am guessing people being home more or having to learn to cook. MVCS are down also.

"**This post will be flagged NSFW as it talks about unethical and downright terrible things that have occurred in this state. I am unaware if this deserves an NSFW tag but for the sake of not knowing I will flag it that way.**

Hello, over a semester at my university, I have participated in a course that goes over the history of eugenics and forced sterilization in North Carolina and abroad in the United States and the world. My class was responsible for researching a topic on eugenics, looking into databases and libraries finding primary and secondary sources. In doing so I found out more about my state myself than I had ever been taught in public school and I was not aware that this was part of my state's history. This information has kept me up at night wondering if anyone else knows about this history and if they would like to read about it. 

My topic focused on the public reaction to the unveiling of the state's eugenic past in the early 2000s when Johanna Schoen and the *Winston-Salem Journal* published articles about the subject after countless hours researching medical records and databases.

In this post, I will provide a timeline, a list of important facts to add to that timeline, and a works cited page from my paper which assisted me in writing more than 16 pages for my professor. The works cited will be provided so that anyone can check the evidence on my facts or do some reading themselves about this part of the state's history.

The majority of my sources are from Johanna Schoen's book:  *Choice & Coercion: Birth Control, Sterilization, and Abortion in Public* *Health and Welfare*. Along with another book with numerous authors: Kevin Begos et al., *Against Their Will: North Carolina’s Sterilization Program.*  

Further sources are newspaper articles, government forms, and numerous other primary and secondary sources. Some sources may not be able to be listed for the sake of keeping my university and myself anonymous as sources were taken from databases given with access from the university. 

Parts of this post will have been directly copied and pasted from my very own paper to save myself time and ensure that the points remain coherent.

This will be likely my only post on Reddit unless I find something else monumental in my history classes that I need to share with the people of this state.

The history of eugenics, originating in a belief that humans can improve the quality of their genetic makeup by medical means such as sterilization and reproduction control took its effect in North Carolina and the United States in the 19th century.  

**Important Facts Before Reading Timeline:**

* North Carolina sterilized more than 7,000 people within the time the law allowing for eugenic sterilizations was created when it was repealed. This is according to a Carolina Times article published in 2002, the third most of all the states. **( ""Sterilization Program Targeted Women, Blacks in Later Years in State.""** ***The Carolina Times, December*** **21, 2002.** [**https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn83045120/2002-12-21/ed-1/seq-11/**](https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn83045120/2002-12-21/ed-1/seq-11/)**.  )**
* More than 2,000 people 18 and younger were also sterilized.
* Decisions on sterilizations came down to the State Eugenics Board more often than not but there were also cases of sterilizations being performed without the Eugenics Board approval.
* North Carolina is unique in the way it implemented eugenic policies following the law's implementation upon its citizens outside of mental institutions in that social workers were used to threaten and coerce individuals to sterilize themselves or members of their families.  **( ""Winston Salem Chronicle. ""** ***Winston-Salem Chronicle*****, August 9, 2007.** [**Winston-Salem chronicle. (Winston-Salem, N.C.) 1974-current, August 09, 2007, Page A12, Image 12 · North Carolina Newspapers (digitalnc.org)**](https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn85042324/2007-08-09/ed-1/seq-12/#words=eugenic+Eugenics+eugenics)**.  )**  The welfare department of North Carolina reduced the amount of aid given to families by encouraging their social workers to encourage mothers and families to sterilize themselves if they were in a poor financial situation.12 
* Social workers often pitted a young individual’s fertility against her family’s access to state benefits, forcing families to choose between having the money for food to feed themselves or sacrificing a major part of life. In doing this social workers also took advantage of a family's lack of knowledge about sterilization and illiteracy when having to gain their consent. Often parents did not know what they were signing and ended up giving away their relative's reproductive freedom. **( Kevin Begos et al.,** ***Against Their Will: North Carolina’s Sterilization Program.*** **Apalachicola, Florida: Gray Oak Books, 2012. 17.  )**
*  Elaine Riddick Jessie was a girl who was raped by her neighbor and then later sterilized by the Eugenics Board at the age of 13 in 1968. Jessie underwent an IQ test and received a 75 which was above the North Carolina instituted minimum for “feeblemindedness"" of 70. Instead of using her score, the Judge and Jury used other low IQ scores as a baseline and vague descriptions of potential deviant behaviors. She was issued with a mental disability and then sterilized by the courts to prevent” mental defects” from entering the population. This is due to a view that African American women were sexually deviant and feebleminded, if the testing did not match that view then the test scores would be omitted. ( **Hamer, Quinlan, and Grano. ""’Tired and Hungry’ in North Carolina: A Critical Approach to Contesting Eugenic Discourse.""  )** 
* Sterilization victims did not often know they had been sterilized until they had tried to have children of their own. An example is from a Leland Resident Elnora Millis who was not aware that she was sterilized until she tried to have children. ( [Payments to eugenics victims still up in the air as budget process drags on (wral.com)](https://www.wral.com/story/payments-to-eugenics-victims-still-up-in-the-air-as-budget-process-drags-on/14903605/) ) ( [Court battle holds up payments to victims of NC sterilization program (wral.com)](https://www.wral.com/story/court-battle-holds-up-payments-to-victims-of-nc-sterilization-program/16218271/) )

**Timeline:**

* North Carolina passed eugenic laws in 1929 and rewrote them in 1933 allowing three reasons for sterilization: epilepsy, sickness, and feeble-mindedness. **( ""Sterilization Program Targeted Women, Blacks in Later Years in State.""** ***The Carolina Times, December*** **21, 2002.** [**https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn83045120/2002-12-21/ed-1/seq-11/**](https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn83045120/2002-12-21/ed-1/seq-11/)**.  )**
* State Courts and legislatures were encouraged to pass these laws because of a previous Supreme Court case which occurred in **1927**, *Buck V Bell*. In the *Buck V Bell* case, it was interpreted by the court in such a way that sterilization violated no substantive rights and did not violate the Constitution. Oliver Holmes, the justice who wrote the decision, “affirmed that the value of a law like Virginia’s in order to prevent the nation from ‘being swamped with incompetence … Three Generations of imbeciles are enough.’”  **( ""Buck v. Bell.""** ***Oyez.*** [**https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/274us200**](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/274us200)**.  )**
*  In the late **1940s**, the Department of Public Welfare began to promote increased sterilization as one of the several solutions to poverty and illegitimacy. **( NC Department of Administration. NC Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation Brochure. Raleigh, NC: Office of Justice for Sterilization Victims, 2014.** [**https://www.doa.nc.gov/jsv/js-brochure/download**](https://www.doa.nc.gov/jsv/js-brochure/download)  **)**
* Around 77% of those sterilized in North Carolina took place after World War Two. **( CNN. “Forced Sterilization Victims Open Up,” June 22, 2011.** [**https://youtu.be/qaQQHuwqg6A?si=zM\_uTHjFcPWQ-G9E**](https://youtu.be/qaQQHuwqg6A?si=zM_uTHjFcPWQ-G9E)  **)** There was also a rise in sterilizations taking place outside of mental institutions in the late 1950s which led to an increased use of social workers.   
* In the **1950s** an organization called the ""Human Betterment League"" was influential in disseminating information to the citizens of North Carolina about eugenics and the positives of sterilization. In doing this they sent out pamphlets, one notably being named “You Wouldn’t Expect” and sent them to homes in North Carolina to obtain donations and give information about how sterilization benefits mentally defectives while saving taxpayer dollars and protecting the community. **( The Human Betterment League.** ***You Wouldn’t Expect*****. Winston Salem, NC: The Human Betterment League, 1950.**  [**You wouldn't expect-- : Human Betterment League of North Carolina : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive**](https://archive.org/details/youwouldntexpect00huma/page/n3/mode/2up) 
*  The **1950s and 1960s** were a time when racial inequality was being tested and implemented with the Jim Crow laws and later the civil rights movement. Black women underwent more sterilizations than any other race as time went on since the start of sterilization in North Carolina. *The Carolina Times* in 2002 article states, ”The program had been racially balanced in the early years, but by the late 1960s more than 60 percent of those who were sterilized were black, and 99 percent were women.” **( “Sterilization Program Targeted Women, Blacks in later Years in State.”** ***The Carolina Times,*** **December 21, 2002. ) ( Theo Helm, ”Class Played a Role in Eugenic Sterilizations, Researcher Says.”** ***Winston Salem Journal*****, April 11, 2003, Gale OneFile: News. OneFile.  )**
* Following the civil rights movement and in the 1970s, the ideals of eugenics and the eugenics board itself started to lessen more and more as the years went on. **(Kevin Begos et al.** ***Against Their Will,*** **30 )** The eugenics board quietly worked in the background, often away from the eyes of the governor and regular citizens as it was only a five-member board from five distinct agencies in North Carolina.  
* Members of the board often changed from the heads of the five agencies to lowly staff members to represent their interests on the board. When these lowly staff members were placed on the board, they “didn‘t get crash courses in child behavior or the effects of environment on IQ before joining.“ (**Kevin Begos et al.** ***Against Their Will,*** **31.**)   Members such as Bonnie Allred who represented the state director of social services on the board felt that they were playing God because they had power over an individual's reproduction. **( Kevin Begos et al.** ***Against Their Will,*** **170. )**
* Measures were implemented by Clifton Craig who was the chairman of the Eugenics Board at the time to delegate more power to local officials to determine sterilization cases, before a sterilization would be approved under his board there were more requirements for documentation and evidence.
* These changes caused a declining rate of sterilization petitions to the board, assisted by the new public attention that had come from the lawsuits of Elaine Riddick Jessie and Nial Cox Ramirez towards the eugenics board, seeking damages for their forced sterilization. These lawsuits were not successful but gained attention from Caspar Weinberger who was the secretary of health, education, and welfare for President Richard Nixon. This pressure from outside the board ultimately led to the legislature of North Carolina dismantling the board in **1974** and giving the power to order sterilizations to the district court judges. **( Kevin Begos et al.** ***Against Their Will,*** **174. )**
*  Over time between the 1974 dismantling of the eugenics board and the new awareness of eugenics in the early 2000s, it was made known that District Court Judges still had the power to order sterilizations although the power was rarely ever used. **( Kevin Begos et al.** ***Against Their Will,*** **179.  )**
* Republican State House Representative Larry Womble worked to revoke the judicial power to order sterilizations and succeeded in **March of 2003** with the assistance of hearings from Elaine Riddick Jessie and Nial Cox Ramirez who told their story.
* Upon the release of information and public awareness about the eugenics past of North Carolina, Governor Mark Easly created a committee to investigate that part of our history. Compensation talks would continue until 2009 when funding was put into a foundation that would assist in the identification of sterilization victims and potentially give out compensation later on. This foundation would be known as the **Office of Justice for Sterilization Victims**( [Welcome to the Office of Justice for Sterilization Victims | NC DOA](https://www.doa.nc.gov/about-doa/special-programs/welcome-office-justice-sterilization-victims) ) 
* The Office of Justice for Sterilization Victims produced forms and brochures giving the public information about eugenics and provided a system where individuals could see if one of their family members was sterilized. Later forms for compensation would only cover sterilizations done by the eugenics board when there were cases of sterilizations being done locally without the eugenics board's awareness. **( Mennel, Eric. “Payments Start for N.C. Eugenics Victims, But Many Won’t Qualify.” NPR, October 31, 2014.** [**https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/10/31/360355784/payments-start-for-n-c-eugenics-victims-but-many-wont-qualify**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/10/31/360355784/payments-start-for-n-c-eugenics-victims-but-many-wont-qualify)**.  )**
*  In **2011** the state put 25 million dollars towards a pier following Hurricane Isabel which occurred in 2003.(  **Kevin Begos et al.** ***Against Their Will,*** **222.** ) This caused discontent among the public as sterilization victims were getting older and older but despite the money being put towards a foundation supporting victims in 2009, little else had been done. 
* Additionally, **in 2011**, Democrats and Republicans debated over a tobacco settlement while using sterilization compensation as a bargaining chip. Governor Perdue and members of the democratic party wanted the money from the tobacco settlement to go towards the economy but to get republican votes for that she had to put money forward for sterilization compensation. ( **Kevin Begos et al.** ***Against Their Will,*** **224.**  )
* Ultimately, with the dedication of former State Rep. Larry Womble, and House Speaker Thom Tillis, and other individuals in the state legislature, compensation legislation was able to be passed despite politics being involved **in 2013**. Thom Tillis on his website representing him as a current Senator from North Carolina, a press release from his time as speaker said the following  **“In 2013,** North Carolina became the first state in the nation to pass legislation to create a state fund to compensate the living victims of the state-run forced sterilization program.” **(**  **”Senate Passes Bipartisan Bill to Assist Eugenics Victims Receiving Compensation Payments.” Thom Tillis, U.S Senator for North Carolina, December 1, 2015.**  )
* Legislation for compensation passed in **2013** and victims received their first payment in **2014**, then their second payment in **2015**, and then their final payment in **2018** indicating a 5-year period where the state was able to pay back aging victims like Millis who may have needed immediate funding for their medical issues. ( “Final Compensation Check Sent to NC Sterilization Victims.” AP News, February 8, 2018.  [Final compensation check sent to NC sterilization victims | AP News](https://www.apnews.com/article/b40b5584543d498fb1fea29b97aced4e)   )
* Ultimately, the state legislature did its job in paving the way for compensation to be given to victims, and the state Department of Administration which was responsible for giving out the money was held up by the courts as they were trying to address appeals by victims for more money. Compensation for victims came down to the bureaucracy of the state of North Carolina and the layers that had to be passed to give this money out.  

**My Conclusion from my Paper:**

 The history of eugenics in North Carolina from its inception to the removal of sterilization powers from the Eugenics Board and then the Judiciary is something that could not have been discovered without the media and the work of Johanna Schoen, and other writers. 

The unearthing of this history is a representation of the power of the U.S. Constitution and the power of a free media in checking the government's power over the people. This history does not receive the attention it deserves in today's media, today's public schools, and by the state government since compensation payments were issued. It is the responsibility of educators and individuals who are aware of this history to make others aware at any given opportunity to show the power of free media as a check on civil rights.  

Many of the sources in this paper came from local newspapers and state newspapers instead of national newspapers which have become the most prevalent sources of information for people. Local newspapers are necessary due to the connection to the community that a national newspaper simply cannot, a local newspaper often has people from the community while a national newspaper has an overarching arrangement of people from many parts of the country. 

Without the connection to the community that the *Winston-Salem Journal* had, and other local newspapers had in publishing information about North Carolina's eugenics past then a national newspaper would have been less likely to cover it and make it a nationwide issue as sterilization was not limited to North Carolina.  

**Final Remarks:**

Sterilization in North Carolina has not been a topic talked about in the wide media since the end of compensation payments in 2018. For the sake of public knowledge and for the sake of history not repeating itself, we must know our history as a state and as a country. Many more facts and information are out there about the eugenics past of North Carolina, I encourage anyone who reads this post to go out there and find more info.

"I wanted to take a moment to share what I have been through over the last week so those that are experiencing so sort of illness can compare their symptoms and take appropriate measures for care.

This has been one of the most intresting illnesses I have had in my entire life as it has not followed the norms… I ended up having to go to the ER on day 5 and get tested, IV fluids, Tamiflu and cough medicine because of a sudden turn around in my symptoms. This is what has happened day by day and I’m still not 100%.

Day 1 through 3 - Nausea, Fatigue, Dizziness, Lower GI Issues, & Light Headedness. 

Day 4 - Seen an improvement in the lower GI symptoms and was able to do a little more than I had been the prior days but was still tired and had nausea with the dizziness and fatigue. I thought I was getting better and out of the woods.. I was wrong

Day 5 - Before bed I started to get an itchy throat and then I started coughing really bad and my temperature spiked to almost 103 out of nowhere. Took 1000mg of Tylenol to try and get it down but it only got down to 101. I could not stop coughing. The coughing turned into me expelling about 24 oz of fluid/phlegm in a short period of time. I was extremely fatigued, dizzy and felt horrible. On top of it all I could not sleep to save my life. My throat was also on fire.. it felt like my vocal cords had been shred.

Up until this day I did not have any cough or fever at all. This prompted me to go to the ER and get tested and then they gave me all the things I stated above and diagnosed me with Influenza A. Honestly I was surprised as the flu normally attacks the respiratory track 1st. I sprained all my rib muscles from the amount of coughing I did in such a short amount of time, and that was honestly the most painful part. I had to take a blanket and wrap it around my chest and pull it tight behind me to make it easier to cough or sneeze it hurts so bad.

Day 6 - less coughing, no fever, chest congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes. Dizziness, light headedness. No long periods of sleep 3 hours or less at a time. Really more like 2. My Chest was the most painful this day and my voice still was weak.

Day 7 - (Today) Woke up feeling a little better. finally slept around 7 hours straight but woke up covered in sweat. I have felt ok but fatigued as long as Im resting, but when I get up to walk Im still dizzy and light headed. The stomach pain has returned and I feel like the lower GI issues may come back. I had a bloody plug come out of my nasal passage, but no runny nose and minimal chest congestion. It came and went as quick as the onset of my new symptoms on day 5. My voice is still cracked and weak as well.

I feel like tomorrow I will feel better or at least I can only hope it will. I hope this is helpful for those that may not be sure what’s going on if they are having similar symptoms. I will say that my friend ended up getting this as he spent the night with us and he started off his first day with vomiting. My fiancé and I did not and we are still sick. my friend on the other hand has made a recovery. Same with my son. He had vomiting for one day and now he is better. 

Over all I thought it was covid at first, but nope it was the Flu. A very tricky strain that seems to affect everyone very differently."|NorthCarolina|2023|True|1
"I’m (35m) wondering if anyone has a recommendation for a solid physical therapist in the denver area.  Summary of my pain/symptom history over the past ~ 8 years  includes:
>Outer knee pain (assumed IT band) while running.
>Femeroacetabular impingement diagnosis and hip arthroscopy / labral repair in 2019 (didn’t fix any of my symptoms)
>TFL / psoas seem to be chronically tight and often/easily get aggravated
>Sitting for extended periods causes a lot of pain in the front of my hips (for example, long flights are terrible and I have started taking opioids for such situations)
>lower back pain has been increasing recently and I assume is related to tight iliopsoas muscles 
>standing / slow walking sucks - knee/back pain

I’ve been to a few PTs (including Select PT in Greenwood Village, Peak PT on Hampden, Next Level in Golden, JointWorx in Avon) and haven’t found long term improvement.  I’m not expecting anything to be fixed with a 6-week script of exercises, nor am I looking for someone to throw a standard script at me. My self diagnosis is that my body has learned to function inefficiently(/incorrectly?), I have muscles overcompensating/mis-firing, and I need to retrain my body how to move properly.  I’m looking for someone to help me do so, as I keep hitting a wall with standard PT approaches, online programs, self-guided stretching/strengthening, etc. Needless to say, it’s had a serious impact on my overall health and level of activity.

Any recommendations or tips from folks with similar experiences are greatly appreciated.  Thanks!"|Denver|2023|True|0
Hi! I haven’t been diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome officially, but my mom (60) has a lot of symptoms, my sister (27)  has POTS, and I (36 F) had a Vertebral Artery Dissection that caused a baby stroke. I know I can’t really do anything about it, but it would still be nice to know. Are there doctors here that can diagnose? Do I do nothing? 🤷🏽‍♀️|Denver|2023|True|0
"My beloved pup, Worf, isn't feeling well. Definitely something off, but my payroll company messed up my paycheck so I'm straight broke until next week, unless I find a very affordable place in Denver, I'm not sure what to do. I feel like these symptoms are pretty serious and I'm thinking he's going into kidney failure. He has a long history of eating things he shouldn't/destructive. 

Labored breathing
Panting 
Increased thirst 
Increased urine production 
Distended belly 
Loss of bladder control 

Have any of your dogs had kidney failure and what were the symptoms? Where did you take them that you recommend? The two of us moved down from Longmont recently so I don't have a vet here yet.

"About 6 years ago I had ACL and MCL reconstruction surgery (patellar tendon graft for ACL and hamstring graft for MCL).  The surgery was a success and most days I have no symptoms in terms of pain or stiffness.  However maybe once or twice a month my hamstring and/or knee is just 'mad' at me.  

I've found that a topical CBD/THC balm helps calm everything down and after a day of rest everything is back to normal.  Curious if anyone else has a favorite brand or product they would recommend.  Last time I just went to a random dispensary and asked themwhat to get.  

I live in Arvada if that helps but don't mind driving a bit to get a better product

"My roommate (who struggles with seasonal affective disorder and general mental health) is starting to stagnate inside, and last night I was trying to figure out how we could alleviate a little bit of the cabin-fever problem.  I suggested going to Memorial Park to take a walk under the trees, but he said that all Omaha parks are closed.  My husband said the same thing.  I understand closing playgrounds, but closing walking trails and such seems like a death sentence to people who can’t cope with being indoors all of the time.  

I suppose I’m questioning whether or not this is true.  Does anyone have information?  Are they really telling us not to go on walks and such?  What about people with dogs?"|Omaha|2020|True|0

I’ve been feeling sick lately, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue, haven’t checked my temperature so idk about fever, but i asked my job if i could self isolate and quarantine myself while getting unemployment, and after two days they demanded that i come back to work or get a doctors note. I work as a janitor sanitizing buildings and cleaning in multiple different accounts and have been exposed to multiple ”compromised” rooms (like a classroom of a teacher who tested positive for the virus, i don’t know how long its lasts lingering around rooms so idk about it being still contaminated). That’s a lot of text but my question is can they keep me working like this? they aren’t forcing me to work but they won’t lay me off, and without being laid off i can’t collect unemployment which is necessary to pay my rent and living costs. I live in Las Vegas nevada if that makes any difference. Thank you|LasVegas|2020|True|1
He has a fever, sore throat and cough, they swabbed him for testing at HCMC but told him there are about 1,700 other people waiting to be tested in front of him because of the lack of test kits. So in the meantime he’s supposed to stay in his apartment for 14 days and call the hospital (not 911) if his symptoms get worse. Take care of yourself, people.|Minnesota|2020|True|1
"Fresh new data analysis, not because things are getting better, but because knowing your fate is much less unnerving than trying to guess.  Also the main conclusion of all this analysis is STILL:

STAY AT HOME AND SOCIAL DISTANCE UNTIL TESTING RAMPS UP. If that doesn't continue, we will never get ahead of this.

Just a reminder of the previous post, everything comes down to testing. Until we can test about 2% of the population randomly things won't get back to normal (everything changes if spread rate doesn't decrease though).  For Minnesota that is about 100K/month.  As of 3/19 Minnesota is testing 12K/month, progress from the 3K/month we were testing last week.

The rest of this is sausage making.  If you want the boiler plate interpretation of what is going on there are tons of good sources out there.  If you want to be able to predict more accurately, or with more granularity what might happen, and in particular ask the questions no one is asking (e.g., What is your plan to randomly test and clear geographic regions in your state?) then you need to dig deeper.

Now we have enough data from multiple states to start to granularizing their progress.  The next few weeks we are going to see some states handle this thing really well, and others aren't.

First is the table summarizing all pertinent statistics as of 3/19.  You can see, MN ranks 5th in testing (by % population).  Testing also must be considered in relation to spread status, so obviously states that are further along have more testing and more cases (like WA and NY).  The best place to be on this list is lots of testing and not a lot of positives.

HOWEVER...there are likely a lot of states with unknown numbers of positives so this must be considered carefully.  For example FL has a low number of cases, because it hasn't tested a lot and it is a prime location for community spread.

One other interesting observation.  I plotted % positive rate of population vs relative % of population tested.  This illustrates a clear trend of the undertesting that is going on (read: positive percentages for a majority of states do not represent the number of actual positive cases in that state, rather the percentage of cases which have COVID-19 like symptoms which are actually COVID.  Those states all fall in a linear grouping near the origin.) Based on this the ONLY states where the COVID-19 testing might actually be representative of reality to some degree are WA, VT, SD, ME, and MN.   


COVID-19 cases in all other states bear little resemblance to reality.  This will transition from a national emergency into a granularized emergency in various states and cities.  Some areas will be just fine if they properly mitigate spread now.

All data is sourced from [https://covidtracking.com/](https://covidtracking.com/)

The rest I leave to you to interpret with a table and two figures.

We are finally starting to get significant numbers of tests so we are now actually able to test more than just the people that are looking the worst or have been in contact with someone that is already diagnosed.  We WILL have many more positive tests, a lot of which will be people who show no symptoms and finally are getting tested.  This should not be a surprise or a scare but it will be a reality check for a lot of people.

"**EDIT** 4:30pm on day 5, we have a result! Thank god I'm negative. I can get back to work, without risk to my patients. I’m so glad. ❤️

Original: 

Ok, I don’t know where to let out my frustration on this.

I am a health care worker, I started showing symptoms last Friday. I went home, self-isolated and started the process to get approved for testing.

I was tested Sat morning as soon as the clinic opened.

I *still* don’t have results, and I can’t get ahold of anyone at the clinic.

I do get it: they are overwhelmed. I’m sure they have their own staff out sick, which is making the situation worse. But this is day four, and I don’t know if it’s safe for me to return to work. I don’t know if I need to warn all the patients I saw last week (although, at this point, it’s probably too late anyways).

Four+ days for results is ridiculous."|Minnesota|2020|True|1
"Hey all,

I'm a practicing ER doc here in the Twin Cities area.  Here are some thoughts on testing, COVID 19, and your local hospital/ER situation.

Things right now aren't too bad in local hospitals -- emphasis on RIGHT NOW.  If the experience of Italy and Seattle are any indication (and, likely in the next 1-2 weeks, NYC and the SF area), things are likely to rapidly, rapidly change, for the worse.  We aren't seeing rationing of health care resources in the US yet, but all of us in the field see what's happening in Italy and we all are dreading what is possible.

We are expecting a HUGE uptick in people flooding the EDs in the state, either because they are concerned they might have COVID19, or because they called their PCP or nurseline and were advised to go to the ED for an evaluation.

Right now, we are still in regular old cold/flu season.  Regular cold and flu are still much, much more common than COVID19 -- and just as capable of giving you the same symptoms of fever, cough, body aches, difficulty breathing, nausea and vomiting.  If you show up to the ED with these concerns, you will be cordoned off from the general population and cohorted with everyone else with the same respiratory/infectious symptoms.  Well, what happens if you actually just have the flu?  You might be placed next to someone who legitimately has COVID19.  Boom, you just increased your own personal risk of contracting COVID19, as well as the risk of bringing it back home to everyone that you know and love.

If your symptoms are severe, especially if there is a large shortness of breath component, BY ALL MEANS, GO TO THE HOSPITAL OR CALL 911.  No question.  But if your symptoms are mild, or if you just want a test, the ED is the very, very last place you are going to want to be in the next few weeks.  Trust me.  It's the last place I want to be too, for my family's sake.  But I have to be there.  You don't.

For people in the Twin Cities area, several health systems are rolling out drive through testing programs.  [Oncare.org](https://Oncare.org) is the entrypoint to M Health Fairview's system, and there are (as of right now) no out of pocket costs for testing.  I believe HCMC and the Mayo system are also rolling out drive through or drive-up testing sites.  If your symptoms are mild, or if you just want to know because of a possible exposure, this may prevent spread of this disease.

STAY HEALTHY EVERYONE!!!

"From the press conference yesterday, it sounds like MDH is using their influenza monitoring to also monitor for COVID.  It seems that what they are doing is taking patients who are hospitalized with respiratory illness, and in addition to testing them for influenza they are now testing them for COVID.

First, that's a great step and I applaud them for doing it.

**HOWEVER**, it seems that MDH is taking the lack of COVID in these tests to mean that we do not have pervasive community spread. This is an extremely dangerous false-negative and shows a misunderstanding of how this disease actually works.

The CDC has published\[a\] the following:

>Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.\[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot02),[5](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot05)\] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). \[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot02)\] In another report, **the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.**\[[1](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot01)\] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. \[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot02),[4](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot04)\] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.\[[3](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot03)\]

(Emphasis added)

What this means, is that we will not see COVID cases showing up in our hospitals until at least a week *after* those cases become infected.  But we have evidence\[b\] showing that **COVID-infected people are most contagious during their first weeks of infection - before they are hospitalized**:

>Samples from the patients’ throats revealed that the virus was most infectious during the 1st week after the person had contracted it. This was the case with 16.66% of throat swabs and 83.33% sputum (saliva and mucus) samples.

Therefore, once we see infections showing up in this hospital-based monitoring, **it will be too late.** Those patients will have been contagious for a median of 8 days before hospitalization and testing. This means that the disease will have already spread in the community.

The MDH and the governor must take more decisive action, using the force of law to ban all gatherings over 250 people, shut down all universities, mandate work-from-home for all those who can do so, and require workplaces that cannot work from home to implement staggered start times (or, ideally, staggered shifts).

These actions are already being taken by other states. We have ample warning and we still have the opportunity to save lives; we musn't squander it.

I accepted a job offer in early March.  Background and employment verification are being done through a third party company.  Every part of it is done except for the cook county background check.  It keeps getting delayed and delayed even though I and the company hiring me have called several times to get things moving.  

I know cook county has been seeing delays, but this is ridiculous.  I've been waiting over a month and can't start until the background comes back.  

From things I read, there are terminals at the courthouse where records can get looked up.  But the third party company tells me they're waiting for a response from the county.  Who's telling the truth?  Is it cook county or is it the third party company just being lazy?

Anyways, I'm sick and tired of this because I want to leave my job, AND I'm getting paid significantly more at the next company.

I was on Chicago crossing Halsted, I had the green and the walk light, and TWO cars in a row just zoomed right through making left turns with absolutely no regard to my presence whatsoever. The second one stopped JUST in time just short of me I could touch their hood, so I reflexively yelled out to them ""What the FUCK!?!? Do you not see I have the light?!?"" They didn't even seem like they cared.

Just a month ago I had two separate similar instances. Had the green, crossing the street, car comes zooming into a left turn and has to swerve or brake and then honks at me like I'M the asshole. WTF!?

This shit happens ALL the time, not the super close calls like that but cars just completely disregarding pedestrians crossing on the green, and I'm getting pretty sick of it.

WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, PEOPLE. YOU'RE IN A TWO TON KILLING MACHINE.

I don't expect to accomplish anything at all with this post but I'm pretty livid and just venting. Sorry for the cursing.

&#x200B;

Edit: Okay so I did NOT expect this post to blow up like this so I want to add a few clarifying points for the people defending shitty drivers and insinuating that somehow I'm to blame...

\-Yes, I know, ""Welcome to Chicago."" Thanks, I've lived here most of my life.

\-I'm not an idiot just walking right out into traffic arrogantly asserting my right of way with no fucks given. I follow the lights and the rules of the road. I don't wear headphones or use my phone when actively walking, certainly not in the damn street. I stay very vigilant and am very aware of my surroundings, but cars are going at LEAST 10x faster than I am. It takes literally less than a second for anything to happen.

\-There are no left turn lights at that intersection. I was already halfway across the road. The cars in question were coming eastbound as I was crossing west and just zoomed right through since there was probably a break in or no westbound traffic, and I'm assuming they were impatiently trying to make the light and not paying attention to the crosswalk.

\-I know this kind of thing comes with the territory of dense urban living, but that doesn't make it okay. I can rant about whatever I damn well please, if you don't like it then move on."|Chicago|2022|True|0

"Hi all, 

I'm planning on coming to australia in the next year and have some questions about the job market. Currently work med-surg at a busy inner city hospital in vancouver. From what I've read I'll probably try for public hospitals before private.

1) What are the major acute hospitals ? Currently I'm working in an ""inner city"" hospital that specializes in homeless/injection drug use population among others. I don't know if it's the same in aus, but I'm looking for the major acute hospital that DOESN'T specialize in this population. I just want sick. I can roll with the violent/behavioral patients from time to time but would rather be at the hospital that bans the worst and sends them to the ""compassionate"" hospital. 

2) Will any hospital pay for me to train in ICU/ER ? Current plan is to be there at least 2 years. Here the hospitals will train you for a specialty with expectation to work there for x amount of time. I assume hospitals in aus do something similar ? Would I be totally ineligible as a visitor, only eligible if I get PR? 

Thanks !"|melbourne|2019|True|0
"Gather 'round me, children, and let me tell you a tale, a tale of Grandma's Dumpling's.

The story begins at high noon on a chilly Melbourne Friday. Six hungry coworkers journeyed forth in search of food. For minutes we travelled the streets of Melbourne until we came before a restaurant named Grandma's Dumplings. ""This looks alright"", we thought, ""and cheap, too.""

We ventured into the small restaurant, soaked in the cosy atmosphere, and waited to be seated. And we kept waiting to be seated. We looked at each other, and pondered whether we should take a seat ourselves. After some five minutes of receiving no indication whatsoever that the staff was aware of our existence, we decided we had best seat ourselves.

And so we sat and waited. And we waited and sat. We sat and waited for a full ten minutes before one of the wait staff asked if we were ready to order. 

""Would I be able to see a menu, first?"" said I. The waitress disappeared, presumably to fetch a menu.

And so we sat and waited. And we waited and sat. We observed our surroundings more closely, noticing that the left and the right walls of the restaurant were completely different in style. We tried to read the menus stuck up on the wall, but the text was too small and too far away. All we could do was wait for a menu.

Time passed. The waitress came by with glasses -- not for us, but for the table in front. However, there was one spare glass so one of the friends I was seated with got that. Between the six of us, now there was one who could drink.

Before long, the waitress hurried back again with more glasses, and with menus. She then made a second run for menus so that there would be enough for all six of us.

The menu was incredible. Everything on it looked good -- and prices were great compared to those of many similar establishments. $10 lunch boxes with a free can of drink, noodle and rice dishes ranging from just under to just over $10. Even the more fancy items on the menu tended to sit under $20 -- incredibly good value considering what was on offer. The variety was great, the pictures informative.

It was on my second look through the menu that I began to notice the finer details. Several menu items had been added by hand -- pieces of paper with menus items either printed or handwritten on had been sticky-taped at various points throughout the menu. And, as all great menus, this one had lore.

In many restaurants such as this, the lore (the history, the backstory, the pitch) is written in English, or in a combination of both English and the native language of the cuisine in question. In this case, the lore was only in Chinese, so we had to rely on Google translate. However, if this translation is faithful, then the menu boats of a ""strange and peaceful source in the middle of the country"", of ""snacks, ancient and traditional"". ""Once the taste us often tempting,"" the menu says, ""and the taste is different, but it smells like it, it tastes aroma, it is the characteristic of tofu"". This is not the best restaurant lore I have seen (that honour goes to Dolan Uyghur Food Heaven), but still quite encouraging.

While we were peering through these marvellous menus, a man took a seat at the table formerly for four which we had split into a table for two. He spent a great deal of time trying to flag down a server to no avail. Eventually he gave up, and instead asked us for one of our menus. We were only too happy to oblige -- we knew how difficult the acquisition of menus in this place could be.

There were promotional signs around the restaurant advertising that a customer may receive a free drink with any lunch purchase. Being an experienced luncher, I knew that there would be some conditions on this. When I asked the waitress the response was very confused and confusing. I'm not sure who had more difficulty: we in understanding her, or her in understanding us. However, it was eventually clarified that cans of soft drink would be free. The status on plum juice remained ambiguous until the bill was printed.

It was roughly 12.40 when we finished ordering. The waitress left us to contemplate the choices we had made. The experience, up to that point, had already been remarkable. Surely the food could only add to this experience of wondrous bewilderment.

Ten minutes later the waitress reappeared at the table, letting us know that two of the requested dishes could not be made. This was no major obstacle -- changes were made painlessly -- however the fact that it took a full ten minutes between us ordering and us being told that we needed to change our order did not bode well. Those of us with free afternoons were already giddy with delight at this place. Those of us with pressing time commitments were starting to panic.

And so we sat and waited. We waited and sat. We saw customers who had arrived after us being served, eating their fill, paying and leaving. The man from the table next to ours managed to order, be served, absolutely demolish a plate of dumplings and leave before we had even received our drinks.

And then we received our drinks.

This is the point at which we began to realise that Grandma's Dumplings is no ordinary restaurant.

Five cans of coke were placed on the table, along with one bottle of plum juice (the menu had a picture of a can of plum juice, but alas it came in a bottle and for that reason was not free). Around me, my friends were opening their cans and imbibing the sweet fluid within. Not wanting to be late to the part, I opened mine.

It exploded with violent force, spraying me all over my shirt and pants. This can and this can alone had been shaken to near the point of eruption. Given the haphazard nature of everything else in the restaurant I can only speculate as to whether or not this was intentional. Did they set up their own sick game of Russian roulette? Or is their storage method such that somehow one can in six becomes shaken to oblivion? At the time I didn't care -- all I cared about was mopping myself off with the box of tissues provided in lieu of serviettes.

So there I was, sticky and hungry, sitting and waiting. Waiting and sitting. From my seat I had a good few of the counter and the kitchen window. I could see the frantic and confused staff trying to figure out what to do with the meals that kept appearing from the kitchen. Each of these plates underwent a journey, usually landing on at least two different tables before arriving at their final and intended destination. Some went back and forth from the kitchen a few times. There was one plate of food that spent some time sitting alone at a completely unoccupied table. The level of general confusion among the staff was unlike any I have experienced before. I was in awe.

Finally it came time for our food to arrive. It trickled in one dish at a time over the course of about an hour. No two members of our party of six were ever eating at the same time. The less fortunate of us had to see a wave of friends receive and finish their food before theirs even left the kitchen.

The pumpkin cakes arrived first, as is tradition. (I have eaten many a pumpkin cake in many a restaurant -- no matter what else is order, they always come first.) The pumpkin cakes themselves were very standard, however they were served with a bowl of sweet chilli sauce, presumably for dipping.

I was taken aback when I saw this. This is not a flavour combination I would have expected. But who am I to say I know better than the restaurant? Surely they knew their own cuisine better than I did!

They did not. Pumpkin cakes with sweet chilli sauce is an insane combination that makes no sense on any level. It was not good. Dear reader, if you ever venture forth yourself into Grandma's Dumplings, I can recommend the pumpkin cakes, but please do *not* dip them in the sweet chilli sauce. Not even once.

The dumplings were good. This is an unambiguous win for the restaurant. Grandma's Dumplings does good dumplings. Moving on.

Of the mains, the lunch boxes came first. These were a very plain affair but I will be honest, reader, it is hard for me to focus on the quality of the food. The restaurant itself was so distracting. The service was impossible to ignore -- not only the general confusion but also the slowness of it all. Recall that I mentioned the panic of those of us with time commitments that afternoon. One of our party had to teach a lab at 1.30 -- they wolfed down as much of their lunch box as they could in the 10 minutes afforded them before they had to dash off, leaving half of a lunch box and $20 note.

I, myself, ordered mapo tofu, which took just shy of 40 minutes to arrive and was about as plain, standard and uninteresting as mapo tofu can be. Not *bad*, by any stretch.

All in all, it was an experience I will never forget. 5/5 stars. Highly recommended."|melbourne|2019|True|0

Since I moved to Melbourne 3 years ago me and my partner had been going to the pizza Bar in Maribyrnong. We loved it so much we didn't even bother trying any other stores.

A couple of months ago they must have changed owners and the pizza was bad and made me and my partner a little sick. Never trying there again.

The last three times we have tried the Pizza workshop in Avondale heights. The pizza is good and the garlic bread is great but my partner gets the satay chicken pizza and even though the store has a section where you leave comments for the chef they have ignored the request for no pineapple on the pizza which annoys my partner.

"Hi, friends and fellow residents of Ohio. 

 (Edit: expect typos and grammatical errors, i have an exam or two to study for and do not have the time to make this perfect.)

(Edit2 : to those just joining in on this. This is a very panicky post and I apologize again for overstating the facts here by a lot. By no means is this situation as bad as Chernobyl as I mentioned once or twice here in the post. It however, will still have ecological consequences for us and the animals around east palestine for years to come. Please continue the healthy discussion and take time to look at u/shitposts_over_9000 comments. They are very informative)

So this topic is being beaten to death like a dead horse and honestly, there is a good reason. I am not very well-versed in the politics of the accident but I know some information that is all publicly accessed and anyone is free to correct me here. 

I’ll preface this by saying I’m just a worried adult who like many of us does not have a bright hope for the state of the environment of the world. I was writing a document late into the morning and decided to share my findings. I admit fault in not doing a lot of detailed review of the information provided by the EPA but did thoroughly research the chemicals involved and added in my perspective of things that will and can happen. The information provided by the EPA is a bit beyond my scope of understanding and its a lot of information. 

Why am I qualified to talk about it? I’m not in any way an expert at all and just wanted to find my own answers like all of you do. I have a background in Zoology so I guess it can mean something. It's like 50/50 speculation and fact here. It really depends on the information we are currently getting during this event.

This information is directly from the [EPA](https://response.epa.gov/site/doc_list.aspx?site_id=15933):
At approx. 8:55pm, Feb 3rd in East Palestine, Ohio. A Norfolk Southern train car derailed. 150 train cars total derailed 141 loaded cars, 9 empty cars, and 3 locomotives derailing. 20 of which carried hazardous materials, 14 of those 20 carrying vinyl chloride. Other materials found were butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate, and glycol monobutyl. As of Feb 10, 2023, these chemicals were known and are known to continually release into the surrounding air and water.


EPA found that Norfolk Southern violates Section 107 (a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). (This is essentially the big government act that holds corporations responsible for environmental whoopsie daisies). This particular section of CERCLA states that Norfolk Southern *may* be responsible for actions involving cleaning to protect public health, welfare, and/or the environment. They *may* also be required to cover costs of clean up.

**Extend at which Norfolk Southern Bungus'd up**
All information currently being stated is directly from an [EPA report.](https://response.epa.gov/sites/15933/files/FINAL%20East%20Palestine%20Train%20Derailment%20Air%20Monitoring%20FAQ%202.9.23.pdf)

- Materials released have been found in samples from Sulfur Run, Leslie Run, Bull Creek, North Folk Little Beaver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and the **OHIO RIVER**

-  Materials have been found entering storm drains

- Materials that were burned were:
* Vinyl Chloride
* Ethylene glycol monobutyl
* Ethyhexyl acrylate
* Isobutylene
* Butyl acrylate

- Some contaminated ground/soil that has had material burned off on top of it has been covered up without proper disposal prior to the reconstruction of the rail.

Here is a list of [76 different chemical compounds.] (https://response.epa.gov/sites/15933/files/ASPECT%20Summary%20%20Report%20--%20East%20Palestine%20Derailment%20Rev1.pdf) can be found in the air on February 3rd. Some are harmless and some are bad. Either way 76 chemcials in the air. The chemicals they are currently monitoring in the air as of Feb 10th are [here.] (https://response.epa.gov/sites/15933/files/Roving%20Air%20Monitoring%20Results%20Summary%20Table_Public_20230210.pdf)

Here are *some* of the chemicals of concern and why there are no good for life. The list of chemical comounds is slighlty outdated as there are still finding more information on what spilled out the train cars. The main thing that I have not covered is that they found cars containing [ethylene glycol and petrolum oil](https://response.epa.gov/sites/15933/files/TRAIN%2032N%20-%20EAST%20PALESTINE%20-%20derail%20list%20Norfolk%20Southern%20document.pdf) as of Feburary 12th. 

I get a bit informal here because this is a lot of information for someone to report seriously for a college student. Sorry.

**Vinyl Chloride (C2H3Cl)** 
When burns can break down into hydrogen chloride (HCl), phosgene, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide. Its heavily carcinogenic and is commonly used for PVC, it is also a byproduct of tobacco smoke. It can cause rare and common forms of liver cancer, lymphomaa, brain, lung, and leukemia. 

**Phosgene (COCl2)**
Toxic, colorless gas. Slowly degrades in air, but degrades quicker in soil or water. Used as a  chemical weapon in WW1.
 >“Phosgene is extremely poisonous and was used as a chemical weapon during World War I, where it was responsible for 85,000 deaths. It is a highly potent pulmonary irritant and quickly filled enemy trenches due to it being a heavy gas.” 

Thanks wikipedia.

Literally deemed too dangerous to transport in bulk quantities due to its toxicity. Oh and I should mention it creates MORE hydrogen chloride on contact with water.

**Hydrogen Chloride (HCl)**
A colorless gas. Forms hydrochloric acid upon contact with water. Smells bad and can irritate respiratory systems.


**Hydrochloric Acid (HCl also lol)**
This is that fun acid that everyone talks about and is formed from HCl when its interacting with water. Its the aqueous verson of HCl and is a component of stomach acid. Its used it basic chemistry due to its versatility as an acid. In the environment however, it will go do fun things like readily bind to water in cloud, rain, and fog. Its a component of acid rain and can also contribute to smog.

This stuff can degrade minerals like limestone and silicates. This pertains to include clay, igneous rocks, and limestone bridges, art works, and buildings. HCl does a bunch of things to the environment but it mainly just melts everything from water, to living tissue, to I guess buildings and like made with limestone. (which I just read is super common) 



**n-Butyl Acrylate (C7H12O2)**
Colorless liquid used in paint, sealants, coatings, adhesives, fuel??, textiles, plastics, and caulk. Not particularly toxic. Its flammable and can irritate lungs, skin, and eyes. Also apparently pretty explosive and reacts with air.  (this is one cool ass chemicalif not for being in the air and water) Its pretty toxic to aquatic microorganisms but that assumes it doesn’t react with the ambient air first lol. 

**Ethylene Glycol Monobutyl Ether Acetate (C8H16O3)**
It is a solvent thats flammable, can cause headaches, nausea, and irritation of the eyes and skin. Its used in spray lacquers, enamel, varnish, latex paint, liquid soaps, cosmetics, industrial and household cleaners, and epoxy resins. Can be a reproductive toxin, kidney toxin, and brain toxin. Kills aquatic organisms pretty good.

**2-Ethylhexyl Acrylate (C11H20O2)**
FUN one. It smells nice apparently all sources says “pleasent”. idk what that means pleasant like food or flowers here man. Used again, for plastics, adhesives, latex, paints, textiles, leather finishes and the like. Its a carcinogen and can cause coughing, irritation of the eys, throat, and skin. Its a Central Nervous system toxin. Kills aquatic organisms pretty good too.

**Why is this bad?**
Well for one I personally think this is an ecological disaster almost as bad as Chernobyl. (EDIT 2: This assumption about Chernobyl is absurd and I apologize for the dumb comment.) I don't want to fear-monger here but I am rightfully afraid. You might be thinking I'm overreacting here but please hear me out. (Don't hate me mods)Do you remember me mentioning above some chemicals have been found in our waterways? There are some interesting statistics that I found regarding Ohio's usage of water from the Ohio River Basin. More than [5 million people](http://www.orsanco.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/State_of_the_River_April_2017_WEB.pdf) get their drinking water from the Ohio River. A likely outdated number as well because this article was from 2017. About [35% of the land](https://wqt.epri.com/agricultural-engagement.html) touching the Ohio River Basin is dedicated to agriculture. Things like livestock, fruit, dairy, and crops. 

This is really just the Ohio River Basin too. There is a chance acid rain could form and head northward toward the Great Lakes. The Ohio River connects to the Mississippi and goes out into the Gulf of Mexico. People who live close to East Palestine are [posting](https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/east-palestine-train-derailment/officials-speak-on-dead-fish-following-train-derailment/) [things](https://mobile.twitter.com/GoodVibePolitik/status/1624170480482541588) [like](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/video/dead-fish-found-in-leslie-run-near-east-palestine-train-derailment/) [this](https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/east-palestine-train-derailment/north-lima-woman-finds-chickens-dead-tuesday-questions-chemical-release-from-train/). Media outlets are covering this but sparsely from what I've seen. Detailing terrible amounts of environmental loss. So whatever you are being told about it being safe. That is clearly a lie. Most of the concern of air quality is mainly burned particles from what I can see from the EPA reports. But I could be wrong about that.

I want to close off by saying I could be wrong and I would love to be wrong. I am not a scientist or an approved college researcher and all of this information is ongoing. Information changes and I am completely okay being wrong here. We could be fine but its better to worry about this than not. This is an open discussion for me. Please feel free to be a critic as I am looking for more answers (and the right ones) just like all of you."|Ohio|2023|True|0
"Okay I know Ohio changed local tax laws because of the covid work from home but this is giving me a headache. they made employers withhold for the physical work location, so I had 4 different local tax withholding w2s.

So I worked for the same employer all year. full remotely for the first 5 months and hybrid the last 7.

I lived in one city for the first 7 months and another the last 5.

They took out tax for each place I worked. So they withheld taxes for the time worked at residenceA, time worked at residence B, and time worked at employment city and then the .5 difference for time worked onsite while living at residence B because the tax rate is higher. So I was sent 3 pages of W2s.

how tf do I square this when filing with my two residences to prove I already paid the sufficient credit?

"I know this is crazy /s, don’t have these large gatherings. COVID numbers are crazy high! And guess what?? Masks work!! We have had 4 positive employees at work in the last 2 months Guess what? All were linked to family. None got it from work. Why? Masks, sanitizing, and social distancing. 

NO method is fool proof, yes you can still get it when all parties are wearing a mask but your odds are ALOT lower! 

This isn’t rocket science, most cases are being contact traced to family gatherings, bars, and restaurants. Why?? Because of prolong exposure without masks and without adequate distancing. 

You have to be cautious but this virus does not have legs and cannot get up and travel to your neighbors house. Mask wearing, limiting time around people, and always keeping atleast 6 feet are PROVEN to dramatically reduce spread. 

I’ve seen it at my own work place. Each person from my work who had it did not spread it to anyone else at work. Of course we may have gotten lucky but I believe masks and social distancing, as well as quick quarantine the moment symptoms arose made all the difference

EDIT: From one of my nurse friends working on the covid floor, all patients are currently 50+ and youngest she’s seen was 40. No this doesn’t mean if you’re under 40 you’re in the clear and certainly doesn’t negate your responsibility to those over 50. This virus is scary to many in their 20s and down right terrifying to many over 50! Be a good human, think of others, your night out at the bar can wait if it means possibly helping out a higher risk person! If we are lucky we will be over 50 one day and I’m damn sure we wouldn’t want some 20 something spreading the next plague to us because they’re not worried about it. 

Also it seems many over 50 are the least concerned about it. Just crazy to me. I have told my mom we are NOT going to thanksgiving this year. She said there’s nothing to worry about you’re buying into the panic.

I mean, if you’re within 200 miles of a border, which equates to 2/3 of the country, the government can have check points and stop your car to see if there’s anyone undocumented in your car. About a decade ago, SCOTUS ruled that it was constitutional for an innocent person to be strip searched at the jail as part of getting arrested in a ticket mix up where the cop was looking at outdated data and mistakenly thought the guy had a warrant out for his arrest. And who can forget TSA who says they can naked body scan you and/or grab your genitals if you want to fly. There are way bigger liberty issues than wearing a mask to curb the spread. And scientists change as new facts and data comes out. Do you read a science book and say “huh I wonder what they thought 6 months before they figured this out? Must all be equally bad information I guess if they revised anything.” Aren’t you more worried about the government and foreign countries using data from fb and other places we store our info for nefarious purposes? I get the distrust of authority in general but man, there are way bigger fish to fry and I hear crickets outside of the mask stuff. 

Masks don’t hurt anyone, and it’s a fact it slows the spread. Doctors, experts and healthcare workers are begging us to wear them, so isn’t it possible the anti-mask movement is probably propaganda meant to divide us and keep the virus alive and well? If you wanted to cripple and divide a country so it fights itself from within, all while avoiding any blame, because you wanted to destabilize the US, what better way than what’s happening right now? People don’t even share the same facts. The way we are being systematically divided and the deaths were experiencing is more harmful than a bomb drop, especially because most people don’t even realize we’re under attack, and they’re defending the groups trying to divide us. The Cold War never ended, and we’re seeing the long game play out. The only way authoritarian countries can rise is not by doing better on their own, but by lowering their enemies to their already low level. 

Please wear a mask everyone, or at least be consistent with your fear and outrage.

Dear Nebraskans,

I am a critical care physician taking care of COVID-19 patients in Omaha, NE.  I have been tracking the COVID situation in Nebraska very closely since February.  This letter explains our current situation and what we can do to improve it.

**Short version:  The COVID-19 outbreak in our state is extremely severe, and the only way we can improve this is for everyone to get very serious about social distancing.**

The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Nebraska is gravely concerning.  The 7-day rolling averages are very bad and getting worse.  Nebraska has 641 new cases per million per day.  Douglas County has 548 new cases per million per day.  These are among the worst rates of new cases in the United States.  Every week, our county and our state set new records for new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.  All parts of the state, and indeed the entire region, are in a similar situation.  

A large rise in case counts is always followed a few weeks later by a large rise in deaths caused by COVID.  Nebraska is starting to experience this reality, and the trends indicate that the situation will get much worse in the weeks to come.  In September and early October, the number of deaths in Nebraska was fairly steady at about 25 per week.  Two weeks ago this spiked to 44.  Last week Nebraska had 55 deaths.  This upward trend will continue.

Nebraska has 698 COVID-positive people in the hospital – exactly one month ago we had 271 (a record at that time).  The Omaha Metro has 303 COVID-positive inpatients – exactly one month ago we had 125. These numbers rise every day.  Hospitals in Omaha and throughout Nebraska can and will fill up without a drastic change in the trends.  Operating hospitals above normal capacity impacts the care of all conditions, not just COVID-19.  When ICUs are full, there are no beds for the next victim of an asthma attack, stroke or heart attack.  And when these patients are stuck in crowded emergency departments, the ability to deliver optimal care is hampered.

Many people have noted the low case fatality rate in Nebraska.  One of the main reasons for this low case fatality rate is the fact that while our hospitals have been under strain, they have never been overwhelmed.  If Nebraska’s hospitals become overwhelmed, the case fatality rate will go up swiftly.  We know this from analyzing the fatality rates in other parts of the United States and the world.  

While we have made progress in understanding how to best treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19, this progress is only applicable in the event that we maintain adequate capacity to care for sick patients.  In response to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, hospital leaders are implementing plans to increase capacity throughout the state.  These plans are necessary, but having physical space for patients does not solve the problem.  Temporary traveling healthcare workers will help to provide care in these additional spaces, but these workers are not unlimited in number.  Hospitals all over the United States are hiring them to address the same conundrum.

You may have read that hospitals in Nebraska have ample capacity to handle a large increase in new cases.  I disagree with this statement.  Here is how you can find out for yourself.  Ask a physician, a nurse, and/or a respiratory therapist who works in one of the largest hospitals in your area, “How are you doing in terms of census and capacity?  Do you think your hospital can handle a large increase in COVID admissions?”  I know how they will answer because I ask colleagues these questions regularly.

**The best way to limit the devastating effects of this COVID-19 surge is to interrupt the transmission of the virus.  Reducing the number of new cases will require a dramatic change in behavior.**  We have learned from other nations how to keep transmission rates low.  In order to prevent many unnecessary deaths, we need to dramatically change the way we are conducting our lives.  The actions are very simple.  We must avoid crowded places, closed spaces (especially with poor ventilation), and close contact with non-household members.  We must avoid the “Three C’s” all of the time.  We must wear our masks, watch our distance, and wash/sanitize our hands.  We must do the “Three W’s” all of the time outside of our own homes.  We need to stop gathering.

I will define “gathering” as:  people spending time together, indoors, with people from outside their own household, for non-essential activities.  When people gather, they (1) put themselves at risk for contracting the virus, and (2) risk passing the virus to others.  Put bluntly, when people gather they contribute to the outbreak.

Here are some examples of gatherings that are contributing to the spread of the virus:

\-	Multiple (more than one) families getting together indoors for meals or parties

\-	Dining inside of a restaurant, especially if it is crowded

\-	Spending time inside a bar, especially if it is crowded

\-	Indoor group sports.  Example:  playing basketball indoors with non-household members is a perfect mechanism for spreading the virus.

\-	Working out at a gym, especially if crowded

\-	Attending events with non-household members.  Example:  attending a crowded wedding reception, particularly indoors and without masks, is a perfect way to contract and transmit the virus.

While avoiding some of these gatherings might sound drastic, these sacrifices are mild compared with the suffering and deaths our state will experience without a change in behaviors.  Many people say that they have a “bubble” which consists of multiple families whom they trust because of their excellent social distancing.  Gathering with multiple people from outside your own household is the opposite of social distancing.  Such gatherings are contributing to the increased cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

If you and your family have eased up on your social distancing, as most people have, now is the time to revert back to how you did it in April.  Every time you forego a group gathering, know that you are saving a Nebraskan’s life.  Yes, it is that dire.

Please keep in mind that asymptomatic spread is extremely common.  This means that ANY person, even without any signs of illness, can transmit the disease to you and your family members.  This is why we must maintain distance between ourselves and non-household members all of the time.

Children get infected and transmit the virus – there is undeniable scientific evidence for this now.  Thankfully, few children get very sick.  Still, when asymptomatic children are not socially distanced, they spread the virus to other children, who eventually transmit the virus to vulnerable people (of all ages).  Those vulnerable people are at the highest risk for severe disease or death.

Herd immunity without a vaccine is not possible.  If the United States tries to pursue herd immunity without a vaccine, millions of Americans will die from COVID.  This is not acceptable.

Masks help to prevent spread, but they are not magical.  Being outdoors reduces risk, but this is not magical either.  Yes, wear a mask.  Yes, do things outdoors instead of indoors.  Still, the best way to eliminate risk is to not be near other people for non-essential activities.

People in our communities have a choice right now.  We can continue on the current trajectory, which will be catastrophic, or we can choose to engage in real social distancing and save hundreds if not thousands of Nebraskans’ lives.  The sooner we get this outbreak under control, the sooner we can get back to a more normal way of life.

Please see the data presented below.

Stay safe,

I’m ranting. I caught a nasty bug from my wife when she was sick. Sore throat, congestion, runny nose, fever, and chills. She went to an Ochsner Urgent Care and was seen by a NP.  She was coughing a lot and getting yellow/green phlegm when coughing. NP diagnosed her with an upper respiratory virus and gave her steroids and an OTC cough medicine. She waited a few days, but wasn’t getting any better. She finally got antibiotics and the colored phlegm went away and she was getting over it. I ended up catching it from her and had similar symptoms. I went to the urgent care and they diagnosed me with an upper respiratory virus. I was having similar colored phlegm when I coughed. The NP said that was no big deal. Tested negative for COVID and the Flu. Still, diagnosed as a respiratory virus and was given steroids and Tesslon pearls.  Said antibiotics were not necessary. After a day of worsening of my symptoms including a bad sore throat, I was able to get antibiotics. Began feeling better. But now I am coughing my head off with nothing coming out.  It just seems like a canned response to tell people you have a virus and you don’t need anything such as antibiotics despite colored phlegm usually meaning there is an infection present. Anyway, why the hell is it so taboo to give cough syrup with dextramorphan , guaifenesin, and codeine? I don’t have a history of taking anything controlled. Instead, hear is some crappy OTC cough medicine that isn’t doing anything.|NewOrleans|2023|True|1

Maybe an odd request: I have a good friend who is very sick. We had planned a trip to Disneyland to celebrate some good medical news. It would have been this weekend that we went but she is unable to due to a new development. It’s a small thing but I know it’s heartbreaking to her. 

If there is anyone that is going to be visiting Anaheim or that has some great photos of their recent time at Disneyland I would be so appreciative to be able to share those with my friend.

Duhamel had to be hospitalized after doctors found low oxygen blood count on a pulse oximeter. She complained of severe headaches and nausea after attending the Governor's budget address.

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [300,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)). Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* **Update:** Viewer discretion is advised: [A heartbreaking look](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-everyone-dies-alone-heartbreak-at-italian-hospital-on-brink-of-collapse-11961130) into the frontlines of an Italian hospital. Do not underestimate this virus.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. Update: [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). Update: [Speed trumps perfection](https://twitter.com/ConallMcD/status/1238865202868883461).

* If you're experiencing distress, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

* [Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/) with regards to this section.

#**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:**

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking](https://twitter.com/kr3at/status/1240296333354950658?s=19)/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx)). Quitting now [can save your life](https://coronawiki.org/page/covid-19-the-role-of-smoking-cessation-during-respiratory-virus-epidemics).

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

* **UPDATE:** March 18th: ""99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says"" ( [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkq6vz/99_of_those_who_died_from_virus_had_other_illness/) )

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds)).

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w). March 17th update: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" (Source [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)). March 20th update: Latest genome analysis seems to suggest two viruses may have combined ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-origins-genome-analysis-covid19-data-science-bats-pangolins/))

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that).

"I just got back from the Winco on Milkwaukee and while I was there two guys were going around the store harassing the customers wearing masks, doing things like flipping them off or getting up closely behind them and then just laughing while they followed them. I had them try this with me a couple times, and then get into the checkout line behind me. Fortunately, they didn't try anything in front of the cashiers, and I let them leave before and waited inside for a bit as I didn't trust they weren't going to pull more harassment out in the parking lot.  


I'm posting this to ask people to please be careful this week. I think there's going to be big uptick in behavior like this while the drama around the election unfolds. Hopefully, most of it is as relatively harmless as what I saw tonight, but I don't trust that there won't be an increase in violent interactions as well. **Don't let people drag you into fights**, and just be mindful that a lot of people are going to be on edge with how intense everything has gotten.  


Stay safe.

EDIT: I know everyone is having fun venting because we’re all sick of seeing or hearing about this sort of stupidity, and that the venting is largely hyperbole, but I just wanted to say again: Don’t let people drag you into fights. There are a lot of trolls that go around looking for reactions from people, and feeding them said reactions often doesn’t prevent them from future trolling—with a number of those trolls straight up using video footage of the reactions they get to generate even more attention online. There’s also the fact that you never know how far someone is willing to take things—maybe they’ll cave or maybe they’re one of the Idahoans posters in here keep mentioning that carry a concealed gun. Just be careful while you’re out, and if you run into people like this don’t let them drag you down to their level."|Boise|2020|True|0
"Hey!

I live in the Denver metro area (Aurora) and like the title says, I am looking to start a band. I'm 35, and I used to play in a lot of bands when I was younger, mainly in the New England area scene - Street punk, Oi!, Pogo sort of stuff.

Anyway, I am looking to start something in the vein of early 00's Street Punk, but with flexibility to get weird and incorporate other genres into it. I am thinking influences of my song writing style at the moment are bands like Unwanted Noise, Chaotic Alliance, early Global Threat, early Unseen, Copyright Chaos, Krum Bums, The Virus, as well as UK82 and Oi!, and a dash of some D-beat/Crust bands like Dystopia, Aus Rotten, Disfear, etc, and some Japanese bands like Pogo Machine, and The Bollocks.

Anyway, I am looking to play rhythm guitar/lead vocals. I would say that my vocal style sounds similar to Chaotic Alliance and Unwanted Noise. My lyrical writing is political (leftist, anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, An-Com, intersectional) as well as introspective on my experiences of being disabled, VERY working class focused, and raw as fuck. I am hoping to record and get shows going pretty quickly if possible.

I personally don't have direct access to a decent practice space, but am open to traveling to meet if one is available.

If you are interested in getting together and jamming and see if we vibe, please feel free to DM me!

"First and foremost, I am an independent, but this is not a post with my intent to go over the nuances of my political views and ideologies but to focus on the recent and ongoing actions of the state legislature that go beyond party and are an affront to a democratic republic. There has been ongoing discussion, that seems to have heated up in recent days, regarding the impeachment of a recently elected state supreme court justice. The legislature has a mechanism and numbers to at least attempt this action. The fact that they are even entertaining this should be offensive to all everybody.

To attempt to impeach a statewide elected official that won by roughly an 11 point margin because she was supported by donors and made statements on relevant issues in her election cycle spits in the face of what this state and nation have stood for since inception.

Let me break that down:
11-point margin - look at Wisconsin's statewide elections in the past decade, this is about as much of a mandate from the populous as a statewide candidate seems to ever get.

Supported by donors - this is a key point of the Republican's argument in why her not recusing could be problematic. Find me a supreme court race in Wisconsin that hasn't had that in the past 10 years. I am all for getting money out of politics but this just isn't something they had a problem with when they had full control of state government. Though I agree that large money donors and citizens united is problematic for swaying politicians, but let's then go after the cause (something I don't hear them doing) rather than the symptom that supreme court justices needed mega donors to compete in state races (money poured into this state on both sides of the aisle in race).

Made statements on issues - this is not illegal and from everything I've seen she did not give any indication on how she would rule in any specific way. I can feel things are rigged and still not feel they are unconstitutional. I would think judges would be as rational if not more given the role we give them in our government. There is plenty of precedent for judges having opinions out in the open that have not barred them from their positions (wrote a paper in college, worked on x case, ruled this way in the past, etc.). Currently sitting conservative justices fit that bill as well, but you heard not a peep from the state legislature, who are now trying to be the idealists.

Checks and balances are what makes all of this work. At this point statewide races are the only way to be a check on one party rule in this state and the Republicans in the legislature are trying to prevent that. Don't let them convince you they're trying to defend the constitution of this state or this country as their moves to reduce the governors powers when they lost that seat fall in this same pattern of behavior. No issue until it wasn't theirs anymore.

Don't even get me started on the fact that they're even able to do this because they used a sophisticated system to choose their voters which just feels icky for a democratic republic too. Constitutional? Up for debate and will be going through the courts yet again, but definitely not a good look either.

Obligatory Republicans aren't all fascists but this doesn't help some of their cases and Democrats are not perfect either, but I'll wait to focus on them until I see them pull something of this magnitude and given the composition of the state and it's current maps, that's not really a realistic view of something that could happen in any near term.

I've also been told they won't actually go through with it, it's just a bargaining ploy, one, I take people at their word and then watch their actions, sue me, and two, this then feels like mafia tactics. It's like having a loaded (enough votes) firearm (impeachment) pointing it at someone and saying, oh come on, they're not actually gonna shoot you. Ok, but still, why are you threatening it?

On this subreddit there seems to be a lot of animosity over this, but some people I talk to day to day don't seem as offended by these actions, am I going crazy?"|wisconsin|2023|True|0

"All public health officials have long advised that people who are sick should wear a mask to limit infecting others.

More recently evidence has accumulated that people can spread Cornavirus even before they know they are sick. The Philadelphia health department now declares this as fact: https://twitter.com/PHLPublicHealth/status/1245112143160229889

Evidence has also been surfaced that any face and nose covering -- even a homemade mask made from a t-shirt -- is better than nothing. Evidence has also surfaced that masks also probably give some protection to the person wearing them. Furthermore, to help overcome shortages, masks can be reused by washing cloth masks in the laundry or by baking a surgical mask in the oven at 160 degrees for 30 minutes. (sources [1](https://medium.com/better-humans/whats-the-evidence-on-face-masks-5f3c27a18cc), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/), [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01428.x), [4](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/health/us-coronavirus-face-masks.html), [5](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1242894378441506816.html) )

So...given all this new knowledge isn't it obvious that we need everyone to be wearing face coverings when they are enclosed with other people, such on SEPTA or in grocery stores?

It seems crazy to me that we are bearing this tremendous burden of shutting down our city and not seeing friends and family -- and then I go to the super market and dozens of people are mixing in close proximity with no protection. Even if masks aren't 100% effective, if everyone is wearing a mask and it reduces spread in common areas by 75%, that is huge for getting the overall epidemic under control.

In order to get the outbreak under control and start opening up the city again, we need to get R0, the reproductive number for this virus, below 1. Without social distancing, R0 seems to be 3 or 4. If we undergo all the disruption of the shut down, but we end up only reducing R0 to something like 1.3, then despite the shut down the epidemic will still be getting worse and worse every day and there won't be a peak at all until most of us have been infected. But if we can get R0 all the way below 1, we can get it bottled up in a month or two. Thus, it is imperative we do every possible to make sure we err on the side of getting R0 as low as we humanly can.

Wouldn't we feel really, really stupid if a month from now we find the shut-down has only reduced R0 to 1.3 and there are actually more cases than ever -- but that if we had just required everyone to wear a mask at the super market the shutdown could have been almost over?

Let's not be that stupid. Mayor Kenney, Dr Farley, CEO's of relevant companies and agencies, /u/phlpublichealth, please require masks in grocery stores and on SEPTA!

ADDENDUM since I think some people are objecting to the idea of requiring masks when we don't actually have masks for everyone:

I do not think that starting tomorrow if someone shows up at the grocery store for their weekly shopping trip without a mask, and without any ability to obtain one they should be sent home and be SOL.

I'd suggest phasing it in.

Starting Immediately, the government should issue the strongest recommendation that everyone should be wearing masks in public indoor places. The government should issue guidance on how to sanitize masks for reuse, and how to make a mask from t-shirts and paper towels. Some businesses are actually banning their clerks from wearing masks. This should be reversed, it should be illegal to prevent a store clerk from wearing a mask to work.

Then the government should work with business and the population to increase mask supply -- whether sourcing from suppliers, making easy temporary masks from paper towels, or getting the citizens of this city to volunteer for sewing cloth masks, as they are doing in Czechoslovakia.

Once we have sourced enough masks that super markets can hand out at least some form of temporary mask to anybody who doesn't have one, then it can actually be made mandatory."|Philadelphia|2020|True|0

"This article contains the 30-second ad by Gov. Mike DeWine and his wife Fran opposing Issue 1.  The article promotes the arguments of the anti-Issue 1 ""Protect Women Ohio,"" without any challenge to the group's positions.

[https://theohiostar.com/news/governor-mike-dewine-and-first-lady-fran-dewine-urge-ohioans-to-vote-no-on-issue-1-this-election/khousler/2023/10/12/](https://theohiostar.com/news/governor-mike-dewine-and-first-lady-fran-dewine-urge-ohioans-to-vote-no-on-issue-1-this-election/khousler/2023/10/12/)

The article doesn't mention that Gov. DeWine signed the effectively six week ""heartbeat bill"" that would effectively ban most abortions in Ohio, pending an ongoing court case, unless a majority of voters vote ""yes"" for Issue 1 in November.

[https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/11/ohio-gov-mike-dewine-signs-heartbeat-abortion-bill/3437541002/](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/11/ohio-gov-mike-dewine-signs-heartbeat-abortion-bill/3437541002/)

In the ad, DeWine claims that he and his wife ""carefully studied"" Issue 1, but their ad only discusses abortion and never mentions that Issue 1 guarantees the right of Ohioans to make ALL reproductive rights with limited exceptions.

DeWine says Issue 1 ""just is not right for Ohio,"" not surprising as he clearly believes an almost total ban on abortions is what is right for Ohio.  By opposing Issue 1 with no qualifications, DeWine and his wife also clearly believe that the right for Ohioans to make their own reproduction decisions, including contraception decisions, also is ""not right for Ohio.""

DeWine and his wife apparently object to all abortions in the ad, with Fran DeWine claiming that Issue 1 would allow an abortion at ""any time during a pregnancy.""  The amendment actually would allow the state to outlaw abortions after fetal viability, but only if the mother's treating physician doesn't deem the abortion necessary to protect the mother's life or health.

The following article discusses abortions after fetal viability, typically 23 to 24 weeks, and describes how most abortions later in a pregnancy are due to health concerns. 

<<  According to data released in September by the Ohio Department of  Health, nearly 90% of abortions in 2022 occurred in the first trimester  of pregnancy, or under 13 weeks. There were 107 abortions performed at  21 weeks or later, accounting for 0.6% of all abortions in the state.

Data on the reasons people get abortions later in pregnancy is scant, but Kimport has studied it. Her [qualitative assessment of 28 women’s experiences](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1363/psrh.12190)  undergoing abortions after 24 weeks found two “pathways” to an abortion  later in pregnancy: Barriers prevented women from accessing abortions  earlier, and new information, particularly about the health of the  fetus, led them to terminate the pregnancy. 

Certain information about the health of a fetus cannot be known until  later in pregnancy, Kimport said. For most of the women she interviewed  who terminated their pregnancy due to a severe fetal abnormality,  regular scans and tests showed no issues until after 20 weeks gestation,  with some not showing serious health issues until 24 weeks or later.

A crucial amount of brain development occurs in the final weeks of  pregnancy, as does the development of other organs. Several  developmental disorders are not detectable until later in pregnancy.  There are also things that can happen to a pregnant person that impact  fetal health, including becoming infected with the Zika virus or other  diseases and undergoing cancer treatment.>>

[https://www.nbc4i.com/news/your-local-election-hq/ohio-issue-1-fact-check-why-and-how-people-get-abortions-later-in-pregnancy/](https://www.nbc4i.com/news/your-local-election-hq/ohio-issue-1-fact-check-why-and-how-people-get-abortions-later-in-pregnancy/)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal\_viability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability)

The DeWines claim to be concerned about parental rights regarding a minor's decision to have an abortion.  Clearly, they are not concerned about parental rights to obtain an abortion for their pregnant minor as they oppose almost all abortions, as evidenced by the heartbeat bill that Gov. DeWine signed into law.

The DeWines didn't discuss Issue 1's protection of contraception rights, not surprising given Ohio Republicans' general unwillingness to guarantee contraception rights, including to Plan B ""morning-after"" pills, now available over-the-counter.

I'm in a difficult spot. I'm an Ohio native, did a BA and MA in English there, then came out to California to do a PhD. I was a promising scholar and was on track for a professorship...

...until a fucking virus attacked my brain and wrecked my life. I'm still finishing up the dissertation, but my academic career is over. I was effectively bedridden during a lot of my time in the program and didn't have the chance to do all the bullshit you have to do to be competitive in the increasingly nasty academic job market.

I'm still recovering from what the virus did to me, but I'm confident I could now work a part-time or even low-impact full-time job while finishing up the dissertation. It doesn't have to be the best paying; I'm moving back next week to live with my mother while I finish up. I just want some stability for the first time since I got this dumb illness.

Spouse and I have been fighting the same respiratory illness for almost 2 months now. Feels like a downgraded version of Covid but man I can’t stop coughing. And just a dry cough, nothing really comes out.

I’m less affected when I’m out of the house which has me wondering if it’s something in our apt. Ordered an air purifier and am looking into doing some tests of air quality if I can.

Can’t think of much we’ve changed or disturbed in our place that would do this. And it’s been recently renovated 2 years ago. An apartment complex for reference.

Had some crackheads move in next door, but not sure if them smoking can actually make it into my apartment (shared walls) or if I’m trying to find that as an excuse as to why I feel like this.

"Hey everyone, I just had to vent about something that’s been really bothering me. The way public holidays are handled differently across states is driving me nuts!

I work for a company that operates in multiple states, and when one state has a holiday while another doesn’t, it creates total chaos. Projects get delayed, and coordinating with teammates becomes a headache. It’s so hard to stay productive when some of us are off while others are grinding away.

This misalignment isn’t just a pain as an employee... surely this hurts businesses too? When one state is closed and another is open, companies miss out on sales and opportunities, delays cost so much $ in lost productivity and mismatched schedules. Depending on where the holiday falls, it can push things back in other states anywhere from 2-5 days.

This gripe comes as we are navigating ANOTHER misaligned public holiday where it just seems pointless to even be in the office. Half the people I need to talk to, aren't in the office. In 2 weeks time, the reverse will be true, when QLD is off and nobody else is. My phone will still be pinging with work because everyone else is at work. Sure, there's ""Right to Disconnect"", this isn't a reality of keeping many businesses afloat especially SME.

This work also doesn't just go nowhere, it still needs to be done.

At the end of the day, I really think this lack of alignment is holding us back. Aligning public holidays would reduce confusion, save time, and create a more productive environment for everyone.

I really just needed to vent this out. I could be totally out of line and out of my depth with this frustration, maybe it makes sense to someone out there who rules these things as something good for the state or country, but an interconnected nation it's so frustrating to have to continuously navigate these random misaligned holidays for the SAME THING.

"Hi Brisbane

I've sold a few dead cars to wreckers in the past, and each time it’s been a similar headache. 

It feels like they’ll agree to anything over the phone just to get the car, but when they show up, the high-pressure tactics start, and they aggressively try to knock down the price.

The last time I went through this, I called to discuss the car’s condition (330,000 km, lots of pending repairs, bad clutch), and we verbally agreed on $500. But when the tow truck arrived, the driver took one look at the faded paint on the bonnet and said, ""Oh, it’s pretty bad, I can only offer you $50."" He hadn’t even walked around the car yet—just a glance. It felt like he was reading off a script.

After 20 minutes of negotiating on the footpath, we eventually settled on $450. At one point, the driver called his boss, handed me the phone, and I had to haggle with the boss too (unprovoked, not a 'i want to speak to your manager' thing).

Luckily, I had a friend who had recently scrapped a car of the same model and year for $450, so I had set out asking for $500 but willing to land on $450. Without that, with the persistent aggressive negotiating, I would have ended up taking less.

Now, I have another car on its way out—a Mitsubishi Mirage with a dying transmission that’s not worth repairing. I’m looking to sell it as scrap but unsure what it’s worth (probably less than the $450 for the last car, since this one’s smaller).

Can anyone recommend a wrecker in Brisbane that won’t be such a hassle to deal with?

"I'm tired of the scaremongering and emotional reasoning, and most of you probably are too. It's been a long and difficult year, so it's tiring to see negativity everywhere when we have more reason now than ever before to believe we're nearly at the end. So I decided to put a few sources together explaining why I'm optimistic in as factual a way as possible.

**Is herd immunity even possible?** In short, the data still indicates the answer is **yes**. I'm sure most of us have read yesterday's NYT article that paints a gloomy picture of never reaching herd immunity.^(1) It's worth noting that the article contains very little actual data-oriented scientific analysis, instead being a small collection of expert opinions and nebulous extrapolations of current vaccination rates. While it may be the opinion of a small group of experts, there is also substantial reason to believe it is wrong. First, real-world data from Israel suggests that somewhere between 60-70% vaccination is sufficient to suppress cases to a trickle (they're now in double-digits-per-day territory, from a high of nearly 10000/day).^(2) Second, I don't believe you can stake a case for herd immunity being impossible entirely on vaccine hesitancy. Remember, immunity comes from both vaccination *and* infection. Even though it's considered distasteful to note this, the fact still remains that most studies suggest that ""natural immunity"" is quite robust,^(3) which is why reinfections remain rare.^(4) The big question is how much overlap is there between vaccinated and infected individuals? That's an almost impossible question to definitively answer, but it's worth noting that the most vaccine-hestitant are typically the same people who disregard precautions and are at a higher risk for infection. Infections among them still count toward herd immunity (although for the sake of their safety, of course it's better that they instead get vaccinated). So while we may not see a rapid drop to zero cases, it's quite likely we will see cases precipitously drop to a manageable level as the virus gradually burns out in its smaller pockets.

**What about variants?** I'm going to come out and say it directly: the idea that we're on the verge of a ""variant apocalypse"" where we're sent back to last March is not a scientific reality. Sure, it is theoretically possible, but that's a long way from saying it's probably going to happen. So what does the current scientific consensus actually tell us about the Covid variants? Mainly that Covid mutates relatively slowly (approximately half the rate of flu),^(5) sometimes into variants that are somewhat more infectious, but there is still no evidence that it can fully evade immunity (the J&J vaccine was actually tested against the S. Africa variant and found to be 64% effective against moderate-to-severe Covid and 100% effective against hospitalization and death).^(6) It's also important to note that there are only so many ways the virus can mutate. The virus is able to infect cells because the spike protein on its surface has a shape that lets it bind very strongly to proteins in lung cells called ACE2 receptors. In order for the virus to escape immunity, it needs to mutate the spike protein so significantly that the immune system no longer recognizes it, while still also having the spike protein be a good ""fit"" for the ACE2 receptor (the immune response to both Covid infection and vaccination is also such that the immune system can recognize a variety of different Spike protein ""shapes,"" which is why there is also protection against variants). In fact, some of the variants feature the same mutation patterns, which suggests that the virus has about reached the limit of productive mutations (i.e., those that increase its infectiousness).^(7)

So why should we expect Covid to disappear when something like the flu stays with us, and even needs annual vaccines? In short, flu and Covid are caused by fundamentally different viruses with different types of genomes. [This](https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1353057276320313344) twitter thread is a fantastic summary of why. In short, flu viruses have genomes composed of 8 pieces that are able to mix and match with each other inside a host. Flu has several different animal hosts that it can reside in, so even when there isn't an epidemic in humans, it is still able to circulate and reassemble itself into a form that our immune system has never seen before. Covid's genome, on the other hand, is a single piece that can only mutate at specific points, and not through an entire reassortment like the flu. This is all to say that empirical evidence suggests immunity is long-lasting, and this is backed up by our understanding of Covid's viral mechanisms. Covid also doesn't freely circulate among several different animal hosts that humans farm, which means the odds of another crossover event after it's eradicated from humans are much lower (this is why we haven't seen a resurgence of the original SARS).

I understand the frustration with people who ignore easy health measures like wearing masks and getting vaccinated. It's also almost certainly true that they have unnecessarily drawn out the pandemic. But to say that they are the reason that we will never get to the end of the pandemic is ignorant of a huge body of scientific work that has been done in the past year which suggests otherwise. As always, we should keep the facts in mind first and foremost even if they may disagree with our preconceptions.

**Whiting out a puppy's medical history?** That's what The Puppy Store was caught doing. In addition to selling dogs from cruel puppy mills to unsuspecting customers, they've now been caught deliberately hiding at least one puppy's medical record in order to deceive prospective buyers.

What was covered up underneath that whiting out?

“It said to keep him on a 24-hour watch,” Grant said. “Underneath it also said, ‘Watch for symptoms for 10-to-14 days, if none, healthy.’”  
 ""Grant’s vet would later diagnose Kota with pneumonia.""

The store manager blamed an ""overzealous"" employee for the situation, who he said has since been terminated. If you happen to know anything more about what happened or the everyday practices of this pet store, please reach out to me! I would love to hear your story."|LasVegas|2023|True|0
"Vermonters ages 18-29:  it’s finally your turn! Here's the info you need to find a shot starting Monday, April 19th and/or move up your appointment slot:

# How do I sign up?

**There are 4 main places to look for vaccines:**

* [VT Department of Health](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration)
   * **This is the main clearinghouse for Vermont appointments and the best place to start, with clinic locations in every county.** Some counties have more appointment slots per capita than others (Rutland County, for example, has a high capacity clinic in Rutland and typically does not fill up as quickly as Addison/Grand Isle/Franklin/Washington. Chittenden has many high capacity clinics and also many people, so earlier appointments will fill quickly but there are often slots available for a couple weeks out).
   * **Online registration is expected to open at 6AM on Monday.** Previous groups were told it would open at 8:15am and it opened anywhere from 15-30 minutes early, so be aware that it may not open at 6 on the dot. *ETA*: it opened at 5:50AM.
   * **It is a good idea to pre-register online** so you've already entered the info that takes the most time to fill out. Be aware that there will be another set of questions to answer after the system opens but before you can get through to the scheduler.
   * The call line  (855-722-7878) opens at 8:15AM and is a good option if you have trouble with the online system.
* [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine)
   * CVS and Walgreens both receive weekly or semi-weekly vaccine allocations that are separate from the state through the federal pharmacy program. **CVS and Walgreens's online systems only book out for 4-5 days ahead of time, and release appointments at somewhat random times, usually in the early morning.**
   * CVS locations in VT: Barre, Bennington, Burlington, Colchester, Essex, Morrisville, Rutland, South Burlington, and Williston.
   * **You do not need an account to make an appointment.** Once you've clicked an appointment time for the first and second doses, CVS will hold those slots for you for 30 minutes while you fill out the rest of the info. This is a huge relief, as you don't have to rush through the fillable fields.
   * **If you're up late tonight or before 6AM tomorrow, check CVS and Walgreens first just in case.**
      * If no locations in Vermont have appointments available on the front page, you can click through another state that does have available appts to reach the scheduler. This saves you a little time if you want to hang out on the zip code search page.
      * Often in the early morning you'll hit a waiting room as you try to get through to the scheduler (either ""we are adding new appointments, check back later"" or a message about high traffic).  If you reach a waiting screen, just keep refreshing and eventually it will take you through to the scheduling system - but it might take >30 minutes.
      * Zip codes can be searched by the first 3 numbers (e.g., ""054"" for Chittenden County) to cast a slightly wider net.
* [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/schedulevaccine)
   * Like CVS, Walgreens only schedules appointments 4-5 days out. In the past, it's mostly released new appointment slots at 7AM, but in the last week releases have been at random times through the day. It releases a wave of appointments every few days.
   * **Unlike CVS, you need an account to make an appointment.** It helps to make one ahead of time, so your information will already be filled out if new slots are released.
   * Also unlike CVS, Walgreens does not hold your appointment slot once you've clicked a time. Move fast when you're entering info.
   * The Walgreens site is glitchy. Sometimes you'll hit an error screen if you aren't logged in to your account, or if you're in a browser that Walgreens doesn't like. Try logging in first, then try a different browser if you're still running into issues.
* [Kinney Drugs](https://kinneydrugs.com/pharmacy/covid-19/vaccination-scheduling/vt/)
   * Kinney has the easiest scheduling system to navigate among the pharmacies, but relatively fewer appointments. It apparently updates on a weekly basis, but appointments have remained nearly full except at a couple locations for the last two weeks. Kinney schedules many weeks out, and their short-term availability is random. ETA: all Kinney appointments are full as of 7AM Monday.
   * Each location either distributes Moderna or Pfizer; the Pfizer locations are listed separately [here](https://kinneydrugs.com/pharmacy/covid-19/vaccination-scheduling/vt/pfizer-locations/) to make them easier to find for 16-17 year olds.
   * **You can check, but it's mostly going to be luck in finding a cancellation until Kinney adds new appointments.**
   * You do not need an account to make an appointment, but it doesn't hold a time once you've clicked on it - **you'll need to enter your info quickly to secure a spot** that opens up. Auto-fill can come in handy on this site.

***ETA:*** **If you're over 16 and live close to New Hampshire, you can also receive the vaccine in NH. Their registration system is all-in-one and can be found here:** [**https://vini.nh.gov/providers/s/**](https://vini.nh.gov/providers/s/). It looks like there may be some openings available this week in the Lebanon/Hanover area.

# Once I've secured a spot, are there ways I can move up to an earlier appointment?

**Yes! If you've booked a slot for several weeks out, do not lose hope! It's absolutely worth checking all four of these sites to see if something has opened up earlier.**

* tl;dr: F5 (refresh button) is your friend! Check back regularly at all four sites and you’ll almost certainly move up your appointment.
* The state regularly adds new clinics, and people who find pharmacy appointments will (and SHOULD) cancel any existing state appointment, opening up those earlier slots at random times. Once you've booked an appointment through the state, you can click  the ""Reschedule"" button (don't worry, hitting that button will not cancel your appointment!) and keep refreshing the county you're interested in to see if any earlier times have popped up. Check nearby counties too, if you have the ability to get there!
* CVS and Walgreens are your best bet for moving up to an appointment that's only a couple days out. Check in the early mornings (midnight to 6AM for CVS, 7AM for Walgreens).
* A handy site to check throughout the day is [Vaccine Spotter](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/VT/), which scrapes and maps out available appointments from the pharmacy sites. It can often be a few minutes behind, but it saves you the trouble of going through the individual sites and zip code searches. There are also a few Twitter accounts that share releases/updates using the #OurShotVT hashtag.
* *ETA*: There's a new tool that uses the Vaccine Spotter API to send email notifications when new appointments pop up in your area. There's a few minute delay, but it could come in handy if you'd rather not sit there refreshing! Sign up here: [https://covid-vaccine-notifications.org/](https://covid-vaccine-notifications.org/)

**IMPORTANT: If you manage to book an earlier appointment, please remember to cancel any existing appointment** to open it up to others in the queue!!

# Other FAQs:

* *Do I need insurance? Does the vaccine cost anything?*
   * No, it's free through all of the systems! If you have insurance, you'll be asked to enter that info as it will help cover the cost to the state or pharmacy.
* *Can I choose which vaccine I get?*
   * The vaccine that's being distributed at a particular site will be listed up front in whichever system you use, so you'll know  which you're getting. Right now, they're still only scheduling Moderna or Pfizer at all locations (state and retail pharmacy). J&J is expected to resume scheduling around Friday of this week.
* *Do I need to bring anything with me?*
   * I was not asked for my driver's license or insurance card at a state site, but you may be asked for both at a retail pharmacy location. Technically, you don't need either.
* *What are the side effects? When should I expect them to kick in?*
   * The side effects are your immune system at work! The most common symptoms of the first dose of either Moderna or Pfizer are a sore arm, starting anywhere from 0-12 hours after the shot, and fatigue from 12-24 hours.
   * Symptoms are usually stronger after the second dose, when your immune system has already been primed to respond; they are also typically stronger after the first dose if you've already had COVID than if you've never had it. You'll most likely have a sore arm again, which may be accompanied by fatigue/muscle aches/headache/sore lymph nodes/chills/short fever. Aka, general crumminess that hits its peak about a day after the vaccine.
   * Treat the day after vaccine like you would a cold or a hangover: rest and fluids with electrolytes are your friend.
* *When am I protected from the virus?*
   * **It takes time for the antibodies to build up in your body. You're not protected immediately!**
   * For the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, you do not have much protection for the first 7-10 days and should continue to follow all of the same precautions as pre-vaccine. Antibodies ramp up quickly after 10-12 days, and efficacy against symptomatic infection is estimated at around 60% once you're two weeks past the first dose, up to over 80% at four weeks past the first dose. Efficacy against any infection isn’t far behind (a little under 50% at two weeks past the first dose, [according to data on Pfizer from Israel](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765?query=featured_home)).
   * Efficacy reaches 90-95%+ around two weeks after the second dose. This doesn't mean you couldn't have a breakthrough infection - and you should definitely still get tested if you come down with COVID symptoms - but it's a lot more unlikely at this point!
* *Do I need to keep wearing a mask? What can I do when I've waited it out and am fully vaccinated?*
   * It depends on the context! Until vaccination starts to send community case rates to a much lower threshold, you'll still need to wear a mask and distance in public spaces and gatherings of people that aren't fully vaccinated (the list of unvaccinated people includes children, who probably won't be able to get the vaccine for months).
   * But new doors will open: you can gather indoors with other fully vaxed people. And hug them. And feel the relief of being much more protected from infection yourself. The current CDC recommendations on what you can do post-vax are [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html).
   * Lots of fun stuff with friends is on the horizon (bars? indoor dining? DJ Taka Fridays? maybe even VT Brew Fest?) #Shotgirlsummer is coming y'all.

Good luck and good hunting! Feel free to chime in with other hot tips. Happy to help answer any lingering questions!"|Vermont|2021|True|0

"WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON COLLEGE STUDENTS COMING BACK ? ** 


Some colleges in greater Boston will have their students learn mostly from home like MIT and Harvard. While most will be bringing the majority of their students back on campus to a mix of in person and online classes. Which is what my school is doing. 

I’m a Boston native and I personally wouldn’t feel too safe on a campus this fall because of possible long term effects of the virus, but I probably will be on campus cause I can’t take all my classes online. 

What I’m more worried about is the tens of thousands of students coming back from all over the U.S - some in major hotspots - coming back and setting Massachusetts back after all of our efforts to contain this virus. By the time colleges start again the U.S will have reached 100,000 + new cases per day. 

I also know students will not follow rules to contain the virus. They will still have parties and travel outside of campus. 

What are your opinions on the matter ? I am anxious because of how other states have failed to contain the virus and I don’t want us to have to lockdown again because of an increase in cases because of an influx of students from around the country. But I know some colleges need the money from students and that students spend a lot of money in our businesses."|Boston|2020|True|0
"So this isn’t a question or anything pressing but I’m an incoming college freshman from Texas, and Boston is my favorite city. Seriously just lurking on this subreddit makes me homesick (despite Boston not being “””home””” but my family is from there and that’s always where I wanted to end up.)

I had a flight to Boston early in the summer, which in retrospect was stupid since I’d be coming up in August anyway but I missed it so much, and I wanted to have time to check things out before moving in and such. Of course that didn’t happen lmao

Probably sounds corny as hell but I was watching a dorm tour video and the girl had a huge window facing the Common, and I nearly cried watching it. I’ve only been to the city twice but it’s unbearable being away (and not just because Texas’ handling of the virus is absolutely brutal... help) I last visited near Christmas and actually liked the weather aside from the dirty slush on the pavement whenever it wasn’t snowing. 

Ugh... I miss the ocean and the good bagels and the old ass houses. And the people (no southern hospitality here but I don’t mind) and the unbelievably steep stairs..... I could go on. 

That’s it. That’s all I wanted to say. But also if anyone has more cool Boston-themed pictures or favorite places I don’t mind missing it a little more and would love to hear about them."|Boston|2020|True|0
I’d ballpark that around 80% of people are not wearing masks. I walked/drove through Edgartown and Oak Bluffs today and was extremely saddened to see people not giving a shit. The island cannot  handle an outbreak and people need to realize that. There are a total of 3 ICU beds at the hospital. Mostly everyone I saw not wearing a mask looked like they were tourists, so they are undoubtedly heading back to their respective homes after their stay on the island. I’m assuming they will be spreading the virus back in their communities as well. Moral of the story, wear your fucking mask please.|Boston|2020|True|0

"I know many people are discussing the very real reality that protesting right now will likely lead to an influx of cases. I haven’t yet seen a conversation from those of us who are choosing to protest - how are you managing risk on a daily and weekly basis?

My partner and I are both deeply committed to justice for Black people and feel showing up for protests is important for us to do. Here are the kinds of things we are planning to put in place to keep others safe from us should we have the virus. Neither of us have a compromised immune systems, we don’t live with or care for our parents, and both of us work from home. Other than protests, we are only around other people when we need to grocery shop.

We are thinking of doing the following:

- obviously wearing masks during protest, using hand sanitizer etc.
- attending 1 protest a week so that we can hopefully catch COVID symptoms before we go to the next one (recognizing that we could be a symptomatic spreaders). 
- if we feel sick AT ALL, we will not attend a protest. 
- driving or walking to all protest, no public transportation
- getting tested (we are trying to figure out how often we should do so, as we don’t want to over use the resource)

I would appreciate any other ideas on how people are minimizing risk while committing to the important practice of protest. I understand many will not make this choice due to COVID, but hopefully this can be a space for those of us to feel strongly about protesting AND care deeply about public health. After all, racism and COVID are both public health issues!"|Boston|2020|True|0
"I put together this website in support of a restaurant I worked at in college that's at risk of permanent closure due to COVID-19.

"Hi Boise, 

I have been sick for the last 10 days with flu like symptoms but not a hint of respiratory symptoms. Fever, chills, body aches, headaches, vomiting, skin rashes/scratchy skin, insatiable thirst. The symptoms are not all the time and change from day to day.

I went to urgent care 4 days in and tested negative for flu/Covid /cold, urine looked good too. 6 days in, I attempted to take a shower and lost my vision and was able to make it to my bed before falling - no color in face and lips slightly blue. Went to ER. Had chest x-ray, blood work, and ultrasound of my right side organs. Bloodwork showed signs of my body fighting something. Negative for cold/flu/Covid/RSV, urine looked good again. ER believes it’s some sort of virus they do not test for and to drink lots of water, rest, and it should resolve itself. 

Now I’m on day 10 (4 days since ER), and still feel like garbage and no diagnosis. 

Boise - has anyone had or is anyone having similar symptoms? We’re you able to pinpoint what the cause was? How long did the symptoms last for?"|Boise|2023|True|1

"Considering Philadelphia as a place to get jobs and rent an apartment and make friends and stuff and we have a few questions about how it is skateboarding out there. 

One: East Coast skateboarding is so sick, but we're from the West Coast and we're a little worried about the weather. Are you able to skate through the winter/rainy seasons? We don't really mind if the parks get wet and we have to skate flat for a few weeks here and there, but I'm worried that we're gonna feel like we're always fighting the elements! 

Two: We're primarily interested in University City/West Philly because it seems more chill and more cost friendly. Are there spots out there or are all the spots in Center City? If so, how easy is it to commute over there? We'll probably buy a scooter but we're also down to skate/bike or take the train/bus wherever.

"Take my story this may shed some light on how you got started or a loved one is getting started, I’m open for conversation if anyone needs to talk. So here’s how my hell started  

Gave a “friend” a ride cause he needed to pick up some “weed” he was 17 I was 18 at the time. Pull up to this house he goes in and all seems normal. So I expect a little hit for the ride ya know, we get almost back to his place. “Can I take a quick hit before you dip I’m dry rn.” He says na man it’s all I got for the day sorry. I tell him I’ll smoke him out in a few hours when I get off work.. I see it in his face he feels bad he didn’t have no weed for me or money... He felt bad enough that he wanted to tell me the truth, which was that he didn’t pick up any weed at all he picked up H.

I’ve tried perks but I’ve never even seen H so I say bullshit let me see. Expecting to see that black gooey tar heroin, but no he pulls out a bun. 10 wax baggies wrapped in a rubber band and he pulls one off the top and gives it to me to look at. “This ain’t heroin wtf is this shit.”

It’s heroin bro I usually give my ride a bag for taking me to pick up... “I’m sick as fuck” he says, “I got to go get right.” He jumps out the car and runs inside like a hobbit to go get his fix. Leaving me with the weird wax baggie... so I take this bag home and seal it up in a ziplock bag like it was fragile or something lol. idk what to fucking do with it and I know for a fact I’m not shooting anything into my veins, i don’t want to flush it.. I’m curious. 

Next day I show another “friend” of mine the bag and he looks at me and says WTF are you doing why TF do you have that shit. John gave it to me for a ride and idk what to do with it. He takes it out my hand and opens it, after opening it he flicks the bag and in the morning light I see a little cloud float above the top of the bag then he takes a big whiff, I guess to inspect the contents? ... “yeah bro it’s dope” I’ve tried it and I didn’t like it. “How?” Did you really shoot up.... “NO dumbass” I snorted it. WAIT YOU CAN SNORT IT! Yeah look, takes out a bill and dumps the clumpy white powder out. Takes another bill and rolls it up and tells me to try it. Just like that I try it. 

Snorted it all and said “this taste like shit.” He laughs.. I don’t even think much of it after that, he rips the bag open and licks it? Wtf was that...  he said idk I seen someone else do it before, this shit sucks whatever so I start my car an go to pull out of the park and all a sudden i get a drip down the back of my throat, Then I get this HUGE smile on my face. WOAHHH I think I feel it, he starts laughing hahahaha yeah I bet you do. 

I start rambling and driving around aimlessly laughing and having the time of my life... suddenly I say wtf dude I think it’s gone already.. how much was that bag worth? 5$ (US)... so you only get high for a couple minutes for 5 dollars? Then he says naaa you can do 2 or 3 bags and get real high.. 

ohhhhhhhhh INSTANTLY call my boy who gave it to me to try and get more. He laughs maniacally over the phone after I literally said “I want more” he says “ I need a ride anyways come scoop me.” I tell my friend who just showed me how to use the dope that I’m going to give john a ride to get more. He says he doesn’t want to go and to let him out at his house.. “whatever bro I’ll hit you up later” So now me and joe take a ride to see his boy, I ask how much does it cost.. 50 (US) for a bun.. damn that’s expensive but whatever it will probably last me a month so I say alright let’s go. 

“Okay but don’t do it everyday or you will get hooked he says..” I know I know I’m not stupid bro I’m only going to do It every once in a while. This kid gets a grin on his face like the devil and says “Ight, hurry up though cuz I’m getting sick” so I do.. And from then on I was in a hurry too, I was also sick and I played that game for 5 long long years. Oh how I wish I could go back and flush that one little baggie down the toilet fuck how I wish. Please be careful, it will win and it will hurt.

"My birthday is this weekend and I  was looking for ideas for something to do for a group of 6 people. I like in East Valley, birthdays usually consist of dinner, or a pool day BBQ at someones house. I have cabin fever though.

Was thinking Medieval Times or something. I didn't see any mystery dinner theaters that were available this weekend. I'm not opposed to dinner somewhere, but was looking for a bit of an experience. Any ideas? Have you done anything you really enjoyed that stood out?

I'm turning 29 and my friend group is in the same age range.

"Over the years Ill get a bug up my ass and want to make some good old pepperoni rolls like my grandmother did.  Growing up in Wheeling I didn't have a ton of options but when DiCarlo's sold them for a while I loved those but the best mass-produced ones (IMO) are from Barney's.  I ordered a box of 24 but the cost of them plus shipping makes it more of a annual treat more than a regular occurrence.  Some places around Savannah, GA have things they call ""pepperoni rolls"" but I'm quickly turned off when I take a bite and they put HAM OR SOME OTHER CRAP THAT'S not PEPPERONI or CHEESE inside.  This opens up a parallel argument of the ""grilled cheese vs melt"" trope where if a grilled cheese includes anything other than bread, cheese, and fat it's a melt.

So I've tried making them multiple times.  Using various recipes found online they never turned out right for me.  I'll see some and glance over them, try a couple, and some are grand slams out of the park but some are just ""meh"" in the end.  

So those of you who make your own, what recipe do you use?  It's fine if it's just one you found on AllRecipes or some other site, but mine usually involves me making a batch of white bread dough from the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook and using freshly sliced deli pepperoni and provolone (if I use cheese at all) and sometimes I'll brush on some melted butter and add a dash of garlic salt over the top.

As for my kitchen arsenal, I have a good old Kitchenaid stand mixer and a nice collection of commercial grade half and quarter sheet pans at my disposal.  Pro tip: go to any restaurant supply store and get some half and quarter sheet pans.  The quarter pans are great for things like grilling so you can avoid cross-contamination and the pans can be had for around $5-10 each depending on the vendor.  They last years in commercial bakeries and my set has lasted me over 10 years with minimal wear.  

So what recipe is your go-to?  The wife and I were planning on driving up this fall but with the virus screwing up our finances it kinda put things on the backburner for a few years, plus I'm currently working to change jobs so a vacation early on in a new job will be out of the question for the most part.

Thank you folks so very much!  Montani Semper Liberi"|WestVirginia|2020|True|0
"Hello, everyone. I need some suggestions. 
My boyfriend used to work as an Amazon delivery driver. He quit because he kept getting hurt and his last straw was the blizzard we had back in January when he was forced to stay on the road & almost got into a few accidents. Since then however, it seems like he’s been in pain. Figured it was his body cause of how many times he fell. He thought it would get better. He told me the pain comes and goes or he could take Tylenol and be alright. 

Recently, however, it seems like it’s been getting worse. He says he’s starting to get migraines, it feels like his entire body is in pain, can’t barely sleep. 

Then last night, he told me that when he had first started, he was going to deliver a package, it was raining & he ended up slipping and falling. He said he kept sliding and had to brace himself to hit the stoop. He said he hit his lower back first, then hit his neck at end like between his shoulder blades. 
He did tell his boss, who told him to just keep going.
I remember him calling me and telling me he fell and that he was okay but never told me all the details until last night. 
I remember him calling in the next day cause he felt some soreness but didn’t think anything of it.
He kept working like normal until he quit. 

I looked up his symptoms and based on how he’s been feeling recently, it sounds like he feeling the effects of whiplash. 

So basically, my question is are there any low-cost chiropractors? We don’t have a ton of money at the moment as I just got a new job but don’t start for another week. He’s also trying to go back to work but jobs he wants to do could possibly damage his body even further. But I do know based on this new information, he needs to be seen ASAP.

Thank you in advance ☺️"|Omaha|2020|True|1
"**TL;DR of rule change: COVID-19 posts are allowed outside of the megathread again**. Please read below for an explanation.

Hello everyone. We've gotten a lot of feedback about our recent rule change that requires COVID-19 posts to be made as comments in the COVID megathread, much of it negative. Quite frankly, we were a bit divided about the rule as well, and have found that our trial run of it has not panned out as we had hoped. Our goals were to reduce the amount of unhelpful or downright misleading posts about this very serious situation, while still allowing actual news articles containing valuable information to be shared. Unfortunately, this resulted in some otherwise good posts getting relegated to the megathread. As such, we've decided to rescind that rule, and allow **Omaha-related** COVID-19 posts again. Rules about news article titles remain in effect, and **we will continue to remove misinformation/disinformation surrounding COVID-19**, and hand out temporary/permanent bans as appropriate. Please keep sharing good information, and encouraging your neighbors to act responsibly to get our community through this difficult time with as little death and sickness as possible.

&nbsp;

Please continue reporting misinformation/disinformation about COVID-19, as well as any other rule-breaking posts. All the reports are seen, and action is taken when appropriate. Thanks as always.

- Fever
- Cough
- Shortness of breath

**[Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html):**

- **Wear a mask** or face covering while in public.
- **Stay home** as much as possible.
- Keep **at least** 6 feet between you and other people when you must go out (like to the grocery store)
- Avoid close contact with people, crowds, or other large gatherings.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
- Cover your coughs and sneezes
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
- If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A note on mask use:**
The CDC, the WHO, UNMC, and the Douglas County Board of Health all recommend mask/facial covering use when in public spaces. I know there is a lot of debate and a lot of anger around mask use, but I am *begging* you: please wear a mask in public. The science shows that they work to *reduce* (**not** eliminate) the spread of respiratory viruses, and wearing one does not cause harm or cost you anything. If you're reading this and are about to get upset with me, please take a moment to read about [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager). If masks *do* work and you wear one, you've improved the world, but if you don't wear one you've harmed the world. If they *don't work*, wearing one also causes no harm just like not wearing one. Choose the option with the maximum odds of doing *good* -- wear a mask. In addition, here are some peer-reviewed scientific papers indicating the efficacy of various types of masks at source control, viral infection containment, and reducing transmission rates:

"While talking to a coworker today, I came to the conclusion that capitalism is to blame for the bus driver getting stabbed.

There is an endless loop to squeeze money out of the average person.

Prisons are privatized, they love their repeat customers and are already packed to the brim. There is no rehab in jail, just indoctrination to malevolence.

Car gets broken into? Pay for a new window and purchase what has been stolen.

Drugs on the streets? Who supplies them and why? Drugs are a major market and fuel the capitalistic system.

Medicine, and healthcare, this topic is fresh on our minds these days. Money, money and money, no help just profit. 

Healthy living and eating? Forget about it, they want you sick and miserable.

There will be no change because those on top are profiting off all of us through this endless loop.

Our society is a house of cards, greed has hollowed it out. No trust in others, which is exactly what the system wants. Individuals struggling to survive, blinded by small differences.

Politics? We change party but never policy. I view society like the Roman colosseum. The rich being fanned with a big leaf, while being fed grapes, entertained to watch us struggle to live. Issues like drag queens reading to children being swords people pick up to fight. Smoke and mirrors all around us.

Tldr: The capitalistic system is what is causing many to suffer around us. No one can even stop to help, just carry on and be thankful it has not affected them. The Front Bottoms have a song that says, ""we are all eventually, either the victims or the victim's family."" It is just a matter of time because of greed."|seattle|2024|True|0
"I have a friend of mine who lives down in Des Moines and he has been in a hellhole of an apartment he can barely pay for the last several years. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia a long time ago and he has the inability to sign up for disability. I feel bad for his cats because they rely on him for food and he's barely keeping it together. I know there's plenty of groups out there that venture out to homeless camps to give folks basic supplies and narcan, but I don't know of any groups that help prevent people from being homeless and getting back on their feet again. 

About a year ago, I tried helping him... I gave him a hundred dollars, told him to sign up for Apple Healthcare (which is crazy that he wasn't on it already) and find a case-worker to talk to, so they could figure out how to dole out dosability money to him properly. All i heard from him a month later was that he owned the disability office something like 15k and they could arrest him if they wanted to, then he continually kept on asking money in random intervals, to which I said ""no"", explained that he needed to pay me back before I loaned him more money, then asked me again two weeks later. It was super frustrating because I basically caused him to have that dependency. He's been in and out of several mental health wards where he voluntarily checked himself in as well. I've noticed with a lot of programs out there that they will tell someone to fuck off as long as they have a house over their heads and it was like this even back when my mom was sick in 2008 and her bank tried to foreclose on her house."|seattle|2024|True|0

Four (4) times in 2024 (that I can recall at least somewhat vividly) I have been way too close to getting mowed down by a person riding a Lime scooter on a sidewalk. TWO of these times happened within the past 3 days. 

I know it’s beating a dead horse at this point on this sub, but all I’ve been able to think about since around September is the story of the older gentleman in California that was hit by someone on a Lime scooter, hit his head on the concrete, and died in the hospital. 

The fact that I’ve had SO many close calls, close enough to where it scares the shit out of me so much after it happens that I need to stand there and breathe for a minute, when I do everything to be as careful as I can be, here comes some dickhead FLYING by on a crowded sidewalk, carelessly weaving around people. 

How do I do ANYTHING about this as an individual? Who would even be in charge of getting these things banned within the city? I know it must be possible, since I went to Portland for the first time about a month and a half ago and it was so refreshing to not see a single one of those things.

***Jingle Pills: A Holiday Safety Song***

*Lyrics by Washington Poison Center*

*To the tune of Jingle Bells*

The holidays are here,  
A time for joy and cheer!  
Families reunite,  
With traditions we hold dear!  
But listen closely, friends,  
To keep this season bright,  
Beware of grandma’s pill stash—  
Let’s get her meds stored right!  
  


🎶 **Chorus:**  
Pill boxes! Pill bottles!  
Keep them out of sight!  
Kids can grab them easily,  
And give you quite a fright!  
Lock them up, store them high,  
Keep all meds secure!  
Or the gift you’ll get this holiday  
Is an ER adventure! 🎶  
  


Weekly pill reminders,  
A danger in disguise,  
With bright and shiny colors  
That catch a toddler’s eyes.  
Child-resistant caps  
Won’t always do the trick,  
And pills left out in open spots  
Can make kids really sick!  
  


🎶 **Chorus:**  
Pill boxes! Pill bottles!  
Keep them out of sight!  
Kids can grab them easily,  
And give you quite a fright!  
Lock them up, store them high,  
Keep all meds secure!  
Or the gift you’ll get this holiday  
Is an ER adventure! 🎶  
  


This season, stay alert,  
Spread love, not medication!  
Staying home or visiting,  
Avoid a complication!  
Bring your festive spirit,  
And a safe place to store pills,  
Out of sight and out of reach  
So no one becomes ill!  
  


🎶 **Chorus:**  
Pill boxes! Pill bottles!  
Keep them out of sight!  
Kids can grab them easily,  
And give you quite a fright!  
Lock them up, store them high,  
Keep all meds secure!  
And have a happy holiday  
The safest, brightest way! 🎶

 

In all seriousness, be extra careful with medications this holiday season. One of the most common holiday calls we get is about a child swallowing a grandparent’s medication. This usually happens when the grandparent keeps their pills out in their room or on the counter, in their purse/suitcase, and/or when they use pill boxes or other non-child resistant containers (like a pill vial with non-child resistant cap).

Older adults are often on multiple medications that can cause potentially serious effects in young children. For example, medications to treat high blood pressure, opioids for pain, medications for diabetes, or medications to help you sleep. Any of these alone can be dangerous, but the combinations can be more of an issue.

Cannabis edibles brought into the home are also a common call. These are routinely discovered once a child’s urine is tested and positive for marijuana. Unfortunately, many of these patients undergo an extensive evaluation including head CT, lumbar puncture, and blood draws.

**How can you prevent this?**

·         Identify a storage spot for medications that is out of sight and out of reach of kids. Even better, use a locking cabinet or lock box.

·         Don’t store medications in your purse or bag.

·         Ask visitors to put their purse or bag up and away and show them your designated safe storage spot for meds.  

Call your local poison center (1-800-222-1222) if you think something was ingested. We can assess the individual situation and provide guidance for next steps.

"Look, I love this city, never want to leave, blah blah blah. But sometimes I just get so sick of the *bullshit.*

Case in point ... last night's meeting about [safety upgrades for Lake Washington Blvd](https://www.reddit.com/r/seattlebike/comments/1hai6xi/are_speed_cushions_controversial_lake_washington/). It's taken three years, nineteen meetings, a task force, and a 40-page report to get to the point where the city's installing a couple of speed cushions (not even speed bumps!) but then a couple of rich neighbors complained so we had to have ANOTHERRRRR fucking meeting, waste everyone's time, delay the project, and subject some poor city staffers to hours of abuse. 

You can read live coverage from the meeting from [Ryan Packer at The Urbanist](https://bsky.app/profile/typewriteralley.bsky.social/post/3ld5qz3ftzc2p), and also from [Jason](https://bsky.app/profile/jrock08.bsky.social/post/3ld5qvsxxlk27) skeeting on his own. It's just EXASPERATING. Uninformed randos shouting out that maybe safety upgrades aren't needed because not THAT many people have died in crashes. Wild claims about ""the bike community"" coming to get them. And then just when it was supposed to be over, ANOTHER round of open comments.

The worst part is that the VERY SAME day, the state of WA had a meeting about how [2023 saw the highest number of pedestrian deaths](https://bsky.app/profile/typewriteralley.bsky.social/post/3ld5lhv7ygs2n) ever recorded. And THIS is what we're wasting time on???

And one more gripe ... our elected leaders really threw staff under the bus here. In my pathetically long history of civic engagement, I've learned that meetings like this usually only effective if you can get two parties into the same room: Jerks (members of the public) and crooks (elected officials). Not a single elected official showed up to this. Tonya Woo was there but she couldn't win a pie-eating contest.

Ugh anyway I don't know what the solution to this is. It's a pathetic way to run things, and it makes me want to organize a community group dedicated to stopping public meetings!

At some point we've got to stop jerking off and just BUILD things."|seattle|2024|True|0

"Me and a friend went to substation this last weekend for a show, I was expected to answer my work phone if anyone called so I drank very modestly (3 beers over the course of 3 hours in venue) around 2:30am I started vomiting violently for 36 hours. 

There was a 5’7 Hispanic/italian(?) guy in the back of the club wearing sunglasses I stopped to tell him he smelled nice and asked what he was wearing and e told me he would tell me what it was if I came home with him and I quickly told him I was only asking because I’ve been getting into fragrance. He let me know he was just there to find someone to come home with him and asked who I was with, I pointed to my friend and got a bit of a bad vibe. Two girls near by thought he was talking to them and asked him to repeat himself, he rudely told them he was focused on me. He pressed a little more asking to dance, I did not oblige, he walked into the crowd a for like? 2 minutes and then came back to where we were standing and bumped into me (I didn’t think much of it because the room was PACKED) he kept pressing that he was looking for a hookup and I didn’t want to continue the conversation so I asked someone I was talking to earlier to follow them into the crowd as they passed by effectively getting away from this pushy creep. 

In retrospect, it’s super clear to me he dropped something in my drink when he bumped into me, my can was in my hand low to my hip but NEVER unattended. 

I’ve been out multiple times, and this has NEVER happened to me, I didn’t think it could happen so fast and I can’t believe how SICK I was. 

Does anyone know what kind of drug could cause this? I was not on any elicit substances and was drinking in heavy moderation.

"I’ve been sick the past few days and ordering DoorDash and Uber Eats for my meals. My first order is supposed to be delivered by a Megan, and Megan ends up being a man. Ok whatever, maybe his name is Megan no big deal. The next day I order Uber Eats and Tetiana is supposed to be delivering my food. Her profile photo shows an old lady. Suffice to say the person who delivered my order wasn’t even close to an old lady.

I have no issue with men delivering my food, but I can’t help but wonder why would you lie on your profile?? Fake name and fake photo?? Giving them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they are delivering on behalf of their mom or sister or wife? Or maybe they get tipped better when people think they’re an old lady? But twice in a row in a single day makes it seem like more of the norm. As a woman I’d be naive to not think of the alternative reason men would be using women’s names and photos for their profiles when they’re coming to my doorstep…

After the second time I am just having my husband be the one to accept the orders out of an abundance of caution. 

Posting to raise awareness for other women so you don’t come to the door with your guard down thinking a woman is delivering your food. I might just change my own name to be my husband’s so they aren’t expecting a woman to meet them anyways. 

Also I did report them to Uber eats and DoorDash because they have specific policies stating they can’t have fake profiles. "|seattle|2024|True|1

"[Our Medical Director found these picture perfect poisonous mushrooms \(amanita muscaria\) in our parking lot.](https://preview.redd.it/3qdgczps6w1e1.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b45eed3dd752f30f7ed1cfdbd117cefee93a4d7)



At the Poison Center, we say “all mushrooms are edible, some only once.” With it being the season of fungus among us, we’re finding ourselves saying this more and more often...

Thankfully, most of the calls we get about mushrooms don’t result in anything more serious than an upset stomach. Many calls are about young kids who take a small bite of a backyard shroom. They typically don’t eat enough (less than a *cap*ful) to get very sick.  

It gets more interesting when adults get into a mushroom mishap, though, as they usually prepare their foraged finds in a meal and consequently eat *morel* than a child. When these folks eat the wrong kind of mushroom, they can end up with symptoms including severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, hallucinations, kidney, and even liver failure.

We've got a couple of our notorious mushroom caller stories for you:

·         One family member went foraging with a friend who was “very experienced.” They were searching for matsutake (*Tricholoma murrillianum)* mushrooms. One mushroom was smaller than the rest, but they threw it in to the soup anyway. Their entire family ate the soup. After a couple of hours, all 4 of them experienced profuse vomiting and diarrhea, so they gave us a call. We helped them out over the course of a couple days, until their symptoms finally resolved. We think they may have mistakenly foraged an *Amanita Smithiana* (Smith’s Amanita).

https://preview.redd.it/2dvlenwffw1e1.png?width=334&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a276aacd2f262dc5c79734ad81770bd4f7e2601

·         An adult male called us reporting he was lightheaded, dizzy, and flushed after eating what he thought was a Shaggy Mane (*Coprinus comatus)*. We asked him a bunch of questions and learned he had also had a couple of beers with dinner. His symptoms resolved by the following morning. We think he had accidentally eaten an Inky Cap (*Coprinopsis atramentaria)* and given himself what’s called a “disulfiram reaction.” Inky cap mushrooms contain a chemical called coprine, which interferes with your body's ability to break down alcohol. Normally, your liver processes alcohol into harmless substances, but coprine stops this process midway, causing a buildup of toxic compounds.

When it comes to wild mushrooms, there isn’t *mush*\-room for mistakes. So, here’s how you can prevent getting green in the *gills*, or much worse:

1.      **Don’t eat them.** Seems obvious, but we gotta say it. Unless you're a mushroom expert, it's best to avoid wild mushrooms altogether. This isn’t a *morel* dilemma... Many toxic types look suspiciously like edible varieties, and even the experts can be fooled. You don't want to truffle with the wrong one and risk getting sick.

2.      If you’re going to forage, **learn how from local experts (a** ***fun-gi*** **or gal, perhaps?)**. Get some field experience with them before heading out on your own.

3.      **Only try one part and one type of a foraged mushroom at a time.** This helps us pinpoint the toxin and treat you as quickly and effectively as we can!

4.      **Snap photos like that mushroom has a budding modeling career** before you cook up your finds. Not just an Instagram worthy side shot, get them at all angles. When you call us for help, we’ll have you email us the photo so we can identify the type of mushroom.

5.      **Call us right away at 1-800-222-1222** if you feel nauseous, start vomiting, or have diarrhea. We’re here to help, and with the right info, we can get you back on your stalk in no time.

"I've always had anxiety but over the past year it's been causing me debilitating stomach issues. My work has a stupid rule in our contract that we cannot have more than 5 ""occurrences"" per year. In other words, we can only call out 5 times a year. It's stupid, and I haven't minded it much until now because I'm a generally very healthy person and don't get sick often, but now that my anxiety is getting really bad I'm having to call out more often because of my debilitating gastrointestinal issues. 

I'm looking into applying for intermittent FMLA so that in the event I need to call out past the 5 measly callouts we get a year that I'll be protected. I'm having a really confusing time understanding if I need to be applying for regular old FMLA and PFML. I wouldn't need it to be continuous, and would intend to use it only here and there as needed to manage my symptoms. Hoping someone else out there in the Seattle area has been through this and might be able to point me in the right direction!"|seattle|2024|True|0
"Hi all,

We’re (legal) immigrants and have a friend struggling with pneumonia.

She was taking to the urgent care and a PCP where they provided antibiotics. But she’s really very sick and needs more care.

Doctors are not providing with any further medication and she needs to heal on her own.

Now, my question is - what do you do when you’re seriously ill but not in a life threatening condition? Is it just urgent care? The quality of care there does not seem to be at par with what we’re used to, so I’m wondering if we’re missing something.

Thanks, and any comments would be very appreciated!

I am new to Utah living here in Utah county for just about 7 months. I signed an 11 month lease and unfortunately need to break it. I have family obligations which I will share briefly, my grandmother has dementia and it has worsened since my move to utah. There is nobody else in my family capable of caring for her so I need to be close to her, I have worked in nursing homes and am nervous about her being in one and would like her to be in her home as long as possible. Where I am from you can break a lease with a fee and pay rent on the apartment until it is rented out then it’s prorated with 30 day notice. When I called the leasing office here they want 60 day notice, 2 more months rent and then $2670 which would be illegal where I am from. I was wondering if this is the norm here? The complex I rent from has been a constant headache with tons of hidden fees, breaking their obligations and from my understanding I don’t have a lot of rights as a renter here.|Utah|2022|True|0

I work as a cashier at a car dealership in Wayne County and we have not closed down. It has been busier than usual due to the other business closures and people migrating to the ones that are open. I sit about 10 feet from the full waiting room and interact with 30+ strangers per day. I cash out customers 3 feet away from me and have to touch their credit cards and cash. 

Lysol wipes, spray, and hand sanitizer are the only precautions my work is taking.

For three days within a week I have been experiencing severe migraine level headaches and sinus congestion. No fever or shortness of breath, but enough for me to call off work. I called a Covid-19 hotline to get a screening and they said I wasn't ""high risk"" enough to get tested due to my age and no fever. Even though they won't test me, I still need a doctor's note that says I am symptom-free in order to go back to work. Even if this isn't Covid-19, it is apparent that my workplace is not taking this seriously enough.

I strongly URGE you to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary. I understand many people look at this as a vacation and an opportunity to ""get things done"" (like getting your oil changed etc), but the numbers are climbing every day due to this carelessness.

"Camped out under a shed at the back of my place, I met a man with an  unexpectedly amazing story. This is a retelling of the articulated as I best remember it.

Jeffery was there hanging out with a young fella, a seasonal tour guide, who had invited him over to learn more from the traditional own, as we sat and chat he told us the story of how a mining company had tried to rip him off for the value of his land and then how he enacted a plan to protect his land forever.

""They flew me over to Paris showed me around, took us out to have a good time then offered me 7 million for the mining  rights to the land. I said I'd have to think about it then I'd let them know as soon as I got home I told them no, I know it's worth way more than that.""

The land is surrounded by Kakadu, and one of the amazing stories of this land is that the traditional owners had already surveyed the uranium deposits. Through generations they developed knowledge of sick country, places where you could not stay for prolonged periods of time, due to the negative health consequences associated with those lands. This made it extremely attractive to uranium miners.

""The next time they took me and my family over. Showed everyone a great time and at the end of it offered me 70 million dollars. I told them I would think about it and let them know when I was home. When I got home I figured it out, they would keep flying me to Paris showing me a good time and all I had to do was tell them no each time. So my answer was no."" 

""A few years after that they flew me over again and showed me a great time again, this time the offered me 700 million dollars, again I said I'd think about it and when I got home I told them no. They weren't happy and they let me know about it.""

""After a few years they offered me over to Paris again and had a great time again, but now the offer was 7 billion dollars and they said this is the last offer I would ever receive from them, I said I need to think about it and would let them know when I get home.""

""At this stage I thought they'd start going behind my back to get what they want, using my family against me. So with help, I was able to get it protected as a heritage site through UNESCO, so it could never be mind."" 

I laughed at the audacity to fuck these mining chumps around like he did to leave them sucking their thumb. I told Jeffery they would have had me a 7 million, which would have made me a cheap whore in comparison to it worth and we had a bit of a laugh.

"My mom and I found this stray kitten a few weeks ago. At first it was a welcoming sight to care for an abandoned animal, but now she's turning into a headache. She starts climbing on and scratching things, and she keeps trying to chew on my charging cables. Plus, she has sharp claws when we took her in and she scratched me and my mom a couple of times. She has all of this excessive energy that it's hard for me to go to sleep at night.

We both decided it would be best to take her to a humane society and that she'll find a better home. Unfortunately, things didn't pan out. We went to two different animal shelters and neither of them won't take any animals in and it's appointment only. IndyHumane won't take in any animals until December, and Indianapolis Animal Care Shelter won't take in animals until late October, so we're stuck with her for the time being.

It's not that she's not a bad cat, more in the fact that she's a kitten she has all this excessive energy, everything is still new to her that it's hard to housebreak her, and her claws are very sharp. Our local animal hospital can't trim her nails until the first week of October since all the other weeks are booked. So I don't know what to do now.

So if there are any animal shelters that are open to taking in strays or lost animals, please let me know."|Indianapolis|2024|True|0

It's the question which has played on the minds of plenty of Canberrans in the past month: when is the best time to duck out for those essentials?

One mistimed supermarket run and you could find yourself needing to get a COVID test, in isolation or worse: picking up the virus along with your bread and milk.

After a spell in 14-day quarantine in a share-house, Milan Leonard wanted a more considered approach to grocery shopping in lockdown.  


""Our house had been in isolation for a couple of weeks before that, because [one of my housemates was at the pub](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7393747/masked-up-assembly-works-to-restart-after-covid-close-call/) the day before we had our first case, and getting quite unlucky,"" Mr Leonard said.  


""And then a couple other of our housemates have quite bad COVID anxiety, and so I thought, you know, on the day that we're getting out and raring to get back to the shops because we've run out of supplies, may as well figure out the safest time to go.""

Mr Leonard, an honours student in physics who has worked in data science, analysed ACT Health's list of exposure sites, looking for the best time to go to the supermarket, to minimise the risk he and his three housemates would encounter the virus again.

Across Coles, Woolworths and IGAs in Canberra, the hour between 5pm and 6pm has had the most number of notifications for COVID-19 exposures.  


The best time to go to the supermarket, Mr Leonard's analysis showed, was early in the morning, and in the evening. The number of exposures were much lower after 7pm.

Mr Leonard said in an ideal world, one person would shop for everyone in the share-house.  


""Trying to organise four 20- and 21-, 22-year-olds to get their shopping done and figure out what they want to eat two weeks in advance is definitely not going to happen,"" he said.

About one-fifth of the 827 exposure sites and times identified to noon on Wednesday were at supermarkets, which have put pressure on supermarket workers forced to isolate.  


The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association has lobbied the ACT government for priority vaccinations for supermarket and takeaway food workers. 

""The ACT government acknowledges that there are many essential workers who due to their age have only recently become eligible for a vaccination. However, it is not possible to vaccinate everyone at once,"" a spokesman for ACT Health said.

A spokesman for Woolworths said hundreds of supermarket staff members had needed to isolate during the ACT outbreak, and they were being encouraged to get vaccinated.

""We're actively recruiting for team members across the ACT to help us provide the food and essentials our communities rely on both in-store and online,"" the spokesman said.

A spokeswoman for Coles said the supermarket's staff members were also encouraged to get vaccinated.

""Where a store is particularly impacted by team members in isolation, we rotate team members from other stores and utilise labour hire to assist with tasks like stocking shelves and replenishment,"" the spokeswoman said.  


The majority of exposure sites identified since the start of Canberra's lockdown, on August 12, have been casual or monitor-for-symptoms sites, meaning the risk of contracting COVID-19 was lower. No supermarkets have been identified as public sites of transmission.

Deputy chief health officer Dr Vanessa Johnston on Wednesday said health authorities were not focused on the number of exposure sites being identified in the community, but were assessing the risk they posed.  


""I think you'll note that most of those sites \[identified in the past few days \] are casual or even monitor for symptoms, where we don't actually request or require anyone to have a test. They're much lower risk,"" Dr Johnston said."|canberra|2021|True|0

"I've pretty much run out of coping mechanisms to handle the anxiety from Covid these days. It seems the last 2 years has removed them one by one.

I'm autistic, an introvert and don't have many friends. I require a fairly simple life to cope. I don't do or like sport and have a disability so am limited in the sports I can do.

I used to go bush waking and down to the coast a fair bit to recharge. At the start of 2020 we had the bushfires in Namadgi which burned the areas I used to love bushwalking in. So there went that mechanism. Some roads have reopened, but the bridges and culverts to Orroral Valley, Lego Land and Bomboora Rocks are still closed. Thankfully the track to Gibraltar Falls re-opened but now I can't go there because I live in NSW.

Then I used to go down the coast to recharge. Then Covid came along, and from time to time, including now, that is not an option. 

I also used to go kayaking on Lake Burly Griffin and up to Gibraltar falls because that would help. But I live in NSW, and can't go to either of those locations either.

I can't go to book shops to get a book and libraries are closed, as are the book shops I think. 

Then I'd work on converting a van to a motorhome but now Bunnings is interstate and the local hardware stores don't have the supplies I need.

All of my former coping mechanisms for mental health are gone. I've already had to call the crisis team once for extreme suicidal thoughts and for the first time in my life actually starting to put a plan in action. Today I was speaking to a psychologist and mentioned all this and they started talking about deep breathing. I said a couple of times that I had tried that in the past and it didn't work for me but they kept on talking about it. I just had to end that conversation as it was clear they were not listening to me, or not taking on board what I was saying. Sure I respect that what they were talking about might work for them, and others, but they were disregarding what I was telling them.

So I'm all out of coping mechanisms and ideas. I SO want to go up to Gibraltar falls on a sunny day, but also SO understand the reasons why I can't. Not spreading potential Covid is very important. I have had a headache and flu like symptoms over the past day and today so I got a Covid test this morning. Still not got the results back yet though.

I feel like I am at my wit's end, and am just struggling to cope. I'm also getting fed up with mental health workers saying ""Oh you're so resilient."" I've worked out that's code for ""You're going through a lot of shit, I'm amazed you're still here.""

So yeah, any coping strategies that are suitable for introverts that hate sport? Oh yeah, I don't drink, smoke or use drugs either so hey, don't go suggesting them please. :)"|canberra|2021|True|0
"It looks like the cat's out of the bag, figuratively speaking.  Wuhan (or Kung-Flu as some are calling it) is in a growing number of countries.  With an insanely long 14 day incubation period it's hard to see how this thing isn't already in many more places. 

Since we've got such an amazing medical community here, and I'm sure there are several viroligists and epidemiologists amongst our ranks, what's the prognostication on when the corona virus shows up here?"|Boston|2020|True|0
"Can someone explain what the hell has happened at this underpass and why?  Gradually over the past 3 years, it has become a tent city for homeless and vagrants.  Tons of trash, waste, and debris spilling onto the streets.  You can't even walk from Sepulveda to Sawtelle, it's that crowded - rows and columns of tents.  And a couple times a week, you'll see police officers and sometimes civil workers breaking down the tents and cleaning up the area...only for it to pop back up a day later.  I honestly think homeless people are tracking when the next clean-up happens so that they can claim their spot.  

The part that puzzles me though is why this underpass and why only the north side?  The south side is untouched.  Sometimes you'll see one tent in the large median/divider, but nothing else on the south side.  And it's not b/c there's plenty of room on the north side, as the encampments have started climbing east toward and onto Sepulveda due to the empty lots/buildings.  I still can't figure out why the south side is untouched.  

Anyways, the police used to seize and hold the possessions in storage, but now they just bring garbage trucks, probably due to public health reasons.  Yes, it's unsightly but more importantly it's a symptom of our uncontrollable homeless situation in virtually every part of LA."|LosAngeles|2019|True|0
"Like many Chicago apartments, my living room has a non-functional brick fireplace that has been coated with several layers of white paint. I tested the **bottom layer** of paint from a tiny chip taken from the base of the fireplace and confirmed that it contains lead. The top layer is lead free and the paint is only chipping at the very base of the fireplace where it meets the floor.

I tested the paint because my pet parakeet recently developed neurological problems and died. I had a hunch (which turned out to be correct) that the symptoms were caused by lead poisoning from chewing at the paint. I have no idea how to address this with my landlord.

https://preview.redd.it/vng28jghy55d1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2798b2323ebeea3659d05fb24cda8a87c76dd9c1

* Should I tell my landlord?
* What if I didn't say anything and just covered it with painter's tape?
* If I don't say anything, am I endangering future pets/children?
* If I tell them, will they do some kind of remediation?
* What does remediation entail? Will I/my neighbors have to leave the building while it happens?
* Will they have to check the ""yes, landlord is aware of lead paint"" box in that lead disclosure handout that goes with our lease?
* Can/will my landlord raise the rent because of the remediation?

These are the questions that I'm struggling with. I would really appreciate any advice or personal experience that you can share. Please be kind - I'm still really struggling with the death of my parakeet and of course I feel responsible. He was an amazing bird."|Chicago|2024|True|0
Hi from JoCo KS. My husband needs to go to an urgent care but none around us are open right now. I see a lot of emergency rooms are, but his symptoms are not EMERGENCY.

"Hey everyone.  I'm sure you're sick and tired of out-of-towners asking where to find whiskey...it's Kentucky....go to any store and buy a bottle, right?

I'm in town for a few days for work and I was hoping to find some semi-rare stuff.  Not sure which stores might have better ""non-standard"" selection.  Don't care where I have to drive.

Looking for some of Buffalo Trace's harder to finds (at least where I'm from, maybe they're everywhere here).

Elmer T Lee Single Barrel

Old Charter Oak French Oak

my buddy back home has bottles of each and they are fantastic and I was hoping to find some more...

...or perhaps these are rare enough I wont find them here either, unless I pay way above MSRP.

"I’ve seen nothing but praise for this place so I went to check it out, bracing myself for overhyped overpriced tasty brunch food.

I got the breakfast tacos and they were the worst I’ve ever had. The steak was not edible, the avocado was going bad, the eggs were a greasy mess, and their sauces were ass water. I never throw out food but I had to call it at the third taco because I was feeling sick.

This was the holiday manor location - is the Frankfort Ave location doing the heavy lifting for this chain? Did I just hit them on a bad day? There seems to be an online consensus that they’re one of the best brunch spots in town."|Louisville|2022|True|0
"Mitch McConnell has been one of my two state senators since I was a child. He is always talking the about he is doing what the people of his ""great state"" are asking him to do.... but is he really??? Over 65% of Kentucky residents want Marijuana legalized, yet he won't entertain. Nearly 70% of the people of this ""wonderful country"" want stricter gun laws (not a ban on guns) yet he refuses to do anything. What do we need to do make this turtle without a shell listen to the actual people that pay him to do what WE WANT!!!! 

We need to sit in front of his house in the highlands. No chants no signs. Just stoic silence staring at his house, whether he's home or not, to force him to listen to us. Not just his precious donors. I am so sick and tired of hearing him say that he cares about Kentucky. No he does not!!!!! I guarantee even if I approached him with the most civil discourse he wouldn't listen to a word I had to say because of the color of my skin and that feeling tells me all I need to know about Mitch McConnell."|Louisville|2022|True|0
Is there a blacklist or do not hire list for those who have resigned? I was an alternative certification student with UofL a few years ago and I just wasn't doing well with the middle school I was posted at and felt no coverage or assistance with my classroom management skills no matter how much I asked and was assured I would get. Middle school was never my end goal as I was studying to get my masters as a secondary Ed teacher 8-12. So when my mom got sick and disabled and I felt my mental health waiting from the barrage of middle school students...honestly bullying me. I have worked elsewhere for a few years now with my full certification and I loved high school but I would like to reenter as a high school teacher in JCPS. Did my abrubt resignation a few years back hinder me from getting work in this district ever again? Would there be someone to ask or verify that?|Louisville|2022|True|0
"Full disclosure, I’ve never been to the orchestra before, so I had no idea what I was in for. Someone gave me tickets to see the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, so I did a little wake and bake (all legal, shoutout to Candor) and went this morning.

Fuck me dead what an experience. 

There were like 80 musicians on stage, including a harp, and they were all so sick. At one point, this guy William Barton showed up in the audience and started singing. Then he started playing dideridoo, and suddenly there were three didgeridoo players on stage. I didn't know orchestra was such a rollercoaster. I thought it'd all be like ""ladidadida"" but there were some pretty full on intense bits. 

In one piece the violins did this thing and sounded exactly like birds, and bedore I realised it was them I was looking around the room cause I thought a bird got in. 

The music fully overwhelmed me like I was in a cocoon. Watching the conductor and the bows moving together was fully hypnotic I forgot what time it was what day it was, I don’t think I blinked at all. Is it always like this? Would recommend. Would do again. A+"|brisbane|2024|True|0
"Hey all, I haven't been home to live for 9 years, will be returning in January. (I don't already intend to be off sick from the get go, but as it is, I am off sick now, so I'm inspired to ask the question.)

"Like, the sickest I’ve ever been. I have no idea what I’ve caught but it has absolutely knocked me for a six. This is not your ordinary “get on with it” cold. Not Covid-19.

"## Hello! and welcome back...

Hola Brisbane!

I've been on hiatus for a bit. Went to Rockhampton to visit family, came back sick and am slowly getting back on the horse. Almost forgot what I was working on for a minute there.

The guide will be a bit abridged until I get some things together. The website name is registered and a few other things too but they're all blank af so I'll share a wee bit later. Comedy shows will get added on this tomorrow.

Speaking of comedy... u/WinonaComedy got in touch with a voucher code for Rohan Arneil's show ""Top Of The Food Chain"". Tickets are $20 or $15 with code \*\*foodchain\*\* at Big Chat Comedy Club, Friday 2nd of August from 9PM.

The Enigma Nightclub opens tomorrow night, The Jesus and Mary Chain are playing at the Princess Theatre and Secret Sounds at Roma St Parklands are still going on, every Sunday - just like the Sunday Garden Artist in Residence at The Triffid.

Have a geez and get on with it!

It allows us to boost the signal, to amplify its *power* Not jasper, not feldspar, not rubies Quartz Think about it This is why 5G is dangerous as is the modern world  Our body operates on micro amounts of *electrical impulses* Think of it like a wireless charging dock for an iPhone That's why it is making us sick The modern world is making us sick Psychiatrists cannot understand or seem to want to understand that simple crystal therapy, when done correctly, is the solution The solution is crystalline structures in our blood It is difficult to prove it anymore due to the quacks and con men who pervade the natural sciences, the loss of practitioners and more than anything else the wavelength pollution in the spectrum we operate on Have you ever wondered why they call some illnesses 'the spectrum?' that is because it is linked 

Ancient religion understood this concept - they call this energy *chakras* - but it got lost when the Jesuit corrupted us with 'abrahamic' abstractions from the sun The catholic church peddles this information in order to control, to install a feudal system 

Abrogation! It is the sun which sends these signals 

The sun is risen In the beginning the gods created the heavens and the earths (earths with a plural, with the secret s, carved into school desks worldwide but known to a civilisation long before schools the secret S woven from the basket of Gemorr and the very cornucopia of truth in creation) Astronomy, astrology and the Chakra envigorating nature of the sun Of great use to many an ancient civilisation that 'somehow' knew about simultaneously They weren't educated, by aliens or any other such crackpot rubbish, they simply observed This is before sun worshipping and successful cultures were wiped from the earth and the corrupted abrahamic religions either fully willingly or assisted via poor translatative efforts between Anglo-Saxon language, Aramaic and etcetera, and installed in their place to control Eventually these became Christianity, Judaism, Islam We are in the period of their fasting *right now* This is to keep us down There are incredible links between them all! 

As Prometheus before me, I bring the holy flame to the glass tube, to take a twirl upon a slow curl of smoke emanating from the crystal inside the train toilets, and I find *enlightenment*.

The son. He has risen. The sun, he has risen. Horus rises. Horizon. The sun rises, to bear life upon the earth! Our death is the stellarvore, and represent in our freezing moon. The only 'religion' was simply observational natural science, and it's interactions with the cosmic bodies of the universe and their energies which they expend as they decay and we consume as we live. But, I digress..

P. S. Consider this: It is not 'Vitamin D' that puts pep back into our step - such a thing does not exist, only symptomatic chemical reactions produced *from* the electrolytic catalysing of solar wavelengths in our body - it is exposure to a little bit of that signal, direct path of the *sun*."|brisbane|2024|True|0

Had to detrain just to move to another train on another platform to sit still on the train for 10+ mins.

My wife works in West end near Coles. She starts early and finishes in the mid afternoon. So far she's been using a combination of Uber and ferries for her commute, but she's grown sick of it and wants to start driving. Problem is finding a place to park. The only cheap one we could find was literally a patch of grass you have to mount the curb to get into, which she can't do in a sedan. She also doesn't want to pay $25 a day because it's cheaper to use uber and ferries. Any suggestions on where to park a sedan all day at a reasonable cost?|brisbane|2024|True|0
"Hi all 
We are considering relocating from Melbourne to Brisbane/sunny coast as we are expecting a baby and my entire extended family is in Brisbane/sunny coast. We’re also sick of the cold plus Melbourne house prices are close to Sydney’s now. 
We are a bit stumped with what construction workers, particularly skilled concrete finishers are paid in qld. Rates seem to vary and online it would appear work is kind of scarce. Melbourne pays very well. We know it’ll be a pay cut to some degree.  
I’m after people’s real life experience working in the brisbane-ish area in construction, as I know, not all work is posted online, it’s sometimes word of mouth.

"I guess it’s applicable to more than just Brisbane, but It’s getting common to hear from both men and women that are sick of using dating apps and that it has ruined dating since covid. And surprisingly I’ve seen more people looking for genuine connections and relationships more than ever.

If there’s a way to meet likeminded people in real life in your area in a casual settings for the purpose of finding real connections, like a party/activities for just lonely and single people meeting friends, would you abandon dating apps for that?"|brisbane|2024|True|0
"## Hello! and welcome back...  

...to another week in live music. It's the end of the financial year and it's quiet out there. Don't fret, pet - there is some good news. Bright lights, big city! There is still enough out there to keep you entertained. Some venues will not and have not let anything get in their way of a good time - leaving their schedules jam-packed from tonight to Sunday.   
  
Fancy that.   
  
As always, I have tried to make sure the information is as accurate and as comprehensive as it can be but do make sure to have a good look at the venue directly before you book. This still serves as only a rough guide.

My wife doesn't have health insurance. She's been complaining of some neurological symptoms for a while and it's getting worse. I suspect an MRI would be requested upon doctor's visit. We can manage doctor's visits and a few lab tests, but we really cann't afford anything expensive like MRI or expensive medications. What are our options?|Indianapolis|2019|True|0
"I have browsed this sub and I know there are a lot of posts about people looking for jobs- this is another one. However, I am also looking for suggestions. 

I have dedicated my whole life to restaurants and bar tending. I grew up in that business and I love what did. I had to quit my job because I have POTS and EDS and the symptoms have become less manageable. Standing and running around for hours is no longer an option. I need to find a job that is mostly sedentary. 

I am currently living off of savings, but I need to find a job that will allow me to keep my current standard of living (>3k a month) and allow me to sit more often than not. I have some office/assistant experience, but like I said before, most of my time was spent in restaurants. 

I also need to stay downtown as I do not drive anymore.  

&#x200B;

I am currently in school for interior design and architecture. So something in that field would be super cool, but probably pretty far fetched.

If anyone has any ideas, I am all ears!"|Indianapolis|2019|True|0
"I am a wild Libertarian from the not-so-wild state of Masshole-landia. I am sick of it here and plan to move to New Hampshire once I get my finances in order.

I am interested in starting a Libertarian homestead in New Hampshire. 10 - 30 acres, probably. Where is the best place to do this?

Any unincorporated areas?

Which areas of NH are the most gun friendly? Homeschool friendly? Least crime? Best homestead community?

How much money would I need to set this up? Best type of loan to take for a homestead?

I want my homestead to be able to support me and 6 family members, going on 7.

How would I go about setting it up? Advice? Personal experience?

I plan to farm plants and animals. Best plants and animals for a beginner? Food animals? Breeding pets to sell? What sort of crop grows best in NH?

How can I make money off my homestead?

Thanks for your help with my De-Masshole-ification."|NewHampshire|2023|True|0
"What are your thoughts on the level of safety and means to report any violations? 

If let's say a co-worker walks by without a mask, coughs in your direction, and you see your boss watch the whole thing and smirk. 

What would you do in that situation? Looking to get some common consensus on the proper way to avoid conflicts as we return to work, with varying levels of concern for the virus.

Edit: thank you for all the feedback. So far it looks like we need to all be prepared for differing opinions in the workplace. Please remember you do have a right to a safe workplace.

"As you all may or may not know, the ""stay home"" in Michigan order does not apply to healthcare workers. Now yea, some employers are decent, but other's like my mom's? Trash. She's a Nurse Manager in a assisted living facility. They literally have had under the bear minimum amount of PPE for ~ 2 months now. 
All the staff keep calling off because they are scared of getting Covid, so my mom always goes in and takes care of some of the residents herself. Two of them had Pneumonia, and they only allow PPE to be used for covid now, so she used a cloth mask she had, but it wasn't enough. 
A couple days later she started spiking a high fever, fatigue, cough, and severe muscle pain -- ALL common symptoms of covid.   She immediately quarantines and gets tested so she doesn't get this high risk population sick. roughly a week later, the test comes back negative and they do a chest x-ray and find pneumonia. 

Now her work is threatening to terminate her because she took time off and it wasn't due to covid after all. What, they wanted her to come in with Pneumonia and a fever of 102 F?  

Anyway, she talked them down from that- but the big deal is that she NEEDS a letter from a doctor or the department of health stating she had  covid symptoms (note: not diagnosed, just symptoms) and thus was required to quarantine for that one week prior to her testing coming back negative for Covid. 

This is really important, because my mom was going to have pre-cancerous breast cells removed early April, but it was cancelled due to the COVID outbreak. Her work states that without a letter stating she had covid-like symptoms and was urged to quarantine, if she chooses to go though with surgery in her reschedule for june to get half her breast taken out, she will be terminated since this technically wasn't covid.

I am SO SO frustrated for her!!! Why do SOMES Employers in Michigan ( and the rest of states too) treat their helathcare workers like trash??? It's because THEY don't have enough PPE that she has Pneumonia. Not only do you refuse to count this as a work related illness, but you'll terminate her if she gets breast surgery due to CANCER? 

Now, I'm a covid case investigator in MA. I'm epidemiology trained and sit in on a lot of employment calls that help people be excused due to covid symptoms here in Mass. It's frustrating I can't help my own mother get a simple later stating she was required to quarantine due to covid potential. Her primary care is out till the 27th of May, The ED she got tested at says they've never been asked for an employee letter. I just want her to be able to get her surgery as soon as possible, but I know she won't risk termination. 

Thanks for listening.

Edited because someone chose to harp on one line in the entire rant that was clearly not the point of the post, but it made them feel big to put me down. *Shrugs*"|Michigan|2020|True|1
I had no choice but to go out and get my meds for my pulled tooth and a few softer food items till I'm healed up. There were at least 10 groups of teens with 3-6 in each group running around the store, buying makeup ect. or 4 teen girls to buy one loaf of bread and a pound of lunch meat. Even had one smart ass teen pretend to cough while him and his buddy were laughing and the 3 girls with them pretending to faint. I understand that the stay at home order sucks, school being cancelled may or may not suck but stay the FUCK home if your just going to go out in groups to Walmart to have fun and goof around. This was in Bad Axe if it matters. So many are making it worse for everyone.|Michigan|2020|True|0
"Is anyone else wrestling with this “not flu,covid, or RSV” virus going around? Sinus infection, headache, body aches, low fever, chest congestion, horrible cough that won’t go away? I was in the walk-in yesterday and literally everyone in the waiting room had it.

"So i’ve received a job offer out of state and have learned that in order to get out of my lease (Pillar Properties property) I will have to cough up $6500, which is 3X my rent plus fees. I can’t sublease it out, they won’t help with getting a new tenant in there in any way or negotiate at all. (They used to let residents give 30-days notice and sublease/find a new tenant. It usually only takes a week or two to replace people here.)

Everywhere i’ve ever lived in the past, if you have to terminate a lease early, they have options that don’t cost thousands upon thousands of dollars. Usually, you’ll just be held responsible for paying your rent until a new tenant is found.

This seems wildly unethical and predatory to me. Is this normal for WA-based property management companies? Do I have any other options? I really don’t want to pay for the cost of moving and also $6500 of almost entirely profit to this greedy, slimy property management company."|seattle|2023|True|0
"My neighbour has three dogs - he’s a nice guy with a daughter who bought dogs then doesn’t want to care for them. It’s sad, they don’t get much stimulation and often get left outside on the 30+ degree days. I’ve spoken to him twice about them cause they go nuts anytime we are outside and during the day and my wife and I largely work at home. Talking about non stop barking all day every day at least once an hour. Often past 10pm too at possums. 

I worry escalating to the council will cause issues, but I’m so sick of their yapping and disrupting our sleep/work/general enjoyment. Plus I want them to be properly looked after and I doubt they are registered with the council.

Anyone had any positive experiences from escalation? "|melbourne|2024|True|0
"There's no way I can possibly cover all the details in a post but basically my ex-partner of 12 years (who has borderline personality disorder) has started using claims of family violence to abuse me and withhold access to our daughter. I'm not even going to try and explain that part, it's just a zero sum game.

I've already filed for court and worked with child protection; the short version is they know she slying but nothing that can legally stop her until parenting orders arrive which is May at the earliest.

In the mean time, I'm finding each day harder and harder. I basically lost my life partner and now potentially my daughter to mental health and I found notes in her room where she's basically confessed to doing it for money. Its like 3 horror films overlapping.

I speak to MensLine and 1800RESPECT and our old couples counsellor on a weekly basis. People still keep telling me to 'look after myself' so I figured I should try and reach out and see if there aren't any specialists who deal with female-on-male abuse. All the services like SafeSteps, Orange Door, etc turn me away because their policy is basically that no woman would ever lie. I think she's just sick, not necessarily trying to lie, but that's besides the point.

"okay so I need help, I currently work at a fish and chip shop and I’ve noticed that no one knows what the general practice is when it comes to grilled fish. I am a super picky eater so the only thing I really know about is chips. When you go to your local fish and chip shop and order a grilled fish do you expect it to be crumbed? My place does grilled fish crumbed unless you specify otherwise.

"Thought I would give an update for those following this story. I am deeply distressed and if anyone has more solutions please let me know.

Quick recap: 
- landlord lives in townhouse next door. New builds 
- moved in over 3 weeks ago
- gorgeous (huge) pointer puppy 
- guy is a hunter 
- dog constantly out the back with no company, crying, distressed, hurling herself against both fences, no toys, no bones, at times she was also out the front, at times her access to water was blocked off, out the front she has no grass or real shelter. Sometimes she is also trapped around the side which is also just paved area 
- she is not being trained from what I’m hearing 
- I’m sick and at home most days listening to her crying and distressed. Often from 7am - 11pm 
- on two occasions we have heard him strike the dog. So hard she yelps 
- he has also bragged about a shock collar and we’ve heard him use it on her 
- I took videos and photos of a lot of above
- I have given her water and pats through the fence many times 

Update: 

- I made contact with the RSPCA and reported him. They came out and were very thorough and helpful. Next door was not home so they got eyes on her from our fence 

- RSPCA call him and he apparently is very nervous. Asking constantly who made the report. Acting paranoid. She did not tell him who made the report and told him there had been several. He then told her the dog has separation anxiety (great that he thinks neglecting and abusing it will assist with this) she’s a god damn puppy!!! She is also a pointer and I’m led to believe they are very active and social dogs

- rspca also visited other neighbour. They are not dog savvy but had been distressed at duration and noise level or crying and dog hurling herself against fence  

- RSPCA told me they were visiting two weeks ago and would offer him free surrender first before going in harder after that. She was supposed to ring me back and let me know what happened. I never heard back from her. I’ve called twice to leave a message 

- after RSPCA called him it was the heatwave weekend and he was scared enough to keep her inside more. To my relief. 

- over this latest weekend he went away. I believe during this time the dog was kept outside for up to 16 hours at a time, if not for 2-3 days straight. I was giving her pats constantly and even some food through the fence. She was howling and crying in distress for hours. This is what occurs most days 

- we have started making noise complaints to the council and keeping a log. They are going to follow up 

- we went last night to knock on his door after we heard her crying from around 7am on and off until 9pm at night. At that stage I had become increasingly more distressed and upset. We told him nicely that we really feel can’t relax hearing her outside and so upset constantly. We can’t go outside or even hand washing out without her crying and hurling herself through the gap in the fence. He became defensive and told us he was eating dinner and when we asked why she was out all weekend he told us that he was away all weekend and the wife can’t handle her on her own. He did not issue an apology and instead told us it was none of our business. He also said they “tell” the dog to be quiet. We told him the dog is not a child and doesn’t understand. She is a puppy and needs attention and love. 

- the council will be issuing a warning about it. I’m most hoping the RSPCA comes to the party too. I just want to get her out!!


For anyone that is going to say that I need to break her out, that is physically impossible. She’s huge. While it is tempting sometimes while she’s out the front with a very short fence, I have nowhere to take her and I don’t want to break any laws.   "|melbourne|2024|True|0
"I'm sure everyone is sick of these posts so apologises in advance. 

We finished our lease up on 5th of March and handed in the keys. 

We waited to be notified about a date and time for a final inspection which never came. From what I've read, REA must do this inspection within 10 days and give us reasonable opportunity to be at the property during inspection. Although I haven't been able to find consequences for REA if they don't comply. 

After giving them 11 days to notify us about final inspection we got sick of waiting and filed to get our bond back directly from the RTBA. 

Now today 18th March they've emailed us saying they've partly completed the inspection and will fully complete it tomorrow with the owners. Obviously they haven't provided us with the opportunity to be there for either inspection and they have completed in the windows they were meant to. 

Of course they've found things they want to use to dispute our bond and are saying landlord will probably list more tomorrow. Currently they are mentioning 6x blown light bulbs and 1 ripped lace curtain. 

Is this worth taking to VCAT? Is there any consequences for REA for not following the rules in regards to the final inspection?

"I’m sorry, but for fucks sake. 

It’s after midnight. The lines are dead. I’ve just finished work, and I only want to go home.

I was late today to work because a tram issue meant I missed the train I normally get (I get the train BEFORE the one that WOULD get me to work on time, as this train is consistently so late beyond its timetabled time, that it makes me late to work). 

I’m looking at a sign on the opposite platform saying that the train punctuality is 92.12%. I can’t see the small print, but what bullshit allowances/tolerances is this based on? Is my train the one 7.88% outlier, cause the cunting thing is late every fucking day?

I’m actually so fucking sick of being late to work; spending hours getting dicked around on *horrendously* organised bus replacement services that triple my already long commute time; getting home late due to inexplicably delayed trains; being treated like a fucking criminal by Authorised Bullies. 

I actually wrote a complaint to Metro after I was yelled at by an AO that I was not even engaging or speaking to; it was horrendously unprofessional, and actually embarrassing, as it happened in front of a huge queue of similarly unfortunate folk waiting for the fabled bus replacement service. Their reply was, of course: go fuck yourself. 

I understand the city circle is an antiquated rail design, and at rush hour the consequence is blocks backing up and trains sitting waiting for traffic to clear. That’s fine. They are trying to address it with more lines and adapting the city loop. It’s part of an exponentially growing population, which is also the reason I am getting fist fucked to death on rent and struggling to get to the point where I can one day buy.. but that’s a different post for a different day. 

Why am I standing with my dick in my hand at this hour, the only person on a platform, waiting for a fucking train?

Sure, it’s the weekend, but this bullshit happens mid week also. Consistently. The lateness of the train is so reliable, that I don’t even rush when I’ve been delayed getting out work to catch my usual train; I know it won’t fucking be there. 

I have put off getting a car because driving in Melbourne is a ballache and stressful, and if I can make my own (admittedly insignificant and ultimately pointless..) contribution to not fist fucking the planet to death, then that’s a good thing. 

But, fuck me, just give me a train that gets from A to B on time. 

Anyway, sorry for the enraged rant. I’m just tired with work; lack of sleep; and fucking around on PTV.

A nasty parasitic infection causing gastro-like symptoms has hospitalised multiple people and seen pools closed across Melbourne.

Cases of cryptosporidiosis have been on the rise since spring last year, but the latest outbreak has seen two pools at the Northcote Aquatic and Recreation Centre temporarily closed for hyperchlorination following cases linked to the facility’s learn-to-swim pool.

There have been 440 cryptosporidiosis cases detected in Victoria so far this year, an increase of more than fivefold from the same time in 2023.

Detected cases over the past 12 months, at 1074, are the highest levels since 2017.

The infection is a type of gastroenteritis caused by parasites which are highly resistant to the levels of chlorine normally found in pools. It typically causes watery diarrhoea and stomach cramps which may last several weeks.

“Other symptoms may include fever, nausea, vomiting, bloating and loss of appetite. Less commonly, cryptosporidium infection can present as pneumonia, cholecystitis or pancreatitis,” Victorian chief health officer Dr Clare Looker warned in December.

Over the warmer months, several Victorians have been hospitalised with the illness, including a woman in her mid-30s who believes she recently caught the disease at her local pool in Melbourne’s inner north.

The woman, who asked not to be named to disclose details of her sickness, developed heartburn, nausea, dry eyes, bloating, followed by stomach cramps and severe diarrhoea.

“I’m immunosuppressed with an underlying autoimmune condition, and my doctor grew concerned when I became weak and confused from dehydration,” she said.

“Four days into the illness, I turned up to the hospital emergency room and was admitted overnight to a ward. I was given three bags of IV fluids and antibiotics, and asked to take stool and blood tests.

“I’m out of hospital now but crypto is one of the nastiest illnesses I’ve had. My back and joints still aren’t right. A week into the illness and I’ve still got a dodgy tummy, despite antibiotics.”

On Tuesday evening, the Northcote Aquatic and Recreation Centre advised via its Facebook page that it would be temporarily closing the 25- and 50-metre pools at the centre as a “precautionary measure” after an outbreak in the learn-to-swim pool. It was expected to reopen on Wednesday morning.

The children’s pool has already undergone hyperchlorination, “meaning lessons in this pool will not be impacted and will go ahead as normal,” the statement said.

Last week, the North Eastern Public Health Unit confirmed it was working with the Health Department and local councils to investigate a higher-than-usual number of people with cryptosporidiosis across its region.

“The investigation has found that several people with cryptosporidiosis attended public swimming pools whilst others had no links to swimming pools, or had multiple risk factors such as farm animal contact,” a unit spokesperson said.

“Cryptosporidiosis can be transmitted in many ways, including from contaminated food and water as well as contaminated swimming pool water.

“Cryptosporidiosis can be transmitted from person to person or from animal to person.”

They confirmed a small number of people had been admitted to hospital.

### How to avoid cryptosporidiosis

* Shower and wash with soap, especially your bottom, before swimming.
* Wash your hands with soap after going to the toilet or changing a nappy.
* Change nappies in nappy change areas only.
* Avoid swallowing pool water.
* Do not swim if you have diarrhoea or have had diarrhoea in the past two weeks

"This has been my past week:

10-month-old couldn't keep food down, and had raging diarrhea. Didn't think much of it until he seemed super lethargic and had a high temperature. 

Three days later, 4 year old out of no where starts bringing up entire meals. Just can't keep it down. Fever for three days. Can barely function. Her diet was dry toast and water and electrolyte icey poles for three days per doctor request. 

Last night I wake up feeling... strange. Only way I can put it. Like an entire body pain. Extremely uncomfortable. Almost like back pain but not. I get up to take a piss and find my legs can barely keep me up. I haven't felt like this since I got a stomach bug in Bali. 

I slept right through to midday, and again from 1pm-6pm. I'm better now but temperature is still 39. I could sleep another 20 hours I reckon. Zero other symptoms except lethargic and some slight stomach upsetness. 

Meanwhile, I get a call from my mum who asks if we're sick. Both of my parents are riddled with the same symptoms after having looked after my daughter.

THEN today I get an alert from my daughter's school that there's been a case of gastro in one of the rooms. Not sure if that's what we have, I've had gastro before and there was more vomiting, but seems with the new school year there are lots of very nasty bugs around. I honestly can't remember ever feeling this weak or unwell.

If you have kids in school I'd recommend have electrolytes and cracked available because it hit my household very suddenly and there's zero chance I'd have been able to go anywhere to get anything. Even calling into work was very tough.

"Hey.

I need some help.

I've suffered from depression / anxiety for over 10 years now.  I struggle with addiction to drugs, video games and porn.  I work a somewhat stable job, but I've hit the 9-month mark I usually hit with anything I've done in life where I just give up.  

It sounds stupid, but I've always felt like I wish I was more sick / on harder drugs so that I would get taken seriously.  I feel like I need a psych ward or rehab, but I'm just not /that/ bad.  The thing is, I feel like I'm going to get much worse if I don't take action now.

Some details:
28yo man, living in Melbourne (near CBD), been on Lexapro for the last 10 years, ADHD stimulants for the past 5 years or so, finished VCE but never stuck with studies, no clear career goals, no real hobbies other than gaming (and even then, I'm not good at it nor do I have strong social connections from it), constantly cycling through my substance abuse which is mostly with weed but often other things.

I spoke to psych triage but I clearly wasn't bad enough.  I've called Odyssey House but they didn't get back to me.  My GP is useless apart from scripts.  

I want some form of support group at the very least.

If this isn't the right place, please tell me where to post this.

"Hello. I'm a 27-year-old man and my current psychiatrist has diagnosed me with ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome (AS).

As with most psychiatry diagnoses, these diagnoses are very prone to confirmation bias. The lack of gold standard diagnostic tests also means that there is a wide range of inter-observer variability (hence, I've had several differing diagnoses throughout the years, including social anxiety, major depression, dysthymia, personality disorder).

&#x200B;

I do not mean to sound very cocky or arrogant. However, I would like to state from the outset that I am not a textbook case of ADHD or AS. I've been fortunate enough to be intellectually gifted and was able to float through high school and university without much effort or studying. However, since my professional field requires hard work (especially in the form of research and memorising lists of random facts) rather than simply relying on one's intelligence and problem solving skills (such as in mathematics and physics), I've been struggling a bit recently.

&#x200B;

Nonetheless, I think my greatest weakness is in communication skills and social relationships. I usually do not have any awkward quirks that would make other's think that I'm on the autistic spectrum.

The following list are some of my shortcomings:

* I lack eye contact (mostly because I lack self-confidence and find it hard know how long is too long)
* I talk in a monotone manner or otherwise too enthusiastically (especially if it is a subject I'm passionate about)
* I think in concrete terms and lack quite a lot of emotional ties
* I sometimes have inappropriate emotional responses (eg. laughing at inappropriate times because I've made a random, esoteric connection in my head)
* I often appear very anxious, serious or ""spaced out"" (because I'm not expressing any emotion to avoid having inappropriate emotional response and I rarely make jokes with people I'm not very familiar with ?social anxiety)
* I have always had trouble making friends and getting romantic partners (often not know what to say, they seem to have fun whilst I interact with them but they never seek me out afterwards, outside of class/work, etc.)

I haven't had any friends for the last 5 years and my family doesn't talk to me, so it very difficult to differentiate how much of these symptoms are from social isolation/anxiety, lack of experience, ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome.

I would like to think that I have a great insight about myself but the main problem is that I do not know how to fix them.

&#x200B;

Can anybody recommend any good psychologists who can help me improve my social skills?

I know that one can simply go and search up psychologists  (Find a psychologist through APS).

However, I was wanting to hear people's personal experiences with them.

How helpful were they?

How long have you been seeing them and how often (once a week/fortnight, etc.)?

Are they reasonably priced?

&#x200B;

I live in the Southeast suburbs (around Oakleigh/Chadstone Shopping Centre) so any psychologists around that area would be preferred. However, I'm also willing to go to the CBD as well.

Since I work a full-time job, after-hours or weekend sessions are a major plus!

&#x200B;

If you feel uncomfortable posting publicly below, feel free to private message me.

Feel free to recommend yourself  if you are a good psychologist in this area.

"I dont think we are ready to open businesses yet and have been very upfront about that. But I also think it's only fair to hear what those business owners have to say on the matter.

***Note: I am not even touching on ethical employment considerations here, just the simple daily measures needed to keep the virus from spreading.***

So in all sincerity, I ask:

1) How will you ensure a distance of 13 feet between people (employees/vendors/customers) during business hours? *Studies show that this virus travels an average of 13 feet, much more than the 6 feet originally thought (back when we didnt know anything about this virus).*

2) Will you provide protective gear (face masks, etc) for your employees? *After all, not everyone can sew and if hospitals are having a difficult time acquiring them, it is probably impossible for the average person to obtain anything. If people use homemade items there is no way to ensure effectiveness.*

3) Will you require all customers/vendors entering the premises to wear protective gear in order to protect your employees?

4) Will you keep detailed records of every person that enters the facility so that contact tracing can be successful in the case of an outbreak centered at your business?

5) How will you maintain your facility's HVAC system in order to prevent aerosolized droplets from spreading through heat or ac?

6) How will you ensure the facility is properly disinfected on a daily basis or in between customers? *It is almost impossible to obtain CDC approved disinfectant right now so I am interested in knowing if you already have CDC approved products or a way to get them.*

7) How often will floors be disinfected? *We know that droplets fall to the floor, attach to shoes, and can be tracked around.*

8) How will you handle mail and packages that arrive at your business? 

9) What will you do if an employee suddenly has a coughing fit in the middle of a populated area, even if they have no fever?

10) If you learn that an employee, customer, or vendor tests positive, what will you do? Will you close the facility and decontaminate the building? Will you immediately notify the authorities? Will you inform the other employees/customers/vendors?"|NewHampshire|2020|True|0

"Severely pissed off right now. I've been back and forth with NBN co and Belong for five months now about getting NBN connected in my apartment. For the meantime I have been using a 50 GB/month 4G Telstra AirCard provided by work to work from home on.

The units on either side of me already have NBN connected so it should be easy right? Wrong, turns out NBN co don't want to use the existing ducting to feed the cable through, and want to drill through the roof instead. Body corporate doesn't trust them to waterproof properly, I don't trust them either, so we are at an impasse. I am sick of receiving calls from their call center in India about absolutely nothing while I'm eating dinner and having my food go cold, so I thought to cancel the NBN order and request ADSL like the stupid Kiwi immigrant I am. They just told me that they have cancelled the order and no ISP can connect ADSL in an NBN-ready area, and advised me to look at Telstra for a wireless mobile plan.

Wonderful thing is, it also seems from a quick search that there are no providers here with anything more than 100 GB per month in mobile data. I will only be in this place for 6 more months so I don't mind paying quite a bit as long as I can get something close to ""unlimited"". My mobile provider is Boost and my renewal is up soon so I will be grabbing whatever gives me the most GB per month, but I would really like some semblance of a stable internet connection where I can watch movies etc.

TL;DR: Can't get wired internet, got 6 months left on my lease, want to be able to watch things and play games ASAP while in lockdown. Any good suggestions?"|melbourne|2020|True|0
"Hey Guys (mates?), 

American here (I know, I know...). My wife and I are very seriously considering moving out of country and Australia is a place that I think we would love. I want to get a very real and honest opinion from you guys on if you like living in Melbourne. From what I’ve been reading you guys love a lot of the stuff that I love: Coffee, Meat, Music (KG&LW is top 5 for me), the Outdoors and Interior/Architectural Design. 

I’m in Real Estate and would want to stay in that field. Haven’t read a lot about the RE market in Melbourne so any insight would be great!

Thanks for any input here. To be frank I’m just sick of where USA is headed and a break would be much needed.

Edit: this would not be an immediate move. Would be post Covid and likely beyond before we started getting really serious.

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the input on visas and difficulty of acquiring them. I will definitely do a lot more research on this!"|melbourne|2020|True|0
"I’m currently renting a 1 bedroom apartment around South Yarra/Malvern area as a student, however  about 2 months ago I headed back to NSW to take care of a sick grandparent and will now be studying online from there. Since I can’t justify the rental any more  and can’t get down in person I need all of my belongings packed up and put in to storage. However I’m not sure if it will even be worth holding onto things like furniture if I can’t give back for 6-12 months to sell/bin things. 

Can anyone give me advice on what to do or who to go through?
My plan right now is to find a removalist who can clear the place, unload it all into a storage facility, and one day head back down and sell most of whats there on gum tree (for $ or free)  I’m a bit worried that its going to cost more to store my furniture than it’s worth keeping to sell, so maybe i should donate it, or give away the stuff, or send it to the dump... but I don’t know how I could organise that with any particular service?

Ive got 2nd hand furniture (maybe $600 between table, desk,  3 seat couch, KS bed, coffee table, chair, 3 medium side tables, and office chair, a few other medium items), a washer and fridge that cost $100 together but doubt ill get much cash back for them, and then some cooking wear and clothes that I don’t want to lose, and finally a good quality mountain bike which I don’t want stolen or tossed.

Should I just bin the furniture if this is the case? I don’t even know if Ill be living in Melbourne for a few years,or at all, if I start working in NSW after my study ends - the only use would be to sell it later."|melbourne|2020|True|0
"So without naming the company, I work at a very large Warehouse for a large company which I believe shouldnt really be considered ""Essential"" but for whatever reason the stores remain open and people continue to flock their and shop.
Anyway a few people have been sick lately and while they take the test the rest of us continue to work and wait on their results.
I feel as though waiting for a positive result before closing down is irresponsible of the company becuase we have around 200 people working here on dayshift and 150+ working arvo with around 40-50 Casuals not on site at any given time.

That means if we were to have an outbreak here we potentially could have 300-400 people with the virus all take it home to their friends/family and a cluster of thousands would follow.

"Hi folks.

I'm a 34 yo guy with a Bachelor of Music--graduated 2009--and ten years in the work force. I'm at somewhat of a crossroads in my life; really sick of the work I've been doing (finance/project stuff) and ready for a big career change. Into what, I'm not 100% sure! But at this stage I'm pretty confident it'll be in the sciences. So...

I'm looking at heading back to Uni for a Bachelor of Science, there to explore various fields and work out what really enthuses me as a specialisation. Then I can explore postgrad options with more direction and fundamental knowledge under my belt.

Has anyone done something similar to this? That is, gone back to a broad based uni degree, as a mature age student, without knowing exactly what you're wanting to specialise in? Was it worth doing? Did you end up finding a niche and pursuing that through to post-grad? Was there any barriers to enrollment that you needed to navigate? And how was your experience as a MAS amongst young pups?

And for general folks, do you think this is a good idea? Am I crazy even considering it?

Any constructive advice would be greatly appreciated! :)

*Edit: Thanks so much for the advice and comments thus far! Just for some context, I'm without a family, and fairly financially stable; I live quite cheaply, by mainstream standards. I'm certainly not scared of even a significant drop in salary, far more scary is the prospect of spending my short time here doing something that doesn't excite me. Hell, I'd busk before I went back to finance at this stage, which is really saying something post-COVID!*

"My partner is a teacher in the public system, and got told this today:

They have to be at school every day during the upcoming term, even with remote teaching, because they need to rotate teachers watching the kids of doctors/nurses/those sick with the virus.

My question is - why? Seems kinda bullshit to expose all teachers to this virus, with no PPE provided by the schools, no training given, just so the economy can tick on.

Daniel Andrews can provide millions in emergency funding for victims of domestic violence (which is fantastic!), millions for small businesses, millions in overtime for cops, but teachers can't get PPE/training, nor can they fund specialists to actually do that work. Instead, my partner has to risk their life because of this nonsense?

What the fuck? Why can't they remote teach from home like last term?

>**MASK ORDER WAS OBEYED IN CITY BY 95 PER CENT**

>...Every sort of mask could be seen on the streets yesterday.  Men cautiously permitted their masks to dangle from one ear while they smoked.  After a few trials at eating with the mask on, masks were permanently discarded in restaurants by diners, although the waiters clung to them religiously.

>...

>No arrests were made yesterday of the very few violators of the influenza mask order.  There might have been some who did not know of the new rule until they reached the downtown section, the officials said, and therefore the first day went by without arrests.

>But beginning this morning, all violators of the mask order will be arrested, City Manager Thompson said last night.  There will be no exceptions, it was insisted.  Every person who appears on the street must be wearing a mask.

>The police department will cooperate with the citizens' committee today in making the wearing of masks compulsory.  It was announced that the penalty for violation of this order will be $100 fine or 30 days' imprisonment, or both.

Page 2 of the same issue has an anti-mask ad from E.S. Wakelin Grocery Co., a place I definitely will not shop at now. I won't quote their questionable statement except the closing that I'm not sure even the most vehement mask-denier would agree with today: ""The only mask that is antidotal to disease, is the mask of good cheer.""

I assume masks were made mandatory after the notice posted about a week prior wasn't effective. [Page 8 (again, the last page) of November 20, 1918](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/digital/collection/sn84020558/id/104116/rec/12):

"I have lived here 23 years and more than a lot of places Denver's ""courteous"" drivers love to line up. I don't understand why we can't grasp that when a lane is closed a mile or two away and you see those arrows telling you to get over, please do not do it immediately.

Stay the course! Your lane is just fine and you don't have to do anything until it ends. You go all the way down to the cones and use that courtesy to follow a left right zipper procedure, and we make traffic better! Currently Denver lines up after getting over immediately, even to the point of stopping in the middle of the lane to merge over a thousand yards from the cones. Meanwhile traffic backs up through lights for miles!

Today the left lane on Alameda headed east from Santa Fe was closed and I was in the still open lane. Traffic was moving slowly but moving and someone essentially stopped to the left of me trying to merge. I felt like I would be an asshole to not let them in but then I realized how much he was a symptom of the problem. He forced his way in and now all of us were stuck in a gridlock with his ass hanging out in the left lane. Once we started moving I decided to really be the asshole and do the right thing so I got in the left lane and went all the way up to the front and politely zipper merged. As I looked in my rear view that snag was still keeping people stuck at the light at Santa Fe with a completely wide open left lane all the way up to the merge point.

How do we change Denver to alleviate this problem that causes the traffic everyone thinks is so bad? This one issue would cut traffic in construction zones in half."|Denver|2020|True|0
"Happy Labor Day! Hope everyone is staying safe and well, especially with everything going on in the mountains and front range right now. I know this is the first time I have ever experienced wildfires like this (let alone wildfires plus a snowstorm - like what??), so I wanted to share a little educational post for anyone else who may be in the same boat or who may just want to learn more about what's going on. My hope is to NOT cause alarm by sharing this, but help increase understanding so we all know better what's going on. Knowing more about wildfires has definitely made me feel better, especially in regard to knowing what I can do to stay safe. If there is any additional information I can add to this or anything I should change, please let me know!

\**Disclaimer*: This post is not meant to override anything a public official/health professional has told you. This post is only intended to provide general information for educational purposes.\*

**Some quick facts about the Cameron Peak fire:**

1. The Cameron Peak fire has burned through 89,000 acres in the mountains west of Fort Collins, more than tripling in size over the Labor Day weekend.
2. The fires have also reached the north-western front of Rocky Mountain National Park.
3. Ash can be seen falling as far as 60 miles south in Denver.
4. The fire is listed at 4% containment as of Monday morning with 795 personnel assigned to fight the fire.
5. The Cameron Peak fire is now listed as the 4th largest fire in CO history.

Even if your miles away from a wildfire you can still experience side effects from the smoke, especially if you're an older adult, pregnant woman, child, or individual with with preexisting respiratory conditions. **Common side effects from smoke inhalation may include** (but are not limited to):

* Coughing
* Trouble breathing normally
* Stinging eyes
* A scratchy throat
* Runny nose
* Irritated sinuses
* Wheezing and shortness of breath
* Chest pain
* Headaches
* An asthma attack
* Tiredness
* Fast heartbeat

If you're worried about smoke inhalation or have been experiencing any side effects from it, **here are a few tips that may help prevent/reduce smoke inhalation and/or its side effects**:

1. Stay updated with public officials, the local air quality reports and the US Air Quality Index ([https://www.airnow.gov/](https://www.airnow.gov/)).
2. If possible, work indoors or limit outdoor exposure.
3. Keep your windows and doors closed if you can. Use the air recirculation option in vehicles.
4. Avoid strenuous activity and outdoor exercise.
5. If you use an AC, keep the fresh-air intake closed and ensure the filter is clean. Also use an air purifier if you have one.
6. Avoid burning candles or lighting a fire in a fireplace/wood-burning stove.
7. Increase fluid intake to the extent your personal health allows.
8. Wear a mask when possible, especially when outside, to help protect your lungs from smoke.
9. Use over-the-counter natural tears or eye drops for burning/watery eyes.
10. Use an air humidifier if you have one.
11. *Important*: if your symptoms persist or get worse, consult a medical professional.

COVID-19 and smoke exposure may share some of the same side effects, so if you have any concerns you can always use this **online-checker from the CDC** ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)) to help determine whether you need further assessment.

Thankfully, **the snowstorm expected to start tonight will help reduce the fire and smoke pollution**, but most likely will not put it out completely. Some smoke conditions are expected to persist after the storm. In the Denver area, conditions tonight/tomorrow will include (**weather advisory**):

1. 60-degree drop in temperature from Monday into Tuesday
2. High of 35 degrees/low of 29 degrees Tuesday/Wednesday
3. Strong winds with cold fronts, as well as rain and snow starting Monday evening
4. Significant snow accumulation in the Front Range Mountains/Foothills and slushy, wet snowfall in the Denver metro area and 1-25 Corridor (expected to be 8 to 14 inches)
5. Possible Impacts: power outages, broken tree limbs, slush/snow on roads in mountains

\***Important:** if there is ash on your car, try to wipe it off or get your car covered since the mix of ash and snow can cause damage to the car paint\*

**Driving conditions will not be great**, so avoid going out on the roads if you can. If you are out driving, remember to take it slow with no sudden movements or braking. If you have ever lived in the south, we have a fun saying for driving in snowy conditions:

>J*ust pretend you're taking grandma to church. There's a platter of biscuits and two gallons of sweet tea in glass jars in the back seat. She's wearing a new dress and holding a crock pot full of gravy.*

Hope this helps! If you have any further questions, please feel free to comment or message me directly. I know understanding more of what's going on made me feel better, so I hope it does the same for you. Much love to everyone. Let's all stay safe out there!!

Edit: change your household filters in the next week or so. It is going to get hot again and your ac needs good airflow to work properly otherwise it will freeze up and possibly break (thank you /u/mikewheels

Cognitive  testing of nearly 113,000 people in England found that those with  persistent post-Covid symptoms scored the equivalent of 6 I.Q. points  lower than people who had never been infected with the coronavirus,  according to the study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal  of Medicine.

People who had been  infected and no longer had symptoms also scored slightly lower than  people who had never been infected, by the equivalent of 3 I.Q. points,  even if they were ill for only a short time.

The  differences in cognitive scores were relatively small, and neurological  experts cautioned that the results did not imply that being infected  with the coronavirus or developing long Covid caused profound deficits  in thinking and function. But the experts said the findings are  important because they provide numerical evidence for the brain fog,  focus and memory problems that afflict many people with long Covid.>>  \[If this article is behind a paywall, do a Google search for the article and it may be possible to avoid the paywall when clicking on the search result.\]

"Rule 1.

It seems that with the recent resurgence in COVID cases, we've seen just as strong a resurgence in misinformation showing up in the comments here. So, inspired by our friends in /r/Phoenix, we are posting this as a friendly reminder to everyone.

We encourage posts, comments, and discussion about COVID and other current events, so long as it is relevant to the New Orleans area. Spreading misinformation related to COVID, vaccines, and quite frankly anything else, however, is not acceptable, and doing so will earn you a permanent ban from the subreddit. Our tolerance for this is pretty much zero at this point. This includes misrepresenting factual information to craft false narratives.

Here are some examples of what is not allowed, all of which are direct quotes from comments. 

""The vaccine isn't safe, over 6000 people have died after receiving it""

""Kids get sicker from the flu than covid! It is proven unsafe for kids to wear masks!""

""Vaccinated are getting sick as well and spreading it worse than the unvaccinated...""

""Masks obviously don't work. The harm they cause far outweighs any generic 'feel good' representation of wearing them.""

""Only an idiot would try and protect children, who are immune from an imaginary virus.""

Our stance as a subreddit is to follow science, facts, and public health guidance: COVID is real, and vaccines are safe and effective. If you're looking for more details, here are a few resources with tons of useful information:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html

Furthermore, it is a new sub rule that discussion on political and controversial subjects is only permitted from active sub members. This includes COVID. This means if you've never posted or commented here before, and show up just to argue with or attack other users, your comments will be removed.

If you see any misinformation or content that otherwise violates our subreddit rules, please help us out and report it so we can address it.



Rule 2.

Because of how heated political posts, topics and discussions sometimes get, there are some extra rules around them for /r/NewOrleans:


 Posts on political news, controversial topics and thoughts are welcome any time from active sub members.


 Political/controversial posts by people who do not otherwise contribute to this sub are not permitted. This sub is for its members to discuss the topics they choose.


 Spam rules apply to these posts just like any other. If someone is only coming here to only drop political links, that's still spam. Stay and have a discussion if the topic is important.


 Different opinions are welcome, but you need to be civil about it. We will not remove controversial opinions as long as everyone is being respectful. Different opinions does NOT mean false information.


 Posts promoting specific political candidates or propositions are not permitted. These threads often turn into fights, or at best come across as promotion/spam.


 For major elections we will make a pinned election-level post a week or two in advance and link voting information. We will try to gather all general information about all candidates in there also.



If anyone has any thoughts about these new rules or would like to make a change to them, please post below. We are making these rules due to the intense brigading and massive amounts of misinformation lately. It's been soo bad that reddit admins actually got involved and helped us. We like to think that our evidence led to the quarantine of a certain sub. It's probably a coincidence...but it's fun to dream."|NewOrleans|2021|True|0
"Aloha kākou!

I am a student at Leeward CC and my group's final project is about potholes in this state. It is well known that Hawaii ranks low for road quality when compared to the rest of the states, and it has ranked low for many years. For instance, according to the Federal Highway Administration, drivers spend an average of 764 dollars per year in damages related to poor road quality, which is way more than the average person in the states.

There is a [website](https://www.honolulu.gov/115-main-site/main-hot-links-cat/79-report-a-pothole.html) where you can report potholes, and I'm curious how many people know about this site or use it. I'm aware that the government here isn't known for its speedy construction of public infrastructure (cough cough *Hart),* but it still would be interesting to see. The form for this is [here.](https://forms.gle/qTEZbicYycLuLZqC7)

In addition, tell me where your ""favorite"" potholes are! I'll go and find them and take some photos.

Mahalo for any participation!"|Hawaii|2023|True|0
Multiple friends of mine have gotten sick from Paradise Park lately. And no, it's not that they drank too much and got hungover. Never having been a fan myself, I can't taste the difference, but they claim the batches have been 'off.' Anyone else encountered this phenomenon? By sick I mean headaches and/or throwing up.|NewOrleans|2019|True|0
"Yesterday, I went out and brought the homeless meals for Thanksgiving. It really humbled me. I hope today that you a truely grateful for the things you have in your life. I mean just the basic things. You still have the ability to walk, talk and have use of all your faculties. 
 Most of you have a car, or the basic ability to get from place to place quickly. A cell phone,  an almost immediate way to get in touch with your loved ones. You’re sick, you make a call to your Doctor. You pay your bill at the Dr office because you have insurance. You have the ability to work, pay your bills and have some extra to go out to eat. Go to fun events, like Christmas in the oaks. 
Yesterday I met a girl named Pearl. She has no job, she moved here for work and the job fell through. She has no ID because she doesn’t have a place to live. She is continuously on the move. The police will randomly come through and take her tent, food and all belongings. They arrest anyone and for any reason, if you can’t move fast enough. There are many people that don’t move, because they are too sick and don’t have a way to the hospital. She has no way to make money, Most jobs require an ID. She could make money as a prostitute which she is unwilling to do. She can’t get into a shelter, women with children are a priority. Even if the  children are in another state and are well taken care of. Pearl has no family and told me she keeps hoping that someone will come and adopt her. I gave her some food, she told me of the street fighting. Some people will put in a pool of food and fight over it. She said sometimes it really makes her start to feel like an animal. The kicker that literally brought me to tears. When I went to give her silverware. She said for me not to worry about it because she was used to eating with her hands. Never in my life have I thought to even be grateful for silverware. 
So next time you get mad because you got a flat tire, get stuck in traffic. Your cellphone stops working. You had a bad day at work. You get upset that the grocery store is busy. 
Think of Pearl and the homeless and how much more you have than them and be very grateful for what you do have. 
I also hope that this encourages you to have compassion and be kind and help those less fortunate than you."|NewOrleans|2019|True|0
"One of our very own redditors, /u/kandyhoe29, is having a hard time and needs some help keeping herself and her adorable tiny human off the streets. I met her tonight. She is a real human. In fact, she's a nice young lady who got sick and fell behind on bills, just as her landlord decided to renovate the house she's renting.

Anyway,  I know we're all a bunch of curmudgeonly bastards who cheer on car flips and downvote on a whim, but I've met many of you and I've often been impressed by the generosity of people on this subreddit. Also, the memes. The memes are...very good.

This is a tough, tough city to be poor in, so throw a few dollars at two people who need some help! It will make you feel good and, you know, I'll think you're aight and stuff. Plus, I've met a lot of you, so I know how much you spend on pomegranate kombucha and hand-roasted coffee. Hell, I spent $13 on fried chicken today.

I have a bunch of boy and girl baby stuff from when my kids were younger I’m looking to donate. Lots of clothes and toys for < 24 month olds plus some other associated carriers, blankets, baby gates, etc. I’ve tried giving them away or selling them for extremely cheap on Facebook and Nextdoor but that is way too much of a headache. I’d like to find a place that I can just drop all this stuff off at to donate.

"Will you please share your experiences with canine influenza? Our Rottweiler is 9, we've had her 7 of those years, she's had all of her shots, and has never been sick. About a week ago she started acting a little lazier than usual, but nothing concerning. We were getting ready to travel to California for my son's wedding, and the night before we flew out she was extremely lethargic, would only drink water and had zero interest in food. She was still going out to potty, etc. Our daughters pet sitter kept a close eye on her, kept her hydrated, but none of us really knew what was going on. Once we got back from the wedding, I had more time to observe her, and she checked every box for the canine influenza. We live in a gated community, and practically everyone has a dog, it's very clean here, but that doesn't mean viruses don't circulate. I've read that it can last up to 3 weeks, and live on surfaces for 48 hours, she's responding well to the children's Robitussin honey DM, she has started to pose interest in food but still won't eat solids. I purchased a medicine syringe, and I'm giving her doses of chicken bone broth and unrefined coconut oil. She is drinking water, and a lot of it. She's looking better by the day, but this would be the entry of week 2 so I know there's more to come. I've never had a dog get the flu before so I'm needing to hear from others who have, and how you handled it.

"This is a pill you take **after** you've gotten covid. You're supposed to start taking it as soon as possible -- within five days of onset of symptoms.

My GP's first take was that it wasn't available in Wichita. When advised that Walmart had it in stock (Dillons did not), their second take was that it was really expensive. Not true - Walmart dispenses it for free as long as you have a prescription.

There are some limitations - age, weight, pregnancy or having a new-born and is contraindicated with certain drugs. It has not been approved by the FDA but has been granted an Emergency Use Authorization. 

Studies have shown an approximate 90% reduction in covid-related hospitalizations.

It has some side effects -- most notably, it messes with your taste buds."|Wichita|2022|True|0
"Hello,

I am currently helping a new international student that is from my home country. He says he was under treatment for panic, anxiety and depressive disorders back home(he showed me his prescriptions from 3 years ago) but stopped taking the meds after 5 to 6 months because they were making him lethargic. After coming to the US he has been facing a lot of issues with his anxiety and depression, and I think he is showing many symptoms of depression. He has trouble getting out of bed and going to class and he says he has not been doing well in class anyways because he has trouble being motivated or paying attention.

I have referred him to the campus counselling services but he missed his appointment with a counselor this morning saying he wants to go to a ""real doctor"". I am not sure how to connect him to a ""real doctor"" since I am not well acquainted with the medical system in the U.S, being an international student myself. I would really appreciate some advice as to how to guide him next so he can get the help he needs.

Thank you."|Wichita|2022|True|0

# TODAY'S UPDATES

**7 new cases recorded today from 2,646 tests. Of these:**

* All are linked
   * 6 are household contacts
* Only 2 in quarantine. At least 4 in the community for part, 1 under investigation
* None are linked to the identified public sites of transmission

**Other details:**

* 5 in hospital, 2 in ICU, with 1 requiring ventilation
   * Age range: 18-70s
* 12+ can book Pfizer appointments from today
* Current advice from Commonwealth is that we will not see Pfizer supply reduced between Sept-Oct, contrary to prior indications
* However, we will not be seeing the previously projected increase of Pfizer to government clinics. Pfizer supply will be focussed on GPs and Moderna to pharmacists
* Note that Vic and NSW both received increased vaccine supply during their outbreaks. Barr's view is that ACT should not be treated any differently
* Today we will reach 80% of 12+ with first dose of vaccine
* 55% of 12+ have been fully vaxxed
* Priority over next 6 weeks to get as many people back to work as safely as possible
* Prioritising more outdoor activity in the coming weeks
* Clear modelling advice is that it is prudent to wait until reaching 80% double dose before easing restrictions
* Obligations to eachother don't end when we are fully vaccinated - you can still get and transmit the virus when fully vaxxed
* Community and business compliance will also be considered WRT easing restrictions
* Also very focussed on health system capacity + implications of cross-border demand on our health system from regional NSW. Both NSW and VIC premiers have been clear that they expect ""extreme pressure"" on their health systems
* Barr has provided more info about phased restriction easing, noting that restrictions will remain if we see increases in cases:
   * Gathering sizes will be increased
   * Density requirements in businesses with caps on the total number allowed
   * Highest risk businesses will remain closed or tightly restricted for longer
   * Gradual return to offices
   * Phased return face-to-face learning
   * Updated mental health package to be announced tomorrow
* Total outbreak cases: 625
* Total recovered: 401
* No new public sites of transmission have been identified
* A detailed roadmap (like what Victoria has released over the weekend) will not be released by ACT yet, as there is not enough certainty around dates, vaxx numbers etc.

It's the question which has played on the minds of plenty of Canberrans in the past month: when is the best time to duck out for those essentials?

One mistimed supermarket run and you could find yourself needing to get a COVID test, in isolation or worse: picking up the virus along with your bread and milk.

After a spell in 14-day quarantine in a share-house, Milan Leonard wanted a more considered approach to grocery shopping in lockdown.  


""Our house had been in isolation for a couple of weeks before that, because [one of my housemates was at the pub](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7393747/masked-up-assembly-works-to-restart-after-covid-close-call/) the day before we had our first case, and getting quite unlucky,"" Mr Leonard said.  


""And then a couple other of our housemates have quite bad COVID anxiety, and so I thought, you know, on the day that we're getting out and raring to get back to the shops because we've run out of supplies, may as well figure out the safest time to go.""

Mr Leonard, an honours student in physics who has worked in data science, analysed ACT Health's list of exposure sites, looking for the best time to go to the supermarket, to minimise the risk he and his three housemates would encounter the virus again.

Across Coles, Woolworths and IGAs in Canberra, the hour between 5pm and 6pm has had the most number of notifications for COVID-19 exposures.  


The best time to go to the supermarket, Mr Leonard's analysis showed, was early in the morning, and in the evening. The number of exposures were much lower after 7pm.

Mr Leonard said in an ideal world, one person would shop for everyone in the share-house.  


""Trying to organise four 20- and 21-, 22-year-olds to get their shopping done and figure out what they want to eat two weeks in advance is definitely not going to happen,"" he said.

About one-fifth of the 827 exposure sites and times identified to noon on Wednesday were at supermarkets, which have put pressure on supermarket workers forced to isolate.  


The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association has lobbied the ACT government for priority vaccinations for supermarket and takeaway food workers. 

""The ACT government acknowledges that there are many essential workers who due to their age have only recently become eligible for a vaccination. However, it is not possible to vaccinate everyone at once,"" a spokesman for ACT Health said.

A spokesman for Woolworths said hundreds of supermarket staff members had needed to isolate during the ACT outbreak, and they were being encouraged to get vaccinated.

""We're actively recruiting for team members across the ACT to help us provide the food and essentials our communities rely on both in-store and online,"" the spokesman said.

A spokeswoman for Coles said the supermarket's staff members were also encouraged to get vaccinated.

""Where a store is particularly impacted by team members in isolation, we rotate team members from other stores and utilise labour hire to assist with tasks like stocking shelves and replenishment,"" the spokeswoman said.  


The majority of exposure sites identified since the start of Canberra's lockdown, on August 12, have been casual or monitor-for-symptoms sites, meaning the risk of contracting COVID-19 was lower. No supermarkets have been identified as public sites of transmission.

Deputy chief health officer Dr Vanessa Johnston on Wednesday said health authorities were not focused on the number of exposure sites being identified in the community, but were assessing the risk they posed.  


""I think you'll note that most of those sites \[identified in the past few days \] are casual or even monitor for symptoms, where we don't actually request or require anyone to have a test. They're much lower risk,"" Dr Johnston said."|canberra|2021|True|0

It’s time to get the ACT border bubble going. Introduce a permit and police checkpoint system for the 4 NSW LGAs that share a border with the ACT (Queanbeyan-Palerang, Yass Valley, Snowy Valleys and Snowy Monaro) and slam shut the border to the rest of NSW.

"Background: Omicron is the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 with a significant number of genetic changes that make it spread faster than delta, [even through highly-vaccinated populations](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101147#referenceContainer). In some areas, its doubling rate has been measured as 2-3 days which means we are likely headed to steeply increasing case counts. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/forecasting/forecasts-cases.html) and the [EU's CDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-assessment-further-emergence-omicron-18th-risk-assessment) are both predicting large surges in caseload by Jan/Feb which may lead to hospital overwhelm once again.

While some news articles have pointed to it having a milder symptom profile, which would be welcome news, even if it hospitalized people at a significantly lower rate, we could still be looking at hospital overwhelm due to it spreading faster. And there is [some good reason to think](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/t-cells-omicron-vaccine-immunity/620995/) vaccines will hold much of their effectiveness at preventing hospitalization and death, the extent to which that is true will take time to determine. After all, infections take a while to turn into hospitalizations and death. So that's what's unknown.

What *is* known, and what has been known since day one, and what will not change no matter what variant comes around, is that **N95's provide excellent protection for you as the wearer and for those around you, and that even surgical masks (those blue three-ply ones with the flaps) provide** [**significantly better protection than cloth**](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/why-americans-wear-cloth-masks/620296/)**, and they are often distributed for free** to any customer who wants them by big box stores. Hell, you could go to Fred Meyers, buy nothing because of the strike, and hurt their bottom line by taking a free mask! N95s are the kind of mask that doctors and people working in a COVID ward wear to protect themselves from patients. They've been wearing them for decades to prevent the spread of all sorts of infectious diseases because they simply work that well.

Messaging on masks from the government has been terrible. Early on in the pandemic people were urged not to buy N95s so there would be enough left over for hospitals. That is over now and there are so many N95s available that factories [are shutting down for lack of demand](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/25/1009858893/u-s-companies-shifted-to-make-n95-respirators-during-covid-now-theyre-struggling). Many EU countries have required medical-grade masks for some time now, but we seem rather attached to our cloth ones here in the US. **I am not trying to mask shame anybody here**, just provide some information so you can make your own best decisions.

So this is your friendly reminder that NIOSH-certified N95’s, many of which are made in the USA, some of which are made [in Seattle](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/us/medical-ppe) are back in stock and waiting for you to buy them, you can find them at pretty much any hardware store and Amazon/Walmart/etc online. Here's a [useful buying guide](https://www.microcovid.org/blog/masks) for various types of masks, what kind of protection they offer, etc. Depending on what kind you are wearing, **cloth masks often offer** [little to no protection](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/why-americans-wear-cloth-masks/620296/) **for you as the wearer depending on how they are constructed**. They can block some droplets but are pretty ineffective at aerosols which are the primary route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. But any mask is better than no mask, of course.

For like $1/mask you could have nearly complete piece of mind. As an alternative, three-ply surgical masks (the blue kind you see being handed to maskless customers at every retailer) are also significantly more effective than cloth masks and more comfortable than N95s. When I'm at the grocery store, I don't care that some people don't wear a mask around me because I can rest assured knowing I have pretty much the best protection money can buy,

PS Be sure you have a proper seal, a poorly-sealed N95 loses a good amount of its effectiveness (but is still significantly better than any cloth mask with an equivalent amount of seal). Here is an [OSHA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGXiUyAoEd8) describing how to do this. While it's not so easy to do a ""fit test"" at home, a ""user seal check"" will get you most of the way.

Be sure to buy **unvalved** masks. Valved N95s which have a separate exhalation port on the front are great at protecting you but don't filter the air you exhale so they offer no significant benefit to people around you. They're the same price, skip the valve.

**--Common Questions and Myths--**

**N95s are disposable, I don't want to have to use a new mask every day!**

You *can* re-use your N95 masks, just as healthcare workers have done through much of the pandemic. I work at an office 8 hrs a day and wear one mask each week, on around the 7th day I notice it stops being as good at holding a seal. N95s being labeled as disposable has a lot more to do with policy and paperwork than reality. In healthcare settings historically, they have treated as disposable in a large part to prevent cross-contaminating between patients. The N95 standard requires a manufacturer to show that under conditions xyz the mask can filter air at a particular efficiency. So the manufacturer can make specific guarantees about that given generic environments and timescales (which they usually give as 8 hours), but that differs quite a bit from real life. A N95 mask will lose effectiveness over time, just as any other mask type, due to the filter becoming clogged, weakening seal on the face, etc. Obviously, somebody working in dusty conditions can't expect their mask to hold up as long as a somebody working in an office, but the manufacturer puts the same instructions on the package for both of them. Regardless, even if a N95 mask lost 75% of its effectiveness, it would still be more effective than most cloth masks. Of course, for the highest-risk of situations like a CDC lab where they study dangerous pathogens, you can bet that it makes sense to regularly replace N95s and treat them as disposable. But for your office or your neice's birthday party, you can stretch things a bit according to your own margin of safety. But refer to the manufacturer's directions of course, I'm just some guy on the internet who has been wrong before at least twice.

**So even if I can wear an N95 for a week, I can just wash my cloth mask and re-use it!**

Sure you can, but consider that while washing your cloth mask might be great for removing the dust, viruses, and whatever else it has filtered out of the air, it is also going to loosen up the fibers that make up the mask through re-hydrating them, de-hydrating them, heating, and cooling them. And bashing them around a bunch. This means small holes in the fabric that grow with time, continuing to diminish what was a relatively low effectiveness to begin with.

**I feel bad about the disposable nature of N95s for environmental reasons?**

This is a very valid concern, I can only give you information on effectiveness so you can make the decision that works best for you. Seatbelts are also made of plastic, but I vastly prefer driving with one on. If you are concerned with plastic waste or the carbon impact of N95s, consider the carbon impact of getting even a mild case of covid or passing it on to somebody else. Will you need to buy cough syrups that come in plastic bottles? Where do those ingredients come from? What about a covid test which uses a microchip to give you results? What is the carbon impact of a hospital stay? etc

**I work two jobs and can't afford to spend a bunch of money on new masks!**

If your goal is to spend zero dollars on masks, walk into any big box store and they will hand you a free three-ply blue surgical mask. They may even hand you more if you ask nicely. If you go in on a 50-pack of N95s with a friend or two, you can get the cost down to <$1 mask. One mask per week, four weeks a month, and you've bought yourself a month of protection for under $4. Also consider the economic impact of becoming sick in terms of being unable to work, having to buy medication, or having to see the doctor.

**What about KN95? Other international standards?**

Yes! All of these are better than cloth! Some of them even rival N95, especially if you can get a good face seal with them. I encourage you to read up more on them if you're interested.

**N95s are ugly, I like the way my mask looks!**

You can wear it over your N95 of course, it may even extend the life of your N95 to some extent. N95s come in a variety of shapes and colors, with surgical masks offering even more variety. You can always wear different kinds of masks for different places as well, depending on how risky they are.

**I heard many of the N95s are counterfeit? That I shouldn't buy from Amazon because of it?**

Early in the pandemic because there were no N95s available, the market was flooded by counterfeits. This issue has largely been resolved. Yes, Amazon has the SKU co-mingling issue (where they combine items from multiple sellers into the same bin), but all other major retailers do this as well. There are plenty of reasons to not order from Amazon anyways. Many counterfeits are essentially the same product, made on the same or similar machinery, but without the branding and paperwork behind them. I would trust a known counterfeit N95 mask over a cloth mask any day, because even if they aren't build to spec, it's really hard to provide less protection than a cloth mask.

**I made my own mask because I found a study saying cloth masks can be just as effective as N95s!**

There are a number of small studies showing that a well-constructed, multi-layer cloth mask can provide roughly the same protection as an N95. Some of these studies test the material's ability to filter air only, not make a good face seal which is critically important. Most don't ask the question ""for how long"" or ""what are the exact specs for this material aside from thread count"". And none of them are backed by real-world data where large groups of actual people wear them while being exposed to contagious diseases. They ask good questions about how we should be making masks in general, but the science is very new. We have decades of data and research both in the lab and in the real-world on the effectiveness of N95s and surgical masks. In the same way, there are many great books on field medicine, and they might save my life in a pinch, but unless I'm in sinkhole in the middle of the desert and my arm needs a tourniquet, I'm probably just going to go to the doctor and have them fix the problem or tell me how to. For <$1, I can have a N95 backed by decades of research which is built, designed, and tested by people who spend their entire lives researching mask design. And I don't have to worry that I put a stitch in the wrong place or washed it wrong. I'd say that's a pretty good deal.

**What if I have a beard? Don't N95s have to seal well to work?**

Yes, it's why you never see a surgeon with a beard. To get the full protective benefit of an N95, you need a proper seal, but being unable to get a proper seal also effects all other mask types, so you'll still be better off with a N95 so long as at least some air is passing through it, because it means that air is getting filtered better than a less-effective mask could.

"edited 11/4

its really real. FDA/CDC/Western States/OHA/Brown have all approved, you can now get vaccines for kids 5-11. IF you can find one. 

Please hear me out: your kid, at this point, will not be fully vaccinated for Thanksgiving, even if you run out and get it TODAY. You need 5 weeks, and many peds offices are scheduling shots 4 weeks apart. You can get it done before winter break, but you still have a week or two. I know you've waited a long time, but please, please do not karen/ken this the way we did last year. You will be able to get one of these vaccines almost anywhere next week- you don't need to inundate peds offices and pharmacies with calls. The information is ON THE WEBSITES. Sign up for your peds office's newsletter. This is the best way to get this info. 

Again, PLEASE DO NOT CALL PEDIATRICIANS OFFICES. Doing so means parents of sick kids can't get through to understaffed offices and doctors can't call in scripts to pharmacies. I promise, I will help you find vaxx slots next week. 

**Who is Eligible**

Kids 5-11, to get the Pfizer (and only the Pfizer) vaccine.

**How is it Different from Adult Doses?**

Children will receive a smaller dose of the vaccine than adults (1/3), but otherwise it the same protocol: 2 doses, spaced atleast 3 weeks apart.

**Is it as effective in kids as adults?**

[Effectiveness](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-children-5-through-11-years-age): Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.

**What are the risks?**

The same as they are in adults- there is a small risk of myocarditis. No myocarditis was observed in the trials at this age group, but from adult and adolescent use, we know the incidences of myocarditis are so low that its likely we wouldn't see them in anything but extraordinarily large sample groups.

**If I'm a kid 5-11 and my parents don't want me to get vaccinated, can I get it on my own?**

Sadly, no. In the state of Oregon you must be 15 years old to have medical sovereignty. Its encouraged to have ongoing conversations with parents and your physician to discuss getting vaccinated.

**When can I get my kid vaxxed?**

Some locations have received vaccines on 11/1, so a limited number of places may roll out doses this weekend. Many places are allowing you to schedule appointments BEFORE they have received vaccines (for instance, Sellwood and Brave don't have their doses yet, they're expected today). Neither I or the Oregonian know who got those 11/1 doses. 

But, the major factor is WHEN places receive these vaccines. They cannot use the existing vials, from what I understand, but are instead planning on using the specially designed new vials. Almost everyone I spoke to was expecting shipments next week. 

**Where do I get my kids vaccinated?**

**Private Pediatricians.**

[Sellwood Medical](https://www.sellwoodmd.com/)\- I like them because its drive thru. They seem great with kids who aren't great with needles.The Oaks Park event for this weekend is full, may get extended but for now, DO NOT CALL because no one can get you an appt. They will continue their drivethru at the office and when those appts are available, they will alert via newsletter.

[BraveCare](https://bravecare.com/)

**Insurer:**

[OHSU has a clinic at Doernbecher](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/vaccine-scheduling-oblc) for kids on Tue/Thurs/Weekends. They may expand the Expo Center to kids vaccines.KP is working with PPS and may also operate independant kids clinics, starting Nov 6.The Doernbecher clinic is inside. 

[Kaiser](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine) now has dates available. This is supposed to be a drive thru. Good luck getting through. 

Still seeking info on Providence, Salem, etc. If you have it please tag me in comments. 

**County:**

Multnomah County clinics- they expect to get vaccines starting next week BUT.... you will not be able to get pediatric vaccines through their existing clinics. They will open entirely new clinics specifically for kids, in mid November. These will be appointment only, and will be longer than adult appts. Stay tuned here:[https://www.multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/upcoming-covid-19-vaccination-clinics](https://www.multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/upcoming-covid-19-vaccination-clinics) for that info.

[Clackamas County](https://www.clackamas.us/coronavirus/vaccine) will begin offering vaccines to kids at all their scheduled clinics beginning Monday the 8th. These are appt only, call first. 

**Pharmacies:**

All major pharmacy chains have started accepting appointments for vaccine appts. Excepting LeCare, these are my least favorite place to send people for vaccinations. For kids, in particular I'd shy away from these locations and head to a pediatrician or specific kids clinic.

Again, I REALLY like [LeCare Pharmacy](https://www.lecarepharmacy.com/) for this. They expect to start kids vaccines next week, and they are not allowing people getting tested inside, and monoclonal antibody treatments are after hours.. so its a protected space and they just get people through FAST. This is an ideal spot if your kid isn't needle adverse.

**Schools:**

PPS will have clinics at 8 schools, all in lower income areas, operated in conjunction with Kaiser, but those dates have still not been released.

"MaxFund (a no-kill animal shelter off of Santa Fe), is in desperate need of bleach! They're currently battling kennel cough, and all of the panic buying has left them in desperate need of bleach.

Both our cat and dog shelters are in need of bleach.  We have looked everywhere we possibly could to buy bleach in any amount, bulk or not, and have come up short.  If any of you have even one bottle of bleach you're willing to donate to the shelter, please bring it in!

"My GF, her kid, and myself went to the rally in Denver and soon after our daughter came down with a sever sore throat, cough, and super high fever for a week. very unusual for her. got tested for strep, came back negative. Soon after my GF had mild symptoms including slight fever, shortness of breath (for a day) and headaches. I didn’t have any symptoms. 

We were wondering if anyone else reported similar illness and/or tested positive soon after for COVID-19. More out of curiosity. Impossible to prove but the Fillmore was PACKED that day and Colorado stats say the virus was already circulating by early January."|Denver|2020|True|0

#Most Important Advice to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19:


- Wash your hands frequently, for 20 second (about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" from start to finish) washing all parts including between fingers. Hand sanitizers may be used as a substitute, but hand washing is preferable. Moisturizing soap will help prevent over-drying your hands. 

- **Stay at home unless it is important to leave.** Avoid gatherings of people, especially large ones and try to maintain a physical distance of 6-feet from other people. Do not shake hands.

- Avoid touching your face, eyes, and mouth especially with unwashed hands. Cough into your elbow rather than your hands. 

- Sanitize doorknobs, counters, sink faucets and other frequently touched surfaces. First clean, then you can use disinfectant wipes, [diluted bleach ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html), full strength hydrogen peroxide, or a disinfectant spray to kill any viruses that may be on the surface.

- Don't hoard needed items; don't be a stupid, selfish asshole.

"I work at a mall in the area and my store is one of the only ones still open despite it not being an essential business whatsoever. A few days ago I developed a cough and some cold like symptoms and decided to go home. Today was my next scheduled day and things haven’t gotten any better for me so I decided to call in again. I couldn’t help but sense some frustration from the manager. 

Now I’m feeling guilty but I don’t think I should have to feel this way. I’m not going because I care about myself and my coworkers and don’t want to get anyone sick ( I work with a lot of older people and if I were to have a virus it could potentially kill them). I don’t feel good about taking that risk at all. I also don’t have health insurance. I’m sure everyone is aware of the current situation but I’m just looking for some support. 

I don’t think it’s fair to me or my coworkers that I even have to make that decision. I could potentially be putting everyone at risk but it seems like no one cares about that at all. All similar stores have been shut down for a week or more at this point and have given their employees paid leave. I’m not looking for a handout, and based on every other similar store’s response to this situation, it doesn’t seem right that we’re still open. I don’t think my company can afford to do anything for their employees so that’s where I’m at. 

Am I making the right decision? I mean, is that even a question I need to ask? It just sucks because it seems like this isn’t being taken seriously at all by my employer. I don’t want to put anyone at risk and I constantly hear that I should be staying at home if I’m sick. I don’t want to lose my job over this but I don’t feel comfortable being around that many other people. Is anyone else in a similar situation? What are you doing about it?

Update: We shut down after the statewide order. I’m not receiving anything from the company but I will be ok financially. They really hung us out to dry lol. Thanks for all your support and helpful perspectives!"|Denver|2020|True|1
"Hello all.  Just wondering... What are all the bartenders and waitstaff doing for work right now?  Everyone in my household is service industry, and a couple of us will likely not make rent this month.  I know everyone is recommending grocery stores and Amazon warehouse jobs right now, but I've applied online, and in person at my local grocery, and keep getting the run around from people that come off too busy to really worry about people, and they obviously don't have a problem finding people at the moment.  The Amazon warehouse in Thornton had a job fair last weekend, but when I got there, they were cancelling it, and telling everyone to apply online, because the line was packed into a small space and everyone was coughing on each other with no standing room. 

A friend put me in touch with a job placement agency, that was supposed to be placing people at King soopers faster than just applying directly through them.  I was able to sort of find work through them, but it comes with a lot of strings.  First of all you have to spend all day driving around to fax/scan all the necessary documents.  This includes meeting someone you're not related to, and don't live with, in person to verify your documents are real, and they have to give their information and vouch for you I guess.  After all that is done, you get work on a week to week basis as a 1099 contractor.  They schedule you for around 48 - 56 hours a week, and you don't get overtime.  On top of that, you really only get the shit work at the store, you have to get multiple signatures before you leave every day, the store stamp, then scan the document that was signed and stamped, and upload it back to the agency.  After that, they will send you a link to a survey, which you have to take, everyday, or every shift, in order to get paid.  I don't want to come off as being too good for all this, because I'll do it.  I just wonder what everyone else is doing, and if there's better options.

I'm also an I.T. professional, but gave up my career 3 years ago to move to this amazing place, and I'm pretty sure most of those gigs aren't hiring at the moment, because they don't want to hire more people that just want to work from home.  Any suggestions, or shared stories would be greatly appreciated.  Hope you're all staying safe out there."|Denver|2020|True|0
" Hi Denver---

I,  like so many, have been caught off guard by this pandemic. I have been  trying to find a thermometer online the past 2-3 days, but cannot find  them anywhere.

I feel like I have a  fever right now, no cough, no shortness of breath, but I am nervous  about it. Does anyone have a lead/help on getting a digital thermometer  for myself?

I  do not want to go into a store, searching for out of stock items, while  potentially getting sick OR infecting someone. If you have an extra  thermometer around or can point me where I can buy one, I will venmo you  or whatever, so I can check my temperature.

Thank you"|Denver|2020|True|1

"I work for a Colorado grocery chain. I can't say which one or which store, but they're all in the same shape right now. 

Please, please, please learn to compromise on what you want to eat. We may not have your favorite flavors. We may only have one type of rice, beans, pasta, if we have them at all. Things might not be over the right price tag, we have to put out whatever food we can, wherever we can fit it.

We all have a social responsibility to take only what we need, and make sure our neighbors and community stay fed too. There's not an official limit on how much food you can take, but don't be that asshole that takes all of the ramen, rice, pasta, etc off the shelf. For many stores that's all the food we have on the shelf for days at a time. You aren't just taking all of the food from the store, you're taking it from an entire community.

Grocery employees are working extremely long hours in dangerous conditions we were never prepared for. I personally have worked 12 hour shifts for the past 3 days with only today off, being exposed to hundereds and hundreds of people. Many people are asking what they can do to help. Honestly, the best thing you can do is be kind to one another, be understanding, be thankful for what you have. Say thank you, buy your stockers something to drink (we love energy drinks and coffee lol), and please don't cough on us.

We love you Colorado, and we're trying to keep you fed!

"This post serves both as a renewal of the previous post [""Denver Area COVID-19 Resources and News""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/feybzc/denver_area_covid19_resources_and_news/) and an update of some guidelines as to where to read and post content related to C-19 as the virus continues to spread through Denver.

As moderators during this crisis, our paramount goal is provide the less important topical posts and discussions. In order to achieve this goal, we will encourage the majority of posts regarding covid-19 to be posted in /r/CoronavirusColorado, and important announcements to be posted here. Further I would like to encourage everyone to subscribe to both subs and recommend using the a [multireddit to view both](https://old.reddit.com/user/ElLechero/m/corona_colorado/), if you wish.

**[Colorado/Denver COVID-19 Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado+CoronavirusColorado+Denver/)**

#Here's a brief summary of what to post where:

1. General Discussion about Covid-19

**Post in this thread.**

2. Important announcements specifically related to Denver by the The Mayor, Governor, or a major government agency such as the CDC

**Make a new post on /r/denver.**

3. Where to find toilet paper, or similar frequently asked questions. [Search /r/denver,](https://old.reddit.com/r/Denver/search/?q=toilet&sort=relevance&restrict_sr=on&t=week) See [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusColorado/comments/fjkb37/31620_post_grocery_drug_store_restaurant_retail/) in /r/CoronavirusColorado or ask in the [Q&A sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/about/sticky).

If you can't decided where to post, ask yourself the following. ""Is this critically important, well-sourced information that relates to Denver?"" If the answer is yes, please post it here, if not, but it is still of moderate importance, or interest to you personally, post it to /r/CoronavirusColorado, or ask in the comment section below.


#Most Important Advice to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19:


- Wash your hands frequently, for 20 second (about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" from start to finish) washing all parts including between fingers. Hand sanitizers may be used as a substitute, but hand washing is preferable. Moisturizing soap will help prevent over-drying your hands. 

- Avoid gatherings of people, especially large ones and try to maintain a social distance of 6-feet from other people. Avoid shaking hands

- Avoid Touching your face, eyes, and mouth especially with unwashed hands. If you cough, use your elbow rather than your hands.

- Sanitize doorknobs, counters, sink faucets and other frequently touched surfaces. First clean, then you can use disinfectant wipes, [diluted bleach ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html), full strength hydrogen peroxide, or a disinfectant spray to kill any virii that may be on the surface.

- Don't hoard needed items; don't be a stupid, selfish asshole.

Joint Statement Regarding Dangerous Restrictions by States on COVID-19 Public Health Measures
 
August 2, 2021

U.S. colleges and universities will soon open for the fall 2021 semester, bringing together millions of students, faculty, and staff to resume on-campus activities. Most institutions plan to operate at full capacity: full classrooms and in-person instruction; full residence halls; full stadiums; full intramural and intercollegiate athletics; and a full array of social events. This comes at a particularly worrisome time, with the COVID-19 Delta variant, a far more aggressive and more transmissible COVID-19 strain, now so widespread across the country that it accounts for an estimated 83% of coronavirus cases. The increasing number of hospitalizations of unvaccinated teenagers and young adults is also deeply concerning. Colleges and universities have nearly 18 months of hard-won experience in responding to the pandemic and preventing and containing the spread of the virus on campus and in their surrounding communities. Continued success will require having all effective public health strategies at their disposal to curtail the Delta variant and prevent a surge in COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths this fall.


An increasing number of states have restricted the ability of colleges and other organizations to deploy an evidence-based combination of strategies to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks on campus and in surrounding communities and respond to them promptly and effectively should they occur. Some states forbid inquiries about an array of vaccinations, including COVID-19; ban vaccination requirements; block required COVID-19 surveillance testing; and restrict the use of evidence-based mitigation strategies, including masking. Many of these restrictions directly contradict CDC guidance. State actions that prevent the use of established and effective public health tools at the same time as COVID-19 cases increase is a recipe for disaster. 


These restrictions undermine the ability of all organizations, including colleges and universities, to operate safely and fully at a time of tremendous unpredictability. Furthermore, these restrictions prohibit higher education institutions from taking responsible and reasonable public health measures and ultimately threaten the health and safety of students, faculty, staff, and neighboring communities.


The American College Health Association (ACHA), joined by the American Council on Education (ACE) and the undersigned national higher education organizations, urges all government officials, who are charged with the responsibility of protecting the public health, to empower colleges and universities to use every available public health tool to protect campuses and neighboring communities from a COVID-19 surge this fall.

"Most Des Moines hospitals are not yet joining a national trend to require health care employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, although the region's two largest hospital systems are considering it. 

Among the Des Moines area's eight hospitals, only the Veterans Affairs Medical Center requires employees to be vaccinated if they care for patients. That decision was announced by officials in Washington, D.C., on Monday.

Proponents of mandatory vaccinations for health care workers say it's necessary to protect vulnerable patients from infection by the deadly virus. But critics contend vaccinations should be an individual choice.

UnityPoint Health-Des Moines and MercyOne-Des Moines, which run six of the area's hospitals, said this week that they do not currently require employees to be vaccinated. But they're thinking about it.

"Iowa leaders prioritized politics over public health during the coronavirus pandemic — contributing to disproportionate COVID-19 infections, unnecessary deaths and low vaccination rates in Black communities, Black leaders and critics said. 

“We are such a small number they don’t feel they have to act on our concerns,” said Donna Henderson, owner of Henderson’s Highland Park Funeral Home, one of two Black-owned funeral homes in the state.

About 90% of Iowa’s population is white; 4% is Black. More than 407,838 Iowans have tested positive, and more than 6,170 people have died from the disease, as of July 22. Blacks accounted for 12,158 cases, and 157 Blacks have died from COVID-19, according to the Iowa COVID-19 Tracker, an independent tracking site.


Donna Henderson, owner of Henderson’s Highland Park Funeral Home in Des Moines, said the needs of Black Iowans were ignored in the state’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Photo by Black Iowa News.
“The COVID-19 virus was running rampant in our community,” said Henderson, whose funeral home has been a fixture in Des Moines for 20 years. “The impact of the deaths aren’t as shocking here because of the small number of minorities in Des Moines. It doesn’t sound like a lot — unless it’s your family.”

When the pandemic — and year of social unrest following George Floyd’s murder — swept across Iowa upending lives, Blacks braved outbreaks on the front lines, on unemployment, in prisons, unhoused, distanced from their places of faith and skeptical of the institutions that were supposed to protect them.

"Hey guys really sorry to be that guy but this is kind of urgent. Over the last 5 days I’ve been fighting this bug or virus or whatever it is and I’ve managed to get rid of the fever and chills I was having but I still have a very much severe sore throat. 

I’ve been going back and forth and a friend whose going to school for nursing and she suggested that I see a doctor because I could potentially have strep or some other viral infection. I can’t swallow anything (not water or tea or even my own spit) without feeling this overwhelming burning sensation in my throat. My lymph nodes are also swollen around my neck as well as a sharp pain in my left ear

At first I was being macho about it thinking this would blow over but this has gone on for 5 days now and I’m starting to get concerned. The only thing is I don’t have heath insurance and I wouldn’t be able to come out of pocket much either.

"So I just straight up had the most terrifying experience I’ve ever had on public transit. I’m badly shaken and just need to vent.

So, I’m just visiting - I’m from Toronto but am in Philly for the weekend. I wanted to go to Steve’s for a steak (since I’ve heard good things) and figured my best route is to take the blue line from City Hall to FTC.

As the train was chugging along, I just had my headphones in minding my own business, till some random guy behind me leans over and uses my shoulder as an arm rest. Weird, but whatever. Didn’t think twice of it. 

Then as the train approaches Erie-Torresdale, this guy starts motioning for me to get off. I ignore him. He now escalates and stands in the doorway and badgering me to get off. I tell him “no” and then ignore him again. He continues doing this for another minute or so and getting a little freaked out at this point. I try telling other people in the car “listen, I don’t know what’s his problem. I have no idea who he is and I’m not getting off”. No one else  seems to care about how freaked out I am and no one lifts a finger to help. In fact a couple people move away from me and tell me not to bring my problem over here after I start pacing my way around the car thinking for a creative way to fake him out. I thought I had him once or twice but every time he’d exit, he’d notice me not coming and get back in the doorway.

So a conductor or security (some SEPTA official) comes by and asks what’s going on. I am pleading and begging at this point “can you please tell him to get off? He’s holding up the train thinking I’m getting off but I’m not getting off”. Even he doesn’t step in and barely does shit. The straggler then ends up telling me to get off because I promised him change or something (I never spoke a word to him or promised him shit). I refused.

Then this guy delivers a hard slap to my arm. Straight up assaults me. At this point, I raise my hands up and am like “fucking help, please”. Then I’m guessing a couple people in the car behind mine start yelling and telling him to fuck off because this guy has been holding up the car, torturing me, and now physically assaulting me for the last 3-5 mins.

He’s finally told to fuck off as he starts yelling at me while getting off. At this point, I’m begging, praying, pleading for the doors to just close. You can’t even begin to describe the relief I felt when the doors finally closed with him on the platform.

But fuck. I’m completely rattled. I feel sick. I even felt bad and started apologizing to people on the train and telling them I had no idea what the fuck was happening. I even feel a bit scared to take the train back. I felt like I was fighting for my life out there. I was never going to get off the train. I didn’t want anything to do with having to be anywhere near him.

I don’t know what the fuck my recourse even is here. I’m just a random nobody out of towner. Fuck."|Philadelphia|2022|True|0

"I'm a paramedic for a rural operation in Southern Colorado. In the year that I've been down here I've ran 5 fatal wrecks and they've all had one thing in common. Texas plates. 
I see dozens of Texans driving our interstate every day and without fail they're driving 15 under in the passing lane, 20 over in the right lane, tailgating other cars, or trying to drive on ice and snow with a 2wd vehicle with bald tires. STOP. I'm tired of yall killing Coloradians headed to work because they obviously don't teach yall to drive in Texas. 
So, if you decide to drive here (Don't), please remember the speed limit on the interstate isn't just a suggestion, the left lane is for passing other motorists and then getting back in the right lane, and you shouldn't ever try to come up here between the months of September and July unless you learn to drive in the snow and know how to maintain your vehicle, because I'm sick of waking up at 0300 to clean up your bloody messes.

"Dear Members of our Boston University Community, 

State, local, and [Boston University data](https://www.bu.edu/healthway/community-dashboard/), all continue to indicate favorable trends related to COVID-19. Last week’s 7 day test positivity rate for all BU community members was well under 1.0%. In recognition of this, we are announcing some important changes to our COVID-19 protocols beginning on **March 7, 2022.** 

**Faculty and Staff Community Testing**  

Faculty and staff will no longer be **required** to test weekly as part of our regular community testing program. Testing will still be **available** for faculty and staff who would like to continue testing or who need to test due to a [close contact exposure.](http://www.bu.edu/back2bu/files/2022/01/COVID_CloseContactProtocol.pdf) We encourage anyone with symptoms to continue to self-schedule testing through the Healthway portals at the [Health Services Annex](https://maps.bu.edu/?id=647#!m/505054?ce/49884?ct/0). 

**Face Masks** 

We have updated our [face mask policy](https://www.bu.edu/back2bu/campus-life-undergraduates/student-health-safety/face-coverings/) and are no longer requiring masks to be worn in **most areas on our campuses** including dining halls, residential housing common areas, shared offices, libraries, food courts, Fit-Rec, athletic venues, and common areas in buildings and colleges. Masks **continue to be required** indoors for classes, on the BU Shuttle, and in all healthcare facilities.

We encourage everyone to continue to use high-quality filtering masks such as N95s, KN95s, KF94s, and FFP2s to reduce viral transmission based on personal risk. We ask that everyone be respectful of optional mask use in areas that no longer have a mask requirement in place and acknowledge that this will be a significant transition for many.

A high-quality mask worn correctly will significantly reduce the risk of viral transmission **even if others around you are not masked**. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html) has also recently updated their masking guidance based on levels of community transmission with a COVID-19 County Check search function available for reference. At this time Boston and Brookline still have public mask mandates in place so it is important to keep a mask with you and be aware of local regulations. 

**Vaccination Verification at Public Venues** 

We continue to recommend that all visitors to Boston University are up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations and adhere to any masking policies that are in effect. The Fitness & Recreation Center and venues which host ticketed and non-ticketed entertainment and athletic events open to the general public will **no longer be requiring** proof of vaccination for entry and our [visitor policy](https://www.bu.edu/back2bu/campus-life-undergraduates/visitors-and-travel-policies/) has been updated accordingly.  

Please see our [Back2BU](https://www.bu.edu/back2bu/campus-life-undergraduates/student-health-safety/face-coverings/) website for updates and additional details about our COVID-19 protocols. 

Many thanks for your support as we evolve our public health protocols,

"Hi Boise, 

I have been sick for the last 10 days with flu like symptoms but not a hint of respiratory symptoms. Fever, chills, body aches, headaches, vomiting, skin rashes/scratchy skin, insatiable thirst. The symptoms are not all the time and change from day to day.

I went to urgent care 4 days in and tested negative for flu/Covid /cold, urine looked good too. 6 days in, I attempted to take a shower and lost my vision and was able to make it to my bed before falling - no color in face and lips slightly blue. Went to ER. Had chest x-ray, blood work, and ultrasound of my right side organs. Bloodwork showed signs of my body fighting something. Negative for cold/flu/Covid/RSV, urine looked good again. ER believes it’s some sort of virus they do not test for and to drink lots of water, rest, and it should resolve itself. 

Now I’m on day 10 (4 days since ER), and still feel like garbage and no diagnosis. 

Boise - has anyone had or is anyone having similar symptoms? We’re you able to pinpoint what the cause was? How long did the symptoms last for?"|Boise|2023|True|1

"I'm always very diligent about getting my flu shot, and under normal circumstances I get them in August ASAP.

But this year for obvious reasons I'm super anxious and paranoid about going indoors if I don't have to (I really do not want to go into a Walgreens to interact with people). Is there anyone doing flu shots outdoors at all? Like in tents in parking lots, etc? I had one one year at a community college where the nursing students gave them outdoors in a tent, and that'd be exactly what I'm looking for.

"This morning I watched a man crap in a paper bag and wipe with newspaper.  I was shocked and sad, disgusted and impressed. How is it that in our big city, in this wealthy-ass country, a great deal of folks are left without the basic functions of running water and a toilet?

Let’s back up a bit to the beginning of my long day:

I started my 14-hour shift in a bus at SE 17th and Center.  I found my numbered bus in the numbered lane. Before I began my pre-trip inspection, I pushed the driver’s seat up to hang my bag on the hook behind it and in doing so, I noticed kitty litter adhered to the floor just under the seat. Remnants of some kind of bio clean up, I assumed. Did the operator get sick?  Were they assaulted?  What kind of bodily fluid was this and how did it get UNDER the seat?  My mind cycled through all of the possibilities as I proceeded with the inspection of the rest of the bus.

As I walked around the bus to check the lights and signs, check the tires and look for any body damage, I wondered how many operators have had “accidents” in the driver’s seat. I’ve heard stories of operators vomiting into the trash bins, sick with the flu (pre-COVID) and unwilling to call in (any time loss, even if you have endless sick leave, is a negative mark on our record—just 4 hours of time loss could cost someone a promotion). I’ve heard stories of coworkers with Crohn’s or IBS unable to find a restroom in time, resulting in them going home early in a dirty uniform. I also read that story of the Lift operator who was caught urinating in a bush, after an unsuccessful hunt for a bathroom, only to be fired for it. Times have become tougher for our bathroom needs lately, since so many places are closed. 

And I thought of Thomas Dunn as I pumped the breaks. I wondered how much blood was in that seat and the floor below after his throat was slashed and his heart pumped its last beat. I wondered if that bus went back in service after the kitty litter was shaken down and swept back up. 

The life just one bus has, after years of being on the road and tens of thousands of people in and out of its doors. Hundreds of operators experiencing the city from that seat and through those windows.

The things I have seen in the 19 months or so that I have been driving has shown me more than I could have ever imagined.  Lately I’ve been able to witness the aftermath of the protests. I was driving the 14 the day that elk statue was removed. I drove through the intersection carefully, as there were spectators and photographers lined up in the edge of the sidewalk. The crane was just lifting the statue up as I maneuvered around it.  When I came back around it was gone. My heart sunk, not knowing when I would see it again.

I’ve driven through early in the morning to find graffiti all over the buildings in a 2 or 3 block radius and see fences down, constricting the sidewalk. I’m amazed at how many surfaces have been painted with BLM, ACAB or the like.

I have also watched artists paint murals through my shifts throughout the week. Every pass I make I get to inspect the progress. We have so many talented artists in this city. I have been caught off-guard by a spread and have teared up on the road.

I’ve been on the lookout for Portland’s so-called violent criminals. The worst I have found in all my hours and overtime on the road has been the lady today who didn’t pay her fare, didn’t wear a mask, and blocked the aisle with her bag. She refused to move because she’s didn’t “want to sit in the wheelchair seating”. The bus was empty. When she finally seated herself properly (after a bit of an argument), she stated firmly, “If some wheelchair comes on here, this is going to be your fault!”  So really, things haven’t changed for me. Same ol’, same ol’. 

Portland may have a bit more graffiti and fences, but it still feels the same. I feel safe, although sometimes annoyed, wherever I go. This is not some crazy, scary place with rampant, violent criminals.

Yeah. Sure. We’ve had a lot of vandalism here, more than normal. But that can be taken care of with power washing, paint, and replacement parts.  You know what can’t be easily wiped clean?  Trauma. Trust. You know what can’t be replaced?  Eyes. Lives. FUCKING HUMAN LIVES.

For any of you who are ho-humming about protesters, please remember that these people are your fellow Americans. Fucking fellow Americans. How DARE you joke about gunning down protestors because you’re “tired of their bullshit”.

I’ve learned more about this city than I ever thought I would. I’ve met friends and strangers and people that brighten my day in the most random ways. I miss and worry about people that most likely don’t even know who I am.

There are two people who I have been asking my fellow operators about and so far I haven’t been able to confirm a sighting of either of them. This has become a daily worry for me. I’ve taken the long way home (as in driving to the complete other side of town several miles  and then back), to see if I could find these guys. I don’t even think I would stop and say anything. I just want to.....I NEED to know they are okay right now, during this stressful, heartbreaking, scary, angry time we are living through.

You know what I fantasize about?  As I move the bus in and out of town, I daydream about the moment that my bus is packed to the brim again.  I get giddy over the idea of using the sign “SORRY—AT CAPACITY” when the bus is actually full-full and not just at a 12-15 passenger limit.*  I’ve forgotten what it feels like to drive pedal-to-the-metal and sluggishly get over a bridge due to the immense weight of the passengers crammed into 300 square feet.

*NOTE:  Before all of this, we would send a message to dispatch to let them know that we could not fit another soul onto our bus when it got full. At this point, we would then just pass up intending passengers without notice—our signs wouldn’t change. But in the future, I’m hoping that we will be able to use this new sign to communicate with those hopeful folks at the bus stops so that they don’t get confused or think we are just being dicks and passing them up.

I rehearse my announcement (that I will never actually announce) in my head. Something about how it hasn’t been since February 2020 that I’ve driven a bus this full, and that I’m so glad to see that everyone has survived and is back at work. I imagine giving every person on that bus a big hug and the love fest commences.  Everyone is laughing and crying and this moment becomes the finite moment that everything turns around and the world we live in is not just back to normal, but better than it was in February 2020.  A world where not only can we hug our parents and make out with strangers at a bar, but where essential employees make a living wage and Black lives are valued and protected. A world where police are patient and understanding and don’t rely on their weapons. A world where Karens learn to learn and children are safe at school.  A world where everyone has a bathroom. 

I’ve been a terrible mix of heartbroken and angry through a lot of this. The last time I posted on reddit (and then deleted the following morning), I was an angry drunk and told many to fuck off and/or to suck a bag of dicks. While I may stand by the sentiments, that is very unlike me. I rarely lose my shit and that night I lashed out online as well as in person to people who I love. I have been on edge lately, as I can safely assume so many of you have been.

This is unchartered territory for us, and unfortunately Portland has become a guinea pig for the Trump administration, so we are all feeling a bit more pressure than normal.

I cannot wait for things to become better than the old normal. We have that ability to make that difference. I applaud and wholeheartedly thank every protestor who has been boots-on-the-ground for the rest of us. I cannot risk an ER visit for pepper spray (medical issues), nor can I risk an arrest. So I am so damn thankful for those of you who are out there doing the hard work for the rest of us who cannot, for one reason or another, put our actual lives on the line. Endlessly grateful to y’all.


All of my love and bathroom-finding wishes to you.

"hi, I was just there so I thought I'd anecdotally share my experience. it was my first time to Dodgers Stadium :) and my first COVID test. I didn't know what to expect, but basically there was a lot of waiting, and the test is quite self-explanatory. Fingers crossed I didn't somehow managed to eff it up.

from when I arrived and started waiting until when I pulled out of the parking lot, it was 1 hour and 45 minutes. This was from \~11:15 am - 1 pm.

I made an appointment for 11:30 but AFAIK no one checked the appt time--you MUST have an appt, but I'm not sure it matters if you arrive at that time, especially with the wait. You have to have a confirm number from your appt, that's how they keep track of you. It's in the email with the QR code.

It was busy, obviously. Hundreds of cars.

I waited first on Stadium way, and it was 30 minutes til I got into the parking lot itself. 1 hr 15 from that point. I don't think there's any particular way to approach or line to be in that would be fastest, every line seemed to be going about the same. It's very well organized and there's a ton of people there to help you--traffic cops on the streets, volunteers at the site. The testing itself--once I got my test, got up to the instructions, swabbed my cheek, dropped it in the blue bucket--was about 10 minutes.

if you have questions about the process I didn't mention, comment and I'll try to answer them.

"I booked my first dose in early September when they finally approved intradermal method which allowed for a lot more appointments to open up. I was told I would have to wait 2 months in between but few days ago they announced I was eligible to get it after the recommended 4 weeks as they’re allowing anyone to get the vaccine starting Oct 6. Super easy to [schedule an appointment online](https://vax4nyc.nyc.gov/patient/s/monkeypox)

I got both doses done intradermally. Here some [photos](https://imgur.com/a/fMhCzE8), I wasn’t good about taking photos daily. 

First dose:
Day 0 - got the shot, little bubble but no swelling or redness or itchiness. I went to the LIC and it was super organized and set up was great. People were super helpful and no waiting. They check your ID and ask the same screening questions multiple times. After the shot, someone is assigned to monitor you for 15 min as you wait. I went about my day afterwards. The whole thing took about 25 min

Day 1 - injection site got more swollen and red and itchy. I felt super tired and my body was a little weak. Had a small headache but no fever or chills

Day 2 - injection site even more swollen and itchier. I’m allergic to mosquito bites so that’s what it looked and felt like. More annoying than alarming. I tried my best not to scratch it. Felt tired still

Day 3~7 - itchiness peaked at day 3&4 and it looked pretty bad. By day 5, swelling and itchiness went down

Day 8~21 - formed a little red bump. Itchiness gone

Day 22-28 - less red and fading into a dark purple scar/bruise. Still a little bump and skin started to peel on the bump

I’m on day 2 of second shot and expect to go through the same thing. The first week feels the worst because it looks and feels like an infected bug bite. Itchy as fuck

Anyways there’s not much info out there on side effects from getting it intradermally so I’m just sharing my experience and I’m happy I got it."|NewYorkCity|2022|True|0
"Hey guys, this is probably the wrong sub but we are in Minnesota and it’s regarding a Minnesota trade union and Minnesota insurance so I wasn’t sure if anyone happened to know.

Every time we see a doctor, even one that says it’s in network, our insurance sends up sending us a reimbursement check completely the blue. I got a 500 dollar check a few months ago because that was what I owed after insurance for a bunch of labs I had done at Park Nicollet. Then I just got this in the mail tonight-and it was from when my daughter had her yearly well-check (the only thing I can think of that would have cost was the flu shot). Does anyone know why this is? I’m obviously NOT complaining but I’ve never seen this with any insurance I’ve been on. Usually you just get the bill after insurance and you’re stuck paying it. Also when I check out plan book, it mentions nothing about everything being covered 100% (outside of the preventative stuff) , except for childbirth and a few others so I’m just cheerfully confused!"|Minnesota|2023|True|0
"I, like many, am now watching Gov. Reynolds' press briefings during this Covid-19 pandemic. I'll start by saying that her office has taken swifter action than many states. I believe this is due to the fact that Iowa essentially went from 0 cases to roughly 16 immediately which jolted them awake.

Many times I've heard Gov. Reynolds say ""if you're sick, stay home"". While true, I am concerned that many Iowans take the inverse to be true by assumption, ""if you're not sick, you dont need to stay home"".  This isn't true, this virus is very stealthy and efficient. Someone could have it and not know it at all, but still be contagious. Someone could be infected for up to 14 days before they get health issues. I think she needs to be honest, and inform the public that you can be ""sick"" before you even know it. Lots of people could make better choices with more clear guidance from leadership.  Essential people of all types are going to have to continue functioning, so non-essential people need to pitch in by staying home. You could be a spreader for 14 days after your last interaction in public.  

The virus also lives on surfaces. Most things say hard surfaces, like metal or plastic, for up to 3 days. That's why you need to wash your hands. I think the Governors office would do well to explain WHY we need to wash our hands. And to emphasize that the virus will die eventually on it's own, which is a good thing. In theory, you could leave an item you obtained in a room for 3 days and hopefully it will be decontaminated.  We CAN slow it down if we start considering these things.

 TL;DR- I think Gov. Reynolds needs to be clear that all non-essential people need to stay home even if they dont have symptoms, not just sick people  

Finally, we are all in this together. Help others as best you can.  And take care to slow the spread. 

Thanks and be safe fellow Iowans!"|Iowa|2020|True|0
Today, Von Maur executives received a pay cut and all hourly employees for Von Maur had their hours reduced with no additional compensation due to COVID-19. They were told they could supplement with previously accrued PTO and will be given no additional sick time. The hourly employees were informed of this in a meeting of over one hundred individuals, in one room. This is completely irresponsible and impractical behavior on behalf of this employer during a pandemic. When many companies are pushing for social distancing and offering resources such as catastrophe pay and additional PTO, what excuse does a non-essential department store offer for providing no care for their employees and incentivizing them to continue working and potentially contracting and spreading illness due to a lack of a financial safety net? They must do better and we as a community must come together to let them know that this is not acceptable.|Iowa|2020|True|0

"I'm tired of the scaremongering and emotional reasoning, and most of you probably are too. It's been a long and difficult year, so it's tiring to see negativity everywhere when we have more reason now than ever before to believe we're nearly at the end. So I decided to put a few sources together explaining why I'm optimistic in as factual a way as possible.

**Is herd immunity even possible?** In short, the data still indicates the answer is **yes**. I'm sure most of us have read yesterday's NYT article that paints a gloomy picture of never reaching herd immunity.^(1) It's worth noting that the article contains very little actual data-oriented scientific analysis, instead being a small collection of expert opinions and nebulous extrapolations of current vaccination rates. While it may be the opinion of a small group of experts, there is also substantial reason to believe it is wrong. First, real-world data from Israel suggests that somewhere between 60-70% vaccination is sufficient to suppress cases to a trickle (they're now in double-digits-per-day territory, from a high of nearly 10000/day).^(2) Second, I don't believe you can stake a case for herd immunity being impossible entirely on vaccine hesitancy. Remember, immunity comes from both vaccination *and* infection. Even though it's considered distasteful to note this, the fact still remains that most studies suggest that ""natural immunity"" is quite robust,^(3) which is why reinfections remain rare.^(4) The big question is how much overlap is there between vaccinated and infected individuals? That's an almost impossible question to definitively answer, but it's worth noting that the most vaccine-hestitant are typically the same people who disregard precautions and are at a higher risk for infection. Infections among them still count toward herd immunity (although for the sake of their safety, of course it's better that they instead get vaccinated). So while we may not see a rapid drop to zero cases, it's quite likely we will see cases precipitously drop to a manageable level as the virus gradually burns out in its smaller pockets.

**What about variants?** I'm going to come out and say it directly: the idea that we're on the verge of a ""variant apocalypse"" where we're sent back to last March is not a scientific reality. Sure, it is theoretically possible, but that's a long way from saying it's probably going to happen. So what does the current scientific consensus actually tell us about the Covid variants? Mainly that Covid mutates relatively slowly (approximately half the rate of flu),^(5) sometimes into variants that are somewhat more infectious, but there is still no evidence that it can fully evade immunity (the J&J vaccine was actually tested against the S. Africa variant and found to be 64% effective against moderate-to-severe Covid and 100% effective against hospitalization and death).^(6) It's also important to note that there are only so many ways the virus can mutate. The virus is able to infect cells because the spike protein on its surface has a shape that lets it bind very strongly to proteins in lung cells called ACE2 receptors. In order for the virus to escape immunity, it needs to mutate the spike protein so significantly that the immune system no longer recognizes it, while still also having the spike protein be a good ""fit"" for the ACE2 receptor (the immune response to both Covid infection and vaccination is also such that the immune system can recognize a variety of different Spike protein ""shapes,"" which is why there is also protection against variants). In fact, some of the variants feature the same mutation patterns, which suggests that the virus has about reached the limit of productive mutations (i.e., those that increase its infectiousness).^(7)

So why should we expect Covid to disappear when something like the flu stays with us, and even needs annual vaccines? In short, flu and Covid are caused by fundamentally different viruses with different types of genomes. [This](https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1353057276320313344) twitter thread is a fantastic summary of why. In short, flu viruses have genomes composed of 8 pieces that are able to mix and match with each other inside a host. Flu has several different animal hosts that it can reside in, so even when there isn't an epidemic in humans, it is still able to circulate and reassemble itself into a form that our immune system has never seen before. Covid's genome, on the other hand, is a single piece that can only mutate at specific points, and not through an entire reassortment like the flu. This is all to say that empirical evidence suggests immunity is long-lasting, and this is backed up by our understanding of Covid's viral mechanisms. Covid also doesn't freely circulate among several different animal hosts that humans farm, which means the odds of another crossover event after it's eradicated from humans are much lower (this is why we haven't seen a resurgence of the original SARS).

I understand the frustration with people who ignore easy health measures like wearing masks and getting vaccinated. It's also almost certainly true that they have unnecessarily drawn out the pandemic. But to say that they are the reason that we will never get to the end of the pandemic is ignorant of a huge body of scientific work that has been done in the past year which suggests otherwise. As always, we should keep the facts in mind first and foremost even if they may disagree with our preconceptions.

"Bad things a child existing in this world can go through is mental illnesses, loneliness, bullying, school indoctrination, physical disabilities, social development problems, suicide ""irony"", competition, physical pain ""like rolling your ankle etc"", sex, wage slavery, addicted to drugs, debt like college/credit card/etc, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, poverty, wars, politics, famine, murder, rape, sex slave, climate change, global warming, natural disaster ""like hurricanes"", virus pandemics, racism, homophobia, anti straight, any types of cancer, heart disease, peer pressure, getting no sleep, fake friends, judgemental people, insecurities, over/under eating, body composition insecurities, low self esteem, greed, 9 to 5 job you hate, homelessness, child abandonment, child neglect, accidental death, getting judged for being an outcast, regrets, old age, and natural death.

Good things a child existing in this world are having hobbies, interests, real friends, traveling, sex, having girl friend/boyfriend, being loner by choice, working at a job you like, no mental/physical disorders, excellent social skills, debt free, being wealthy, physically in shape, and no regrets etc. 

Notice that I mentioned more cons than pros bringing a child into this world? These are reasons why I dont want to bring a child into this world or reccomend anyone doing in this life. I'm not a dictator and tell people they can't reproduce. Since I know I can't stop everyones intentions to bring a child into this world. Hopefully those parents can prove me wrong and they do whats best for the child, make sure child's happy, parents being financially ready, mentally stable, and good environment for child to not suffer as much in a bad way. The parent needs to be self aware that a child can be a risk because of their selfishness. The child in this society possibly could be average, mentally/physically incapable, evil, or make a good change to contribute into this world. 

The only way to stop this reproduction is to spread the message worldwide and hopefully people can be more understanding that bringing a child in this world has more cons then pros. 

Only way i see reproduction is that it passes on genes for future offspring. Natural selection wipes out people that didnt want to reproduce or were incapable/vulnerable to pass on there genes. Its a pointless meaningless survival mechanism that we as humans are stuck in this suffering existence cycle. 

Hopefully there is a utopia in the future where there is no suffering and reproduction would have more pros then cons to be existing in this world. But that will not exist since bad suffering is inevitable in this world and universe."|Connecticut|2020|True|0
I took a ride down to New Haven today and I didn’t have to pay for any of the buses I took (except for Greyhound). They had us get on on the side doors and the front was blocked off I guess to prevent interactions with the driver. I mean I know it’s all because of the virus and what not but it was just a bit surprising. I took the CT Rail to get back home and I bought a ticket for it but it was never scanned by anyone. So I guess I can reuse it at a late time. Not sure if this is how it is everywhere in the state but I just thought I would mention it!

"About 2 months ago or so, I made a post asking if there was any way I could secretly get a hair cut because barbers/salons were closed. Almost all the comments were ""stay home ! Stop breaking quarantine !!!"" and so forth. Fair enough. We wouldn't want the virus spreading. I was maybe hoping someone would PM me and offer a secret haircut. Luckily my girlfriend cuts my hair now so no problem there.


Yesterday I see a post from a user asking if anyone would like to join a protest because of the recent cop killing a Black dude. Not one person said not to have the protest so we don't have a spike in cases again.


So let me get this straight: you all think it is ok for a large group of people to get together to protest, but god forbid someone wanted a haircut during quarantine ? You all know the virus hasn't disappeared right ? Some states have reopened and their cases have surged:

Our daycare just reopened May 20 with tons of new rules and procedures. I've been lucky to have been able to use sick time mostly through this. I've returned to work part time for the last couple weeks and the grandparents have babysat. My opinion is I think we should return next week. My wife wants to wait another month. We both know by having our child in daycare we'll be at high risk of getting Covid. Only so much daycare can do.  My opinion is this virus will continue to fade and will come back in the fall. Will we shutdown again then too? I see no hope for a vaccine and even if there was one half the country wouldn't take it. Hope for better treatment when contracting virus is my best bet. Everyone has different levels of worriness with this virus. I've looked at as much info as I can to educate myself. I'm much more worried about being in a car accident then my family catching covid19 at this moment, but it's all fun and games until I accidentally kill a grandparent or myself. I'm tired of being scared and my level of acceptable risk seems higher than others. +-6% mortality rate. 80% of people who get Covid don't need hospitalization. Our town has had over 100 deaths, all from nursing homes.  I'm worried that perhaps the cure is worse than the diease. What will there be to save if we can't adapt?

"Dear r/Connecticut,

This is the critical time for the state. As the date reopens, it is treated as a given that [COVID-19 cases will increase](https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-updates-0519-20200519-ifmxjdxw7ncvhh7pu2oh7xbkoy-story.html). As the [article](https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-updates-0519-20200519-ifmxjdxw7ncvhh7pu2oh7xbkoy-story.html) states ""As Connecticut businesses begin to reopen Wednesday and residents leave their homes after months of isolation, the state will likely see an increase in cases, making increased testing and contact tracing crucial to the next steps of curbing the coronavirus, a top health official said Tuesday."" Other states that have reopened early have also experienced and [uptick in cases](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/coronavirus-cases-are-on-the-rise-in-texas-and-other-states-that-reopened-early-former-fda-chief-says.html). Connecticut will be no different.

\- During these next few days and especially this weekend, bars, restaurants, and other gathering places may be crowded with people eager to leave their homes. This is an ideal transmission environment for COVID-19.

\- Complying with wearing a mask is more complex than it looks. There are many [myths](https://www.wlbt.com/2020/05/19/miss-health-experts-debunk-face-mask-myths-swirling-social-media/) about how to wear a face mask on social media. Assume a mask-wearing person you are speaking with does not know how to wear and handle it correctly.

\- Unless there is a medical or physical reason, non-mask wearers are sending you a loud signal: *I have not been fully complying COVID-19 distancing measures.* [Up to 50% of people](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/50-percent-of-people-with-covid19-not-aware-have-virus) infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. People that have been careless with themselves will be careless with you. Assume all non-mask wearers have COVID-19.

\-  When you get in transmissible range of another person, you are indirectly in transmissible range of every other person that individual has interacted with. That person without a mask or sloppy habits has been in contact with dozens, if not a hundred or more, people. You interact with that person, you interact with everyone else they have been in contact with.

You have gotten through this safely so far. Don't be part of the inevitable uptick that is soon to come. Don't throw away all those months of restraint as the virus hopefully wanes and we'll all get through this in one piece. r/Connecticut isn't the same without you, and I hope that all of you, even the trolls, can be safe and healthy during this pandemic."|Connecticut|2020|True|0

"The great thing this virus has done is shown to me the wickedness and real personalities of people. Not just people in power like our city mayors and governors, but it has revealed the real colors of people even close to me. How they snarl at others for protesting their rights, and succumb to the fear cause the tv told them so. They are not aware of the history people like the WHO has been through, the scandals and collusions with pharmaceutical to provide profit. They do not know how widespread the network is of politicians, the medical industry, and even further with interested parties. They don't get that the essential/ non essential mandate is a great contradiction, considering that somehow, their political professions are considered essential while millions are unemployed cause it's for the good of the country. 

In summary, this has brought out the snakes in the grass both in the front yard and the back yard. I hope the population of all countries remember who threw their rights under the bus for a fear-based lockdown. Especially here in Connecticut, every single politician that used this time to choke you beneath control should be voted out of office on their next election cycle, and those you thought were your loved ones but advocated their rights being submitted while damning those who put their freedom over fear...keep a close eye on them for they will be the first ones to stab you in the back if all it takes is fear to make them comply.

"Idaho's Republican governor declared a state of emergency on 03/13/2020 due to the Coronavirus [1]. Among other things, this state of emergency qualified Idaho for medical funding and supplies as well as funding for unemployment. This week the federal government also said that Idaho could extend their unemployment benefits (which were supposed to run out this month) [3].

Article IV, Section 9 of Idaho's constitution specifies that only the governor can call for a special legislative session [4]. In the official call for a special session, the governor specifies that the ONLY things that can be talked [5] about are RS28045 [6], RS28046 [7], and RS28049 [8].

RS28045 will likely limit the in-person voting centers.

RS28046 requires absentee ballots to be mailed out no later than 30 days prior to the election (45 days for military and overseas voters). It also allows counties to begin opening and scanning absentee ballots up to seven days prior to the elections, but no results will be tabulated until the polls close on election day. 

RS28049 provides immunity to persons, businesses, schools, and the government itself from civil liability in regards to the pandemic, as long as there is ""good faith"" to abide by guidelines. The level of ""good faith"" isn't defined so theoretically you could put a ""please wash hands due to pandemic"" sign up and that releases you from all civil liability. Nursing homes acount for over half of Idaho covid deaths [9], and this law would remove all legal incentive for nursing homes to prevent further deaths.

While it would be blatantly illegal and unconstitutional for the legislative branch from discussing anything else, that didn't stop the Idaho House of Representatives from passing HC1 this morning [10]. This bill is a trainwreck of misinformation and bias and would put Idahoan lives in danger and put Idahoans in further financial jeporday..

Lines 19-21 of HC1 paint Idaho Statesman as saying its fine to reopen and lift the state of emergency because ""Idaho Statesman reported on August 20, 2020, that the coronavirus positivity rate in Idaho has dropped for the fourth consecutive week"", making a reference to the fact that Idaho's positive tests are returning at 9.2%. However, the actual article [11] says that Idaho has started testing more, which inherently means more negative results, and that ""Experts say the positivity rate needs to drop below 5% to demonstrate control of an outbreak.""

HC1 also calls for the end of the state of emergency. They say that it is the state of emergency that has caused economic damage as well as physical and mental health deterioration and not the actual virus. Revoking the state f emergency would strip Idaho's eligibility for millions of dollars in federal emergency funds for medical purposes as well as unemployment funding. (Idaho recently qualified for a federal extension would would entitle unemployment recipients to $300 extra per week [12].) People who are on unemployment due to the virus would be kicked off, regardless of if their employers choose to open or not.

Idaho's attorney General has already stated that HC1 ""would carry no legal effect and likely be the subject of a successful legal challenge to its validity."" [13] Minority Leader Michelle Stennett said that ""In court it will cost taxpayers a lot of money. It's not legal.""

The people attending this special hearing have been very tense. The first day right wing protestors shattered a glass door [14]. Several right-wing protestors were unknowingly admitted into a House Judiciary hearing on 08/25/20 with fake press badges. They stood up and were calling people nazis, specifically those who recognized the severity of the pandemic and the need for the state of emergency. One protestor needed to be arrested [15]. Ammon Bundy was in that session as a member of the press and also had to arrest him. [16]

In short,

1. The governor called a special legislative session to discuss 3 bills
2. Those bills dealt with civil liability, absentee voting, and polling places during the pandemic.
3. The Idaho House of Representatives illegally and unconstitutionally passed a bill (that will needlessly cost taxpayers thousands of dollars to take to court) that seeks to put Idahoan lives in further medical and financial jeopardy while also misleading people into a political bias.
4. The right-wing protestors have been violent, disruptive, and several have been arrested.

FYI, this is only day 2.

"With the amount of coughing and hacking I've been hearing echo throughout shopping centres and at my own workplace I've been having trouble believing the 'zero cases in QLD' narrative. Sure it's also flu season so there's no doubt most of the coughing going on isn't anything to be concerned about. However it seems like QLDers especially are quite relaxed when it comes to checking themselves out medically and sticking to rules in general (just take a 20 minute drive and witness the shenanigans). Yes I grew up in QLD and have lived here for 30 years.

Not trying to be a party pooper or anything like that but I'm sure we have many undiagnosed covid cases running around town - probably in inner city areas moreso due to the upper-class arrogance of older boomer Karens & Kens who feel like they have lived through this before and are hesitant to be tested due to a combo of social stigma and 'it's just a flu'.

Sure most cases are mild, but nobody still understands what the longterm internal side effects of this shit will be. I would love for things to get back to normal more than anything else but there's this constant concern in the back of my mind that people in our state are being way too relaxed about things. Of course it's built within our DNA to forget.. otherwise nobody would ever get over a death in the family or a bad break-up so of course after a few months of this we are all guilty of not washing our hands as much as we were back in March.

I guess we will see how things turn out in a few months.. how do you guys feel about this with most restrictions being lifted this weekend?

\*Edit\* 

I guess I didn't make it clear enough and need to clarify that I don't believe we should live in fear of every overheard cough around town - even though the replies are trying to twist the thread in that direction. I am however surprised that people believe that the current numbers are accurate and believe there are no undiagnosed cases (which only supports the idea of QLD having a carefree attitude towards things and disregard testing/covid guidelines) in this state. 

My concern is that we probably have 1000s of undiagnosed cases running around town and with nightclubs opening and further restrictions being lifted this weekend, even though nobody may show any severe symptoms, the disease will still spread undetected due to it's more often than not asymptomatic nature. Most people will think well if there are no symptoms then who cares? Well that's the thing - as mentioned above, we don't know what kind of longterm side effects this junk can produce. Hopefully it's all good - but I feel like these questions are not being considered. So many people hear 'QLD have 0 new cases' day after day on the news when chances are that is far from the truth."|brisbane|2020|True|0

"This is a little bit of a call for help. 

About 2 months ago I got a pretty run of the mill flu. I tested myself for COVID at this time which came back as negative. 

Fast forward a week and at the tail end of my sickness I began experiencing crippling anxiety, panic attacks, issues concentrationing, tingling throughout my arms and legs and a general feeling of malease. 

Over this two month period these symptoms have come and eased 3 times- although have never fully gone away. Two weeks ago my partner complained of similar issues and after recovering once and she is now starting to feel the same way again also ( showing that it seems it is contagious)

"Hey, guys. I've gotten to see the breathtaking views while being a part of this sub. In every way, from my research, New Hampshire just seems like the perfect place for my wife and I. However, you can only find so much on Google.

I live in Indiana now. I'm finishing up college, then saving up to move. My wife and I endure so much bull shit over our gay marriage. A coworker came up to my wife, unprompted, to correct her into calling me her ""partner."" Saying that two women can't be married. Well, we are. So fuck right off. 

We held hands on our way into a restaurant and we got to see one lay drop her jaw, furrow her brows, and start to come after us. So we hurried in. These days I hide my marriage. I was too open about having a wife in school snd have faced problems. None of my coworkers know I'm gay. The only time I mentioned the word ""spouse"" is when people try to get me working nights and I say that I would prefer days so I can spend time with my spouse. It's gotten to a point where I'm just afraid of people. I stood up for us in the past, but Indiana is an ""at will"" state. I don't want to lose my job and I've already had one person make up a lie at school to get me into trouble. Someone told my advisor personally that I had called a professor a homophobe. I knew that prof has a lesbian sister she's close with, and my knowing that information saved my ass. I know I've mentioned the word ""wife"" in clinicals when we were all talking about our spouses. And I've witnessed a nurse turn around and looking fucking enraged at me, dropped jaw and all.

I'm tired of this shit. And I don't want to move to another state where it's either worse or the same. The midwest is also ripe with racism, and I'd like to live somewhere again where people stop being that level of stupid. I was punched in the face by a patient's mom for softly saying I needed to turn the light on. Apparently no staff were allowed to talk because her daughter was sleeping. Security was called, and so were the cops. And I got to hear that woman ""that nasty white bitch"" in her statement. I'm over it. 

All in all, there's just an unnecessary level of animosity with the people vs the people here. What can you resident's of New Hampshire tell me? Feel free to mention the town or city you're in. I know culture can vary in different areas.

And if my post is too offensive I'll take it down.

EDIT: I wasn't expecting so many helpful people to respond! Thank you.

I had originally planned to move to Maine until the heavy impact of the pandemic that MA went through. I loved how beautiful and progressive Vermont looked. It felt like a dream. However, my research said New Hampshire is a hell of a lot more affordable than VT. So I have been researching cost of living and housing, as well as what towns seem to be the safest and most progressive. I know Google can't give me anymore information than what I gathered. So I turned to the residents of NH to try and learn more.

EDIT 2: Sorry for the late catch up, guys. I've been working a lot and it kills my social battery.

I caught up on comments and I went from feeling great about this move to feeling pretty disheartened. There are some people being helpful regarding costs, but I've already moved passed that part of my research and I just needed to make sure we weren't heading into Indiana 2.0. We'll have at least 50k saved up and not debt/loans when we move. We wanted to start out by renting before we bought a house. I know that there isn't a state income tax or sales tax, and that the property tax is high. There was also warning against trying to change the culture upon moving. I have zero interest in moving to another state and changing its culture. I come from a place where everyone wants to be left alone, and people could be pretty cold to outsiders until they proved they made for good neighbors. No one talked about religion in Oregon where I grew up either. I'm chill and just want to be more or less left alone.

We don't want to move to RI or ME. I don't think we'd like the culture of RI, and both are too expensive. ME was my first choice until a lot of people started moving there from New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. My friend in ME said they there are now a ton of cultural problems and expenses just keep going up more and more. He also said there is a lot of religious public practice there, but that no one would care about my wife and I being married.

NH sounded pretty great as far as culture goes. Perfect even. But I guess if it is going to be just as costly as VT there may be no point in moving there. I don't want to struggle, but I also want to get out of where I am. I've been pretty home sick and found NH to be the beautiful climate I'd been missing. I'll check back here in three or four years to see if anything has changed at all.

No car loans, no credit card debt, no student loans, etc. I have disability from the VA to help make up for the extra hours I can't work. I'll have the income, I just didn't discuss it because I wanted to know what the culture is like. And last I had checked, buying a house and making a good living seemed far more difficult in VT.

Hi all, my lease ends at the end of May and I already submitted a notice of nonrenewal (landlord asked for decision super early since she claimed to have an interested party). Was just notified that her rental agent will be giving live showings of the unit I'm occupying for the next 3 months... I'm not very comfortable with the idea of strangers walking throughout my home since I haven't gotten the vaccine yet (still waiting).

Just wondering if there are any restrictions or protections for current tenants in regards to live showings? Am I allowed to request the rental agent to set up a prerecorded virtual tour instead? Lease just says the landlord (or acting agent) can enter and show the unit with a 24-hour notice. I signed a 2-year contract before the pandemic started, so no coronavirus precautions are written in.

I know last year in-person showings were banned when Philadelphia was in the red phase, but I can't find information about any protections that are current and that apply to rentals vs. sales.

Just super anxious about visitors carrying the virus into my home. I have daily allergies that sometimes gets pretty bad, and have been super careful/avoiding outings since last January to avoid potential respiratory issues."|Philadelphia|2021|True|0
"I live in Long Island, NY and can't take living here anymore nor NY all together. I was in between on either moving to Colorado or Tennessee, but I think I'am leaning more towards Nashville. I'm visiting this summer.  I have some questions.

1) How bad is the traffic compared to NYC ? I'm sure it can't be nearly as bad.

2) is there a good nightlife in Nashville besides just country music? I guess I would'nt mind so much but I would rather just go to breweries sometimes, hike, swim in the rivers and go to concerts and see comedy shows.

3) what would the average rent be? (I would say I can probably afford up to 1,100 and i'm also not living with a roommate.

4) How are the people overall? is it easy to met people? Im sick of the ny superficality and all the sports and frat guys and shit. I want easy to meet people and finally date.

I’m so sick and tired of hearing about luxury hotels being built in downtown when there’s a rampant homeless problem in the city, especially when all these multi-million dollar hotels only get fully utilized during Derby Season. Why can’t Louisville invest in high rise affordable housing? Downtown has the potential to grow into a dense urban paradise, and could benefit greatly with having more people in the area. The streets of downtown aren’t any more dangerous than other parts of the city, contrary to what you’d hear from people who live out in the country. More people = more business opportunity, which means a REAL downtown revival. It’s so annoying hearing about “reviving downtown Louisville” and then it’s just an article about a damn hotel.

"So, I work for a certain corporation in the PNW with multiple restaurant, hotels, and bar locations from southern Oregon into Washington. I specifically work for one location in Portland. 

We have had a few confirmed cases of this virus at various locations across the company. Many of us are upset and frustrated about the way it has been handled and I'm trying to figure out if this is normal for Portland/Oregon as a whole.

A few weeks ago, we found out that one location had an employee test positive and was asked to quarantine along with the other employees they had come into contact with. We were then told that our location would be filing shifts the next day after a hazmat team went in and sanitized the restaurant overnight. At the time, we were not told that the reason for this was due to a positive test and only learned of it through rumors and talk amongst employees that worked at that location.

The individual mentioned above has also been updating their Facebook with day by day developments of their illness, and let me say, this person has been absolutely miserable. I feel awful for them and hope they feel better than they are soon. It's been almost three weeks now and this person has finally been fever free for 72-hours and was able to get a doctor's note releasing them back to work. It was said that the only qualifications for their return was 72-hours symptom free and 14-days quarantine. They wanted to be tested for antibodies, so they were given another test to determine if the virus was still active.

While this person was back at their first shift yesterday, they received a notification from their doctor's office stating they were in fact still positive and the person admits in the Facebook post that they still had symptoms (fatigue, headaches, chest pains). They were sent home and by 6pm the restaurant had closed its doors, only because employees did not feel comfortable about working the rest of the day. There are employees who came in for their shift after the employee was sent home that were not informed about what happened just hours before. Things continued on as normal and the staff were unable to get a hold of any higher-ups to figure out what they needed to do. It should be said that this company does not have a plan in place for situations like this so employees were left unsure of what to do and only had the choice to continue like nothing happened. Continue serving customers. Continue filling to-go orders. Employees that had just been working with this person were still on the clock.

Today, I was told that three management level employees had gone into the restaurant to clean. It is unclear if a hazmat team was brought in like before or even if county health officials had been told about this second possibility of exposure in the same restaurant. They are also calling around asking employees at other locations nearby to go fill shifts so this restaurant can stay open today. 

I want to know what everyone has experienced when it comes to co-workers testing positive and what their company or stores or restaurants have done in response and what additional safety measures were put in place, if any. 

Support your local restaurants by ordering your food to-go (those apps suck and it's better to order over the phone directly from the restaurant), tip well because we're putting ourselves at risk for you, wear a mask and wash your hands. Thanks y'all."|Portland|2020|True|1

It will be interesting to see what happens. I think a tunnel deserves more consideration. I wrote a letter to the editor a few months ago that never got published (didn't expect it to), but I figured I'd repost here for discussion. It would be cool if they could come up with an idea that would get the highway off the riverbank.



The Rose Quarter – What if We’re Thinking Too Small?

We are nearing the 60th anniversary of Portland’s downtown freeway loop, and much of it has become functionally obsolete. In the coming decades, one way or another, most of our downtown freeway system will need to be rebuilt. The first installment, ODOT’s (potentially) $1 billion Rose Quarter project, is due to start construction in the next few years. The project has stirred up fierce controversy, centered on freeway caps, exit ramp configurations, sound walls, and countless other details. But so far, a broader discussion of Portland’s freeway system has been missing. ODOT’s environmental assessment of the Rose Quarter project merely states that any changes to the freeway loop are outside the scope of the project, and therefore were not considered in the alternatives. But before we spend that first $1 billion and recommit ourselves to the freeway loop concept, we should stop and ask: Could we do better? Is there a solution that could streamline Portland’s freeway system while also satisfying neighborhood activists? I believe that there is.

Instead of expanding the eastside freeway, a deep-bore tunnel could be built connecting I-84 to US-26 directly. Once completed, the I-5 freeway between the Marquam and Fremont intersections would be decommissioned, and a widened I-405 would become the main north-south route. This would streamline the highway system, with a continuous north-south highway intersecting a continuous east-west highway. The current maze of ramps and out-of-direction travel, with its associated merging chokepoints, would be removed. Such a project would be similar in scope to Seattle’s Big Bertha project, and—full disclosure—it would have a similar price tag ($3.3 billion).

This is higher than the amount set aside for the Rose Quarter; but before dismissing the project as too expensive, consider the following: The Rose Quarter project will merely push the chokepoint from the Rose Quarter to the Marquam bridge. Future projects, with similar price tags, will be required to fully modernize and expand the freeway loop. These should be considered when comparing the alternatives. Although the tunnel option presented here has a higher price tag, it would solve all the chokepoint issues in one go. With slight modifications to lane striping and the closure of the underused Taylor/Salmon ramps, the newly branded I-5 could have three continuous lanes in each direction throughout downtown. I-84 and US-26 would become a single continuous east-west route. Tunnels perform very well in earthquakes (even large, Cascadia level events), so a major east-west tunnel would greatly improve the seismic resiliency of the region. As a final bonus: The Rose Quarter project is projected to cause traffic headaches for five years during construction. A tunnel, on the other hand, could be built with little disruption to current traffic. When viewed from this perspective, the tunnel option begins to look quite attractive. At the very least, it is an alternative that should be considered, not dismissed out-of-hand as “outside of scope.”

Highway skeptics will no doubt argue that a tunnel is not worth the cost. They should consider, however, the benefits to the community. Among them: Renewed access to the Willamette for the South Waterfront area, OMSI, the Central Eastside, the convention center, and the Rose Quarter. The Albina vision, correcting decades-old scars, could be realized in full. Students at Hariett Tubman middle school could safely breathe the air again. The thundering roar of traffic would be removed from Waterfront Park and the Eastbank Esplanade. Taken together, these changes would result in a far more livable and (if done right) equitable Portland.

We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine Portland’s highway system. Currently, we are rushing towards a solution that all sides find unsatisfactory. I believe it’s time to pump the brakes and look at the big picture. If we build the Rose Quarter project now, are we committing ourselves to similarly sized projects in the future? Are we giving up on the dream of a highway-free eastside waterfront? By expanding the time horizon and scope of alternatives, we may find that there are better solutions waiting to be discovered, and we should ask our elected leaders to consider them."|Portland|2020|True|0

I was appalled that urgent care didn't think masks were necessary.  I was disgusted at Costco to find a mother with her preteen daughter coughing up a lung without a mask standing behind me while I bought chicken soup. I was wearing my mask and she gave me a nasty look. People are just gross.

"A year ago I moved into a rental that was a bit rundown but seemed manageable at the time. Then it rained. I woke up one morning to find the carpet soaked but not from a leak, but from morning dew. The humidity in the house was so intense that moisture was literally condensing on the carpet, enough to also make my socks wet. It didn’t matter whether the windows were open or closed, fans on, nothing changed. Then all my furniture started growing mould so I then moved everything into one large bedroom, bought a dehumidifier and lived in my room for two months. The humidity inside was at least 85% permanently. My room 45% with the dehumidifier.

After a month of moving in and living in those conditions I got sick. I reached out to the property manager, explaining the situation. What followed was a frustrating cycle of calls and emails, none of which made any difference. Four months later I was still sick. At this point I was spraying vinegar on the carpet, furniture, and walls weekly to keep the mould at bay. And now my house smelled like vinegar. 

Eventually I’d had enough so I ripped up the carpet myself. All of it and now it's exposed concrete. Within a week my cough was gone. Hooray!! For the first time in months I felt healthy. You’d think that would be the end of it, but no. The landlord finally sent someone to do a mould treatment and all it did was leave a salty residue on the walls not dissimilar to how deodorant feels, that began to attract even more moisture. Now the doors and walls were dripping with condensation literally pulling water straight out of the air and transferring it to all the surfaces. I have photos and videos of just how bad it got, but sharing them would reveal the property. Literally like wiping a foggy shower screen door on every surface I touch. 

So I did what I had to do. I painted the entire house with mould paint and installed an air conditioner, at my own expense to reduce the humidity. After over a year of fighting to make this place liveable, I’ve finally succeeded. The irony is that the house has been in breach of minimum housing standards for over a year which I have now fixed and I wouldn’t be surprised if the rent goes up because of it. 

This is the reality of renting in this market. If you report a problem, you become a difficult tenant and risk being evicted and struggling to find another place. If you stay quiet, you live in unhealthy, unsafe conditions. I actually really like the property and don't want to move. There’s no incentive for landlords or property managers to act unless they’re forced to, breached etc and even then, the system fails tenants. The RTA gives generic advice that leads nowhere, and QCAT is so slow it’s almost useless. It feels like entrapment. If I waited for QCAT I'd still be sick with potentially permanent mould damage to my lungs. 

At this point, I don’t care if I lose my bond. It’s a small price to pay for the improvements I’ve made because my health and quality of life are worth far more. But the fact that I had to do this myself infuriates me. Where are these NEW laws that protect tenants? Why aren’t property managers held accountable for enforcing basic living standards even though they've already come into affect? 

Whenever I share my story the advice is always the same: “Just move out, you can't fix this.” But moving doesn’t fix anything. It just shifts the burden onto the next tenant. I’ve essentially renovated someone else’s house just to make it liveable. And while I’m proud of what I’ve done the injustice is... Well I don't even know how to put it into safe words. 

Landlords and property managers need to do better. Tenants shouldn’t have to choose between their health and their home. Yet here we are, stuck in a broken system that doesn’t care about the people it’s supposed to protect. 

Yeah, I live in Qld, I shouldn't have to move house or buy one just to have a healthy home! "|brisbane|2024|True|0
"Yesterday after struggling to get an appointment, I was told about a place that has walk ins, and I desperately needed to see someone.

Coughing up yellow phlegm, I went into this practice and waited a fair while to see a Dr.

The Dr looks inside my mouth, then tells me that there's nothing wrong with me and I should go home and drink fluids.

I was confused, I responded telling him that I was in pain and I know something is wrong with me.

He looked me in the eye and told me ""I've been doing this thirty years, I know what I'm talking about"".

  
I was shocked, so I went back to reception and explained the situation. The bloke behind the desk made another appointment for me with a different Doctor.

After waiting over an hour, I told the next Doctor what happened, and he looked at my notes, confused as the previous Doctor put in my notes that I was a no show.

He looked inside my throat, and was a bit taken back, ""nah, I don't agree with that, your throat is quite red, it looks really infected"".

I was prescribed anti-biotics and sent home.... but That left me angry, I'm thinking to myself now... how many people does this Doctor do that to? I have an infection, an infection before anti-biotics meant death in a lot of cases. If I didn't go see another Doctor, I was essentially being put in danger by medical negligence. Did he turn me away because of a cultural bias or, what's the go? How many people has he done this to?

How do I go about complaining about this? I asked their receptionist and they said there was an option on the app. There is no complaints section on the app. I feel like there should be some authority to write to about this, as it will all be on my medical notes."|brisbane|2024|True|1

Anyone who visited these venues during the specified periods may have been exposed to the disease and needs to look out for symptoms. The symptoms of measles include high temperatures, cough and a runny nose followed by a red spotty rash and sore, watery eyes a few days later.

Measles is a very infectious disease that is spread by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms usually start 7-10 days after the contact with the infected person but can sometimes take as long as three weeks.

People who have been vaccinated against or previously contracted measles are very unlikely to catch the disease even if they have been exposed.

Those who are at highest risk of contracting measles include people who:

• Were born during or after 1966

• Have no documented evidence of having received 2 doses of a measles containing vaccine

• Have not been infected with measles before

• Have a poor immune system.

If you are unsure of your vaccine status, you can still be vaccinated against measles unless you are pregnant or have problems with a poor immune system. This vaccine is free. Vaccine providers include general practices, many pharmacies and community immunisation clinics provided by Brisbane City Council and Logan City Council.

If you think that you may have measles it is very important that you avoid public spaces and arrange testing with your doctor. Please contact the doctor’s surgery before attending so they can take appropriate precautions. When you call, state that you may have been in contact with a measles case."|brisbane|2024|True|0

Gov. Newsom announced today that all inside activities throughout California are being shut down. The data supports that decision. The pandemic is out of control in our state. The lowest Zorgi Score for any county in southern California is 8.2, but the average is around 13. 

Who are the covidiots?

They are the apolitical people who aren't paying attention, and go to multi-generational parties inside, where the virus loves to propagate. They are young people who think they're invulnerable. The worst of them are the ""political"" types who want to proclaim their allegiance to Trump by refusing to wear a mask or follow elementary precautions. 

So thank you covidiots. Thanks for ruining our economy. Thanks for driving small businesses out of business. Thanks for making a living hell out of the lives of thousands of medical personnel who have to take care of you when you get sick. Thanks for showing us how your selfishness affects not just you, but our entire society.

# Deconstructing county data: San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange County.

 Continuing with my train of thinking from yesterday, today I'm going to dissect the ""Vital Statistics"" Charts from Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. If you're reading this on social media, only the essential charts and tables are shown. To see the rest of them, look at [today's post on my website](https://zorgi.me/?p=1418), zorgi.me. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0x29zy0wrpa51.jpg?width=855&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7077e7440a1f20cbdd2c8f8b815ac2e1ebb985d

 Because cases and tests are on the same linear scale \[CVS3a\], one might not appreciate the 152% increase in cases. Yes, testing has increased significantly, but the positivity rate of 10.4% is still double what it ought to be. And even though testing has ramped up significantly in the last 5 days, there is no guarantee that will continue, especially if national shortages of testing supplies hamper that effort.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q0z041fzrpa51.jpg?width=849&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c036d51946bbfafc16f8d1a74fb489debcf156d

 In Orange \[CVS4a\], daily cases have increased by 366%, while testing has only increased 27%. The real problem here, though, is the positivity rate of 14.1%. That is the highest of the three counties in southern California that publish testing data.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sidtqzy1spa51.jpg?width=854&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e51e73b34e9dd5b2c03deaf268ea18fba1445df4

San Diego's numbers \[CVS7a\] are the best of the three, with a 43% increase in testing. Daily cases doubled, but the positivity rate is only 5.2%, close to the goal for the state. 

One of the reasons California has to go through a partial shutdown again is the increasing number of hospitalizations, less evident in the LA chart, CVS3b, than in the data from other counties.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aonlj916spa51.jpg?width=849&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11e7ec859ae1134d151b8bdd2ce9b1c8a3c3e97e

 LA's daily hospital number increased by 44%, but in other counties, it was far higher: Kern, 150%; Orange, 101%; Riverside, 111%; San Bernardino, 141%; San Luis Obispo, 120%; and Santa Barbara, 170%. LA's HUR is a relatively low 12%, but the IUR is now 32%. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uv0q00b9spa51.jpg?width=851&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62d471651428c6f1ebc1051d7312fb0c34dfd398

 Orange is still at a 10% HUR \[CVS4b\], but daily patients have gone steadily upward, as has the IUR. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9y5vnu9cspa51.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3625fed98558fc0ff95c43bb435d7c518eced7f

 San Diego's hospitalization numbers \[CVS7b\] are quite a bit more reassuring. While the IUR is up to 35%, it hasn't risen a great deal over the past month. Hospital patients have gone from around 350 to 460, but the HUR has held pretty steady at a low 7%. ICU patients have only increased slightly, from around 150 to 170.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v8ilcvrespa51.jpg?width=860&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfcbeaeab1a9a7f09c6c3780c15652a06a573e16

  

CVS3c shows an alarming increase in daily fatalities since July 4, a doubling in one week. This is a 7 day moving average, so we're not just looking at noise from a single day. The CFR, which had gone down to 1.1%, also doubled in a week to 2.2%. The increase was also reflected in the ICU Fatality ratio, which jumped from 3.9% to 6.6%. As I explained yesterday, I call this a ""ratio"" rather than a ""rate"" because I do not want to imply that this is the rate of ICU patients that die. It simply shows a correlation.

The one good piece of news in the LA chart is that doubling days have gone from 22 days to 54 days, well out of the danger zone.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y05yt8xhspa51.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f4b2405b986fdba5be0ba6c3f853910c8c56368

Orange County's daily fatality rate \[CVS4c\] has doubled, but we're not talking about large numbers - yet. This may change, because the fatality doubling day rate has plateaued at 27 days, so if it doesn't change, by next month at this time, we'll be looking at 4 to 6 fatalities a day. One positive trend is that the CFR has dropped to only 1%. 

https://preview.redd.it/rgxtp7ukspa51.jpg?width=852&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50f833669f2b340b81bc5e4a883db483ef265da1

The one concerning aspect of San Diego's situation \[CVS7c\] is the daily fatality number, which has gone from zero one month ago to 5 per day now. As in O.C., the CFR is a low 1.1%. Unlike O.C., though, the doubling days continue to climb, from around 35 days to 54 days.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pwqrgginspa51.jpg?width=788&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b83a8973afca8b1ad7ca060705d340571bcce92b

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yqk38a6pspa51.jpg?width=995&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=956e89bb52a428eab14293b5ebc67f0e948c92e9

 It should be apparent why San Diego has a lower Zorgi Score than LA or OC. OC fared worse than LA primarily for its increase in daily cases and the drop in doubling days, where they went down 41%, compared to LA's increase of 10%.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2a98k81sspa51.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06415f61a9666f371a3e15fe39e7712750b030c1

 The state Zorgi Scores \[SDT1\] demonstrate the bad situation in CA, but the far worse one in AZ, FL, NV, and TX, where the pandemic is out of control. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1d82yjuspa51.jpg?width=831&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b16ea0a04a36691a40571fdd4bf5b997ba98c992

The city Zorgi Scores for SD County \[CY1\] have Carlsbad leading the pack. Carlsbad mirrors Orange County in some ways -- higher income, with lots of people who mistakenly believe they're immune to the virus or who want to prove how tough they are by not wearing a mask. Consequently, they end up with some of the worst daily case rates in the county. 

I'd like to do a city/neighborhood analysis for L.A., but still haven't been able to find a source with historical data and an API that will allow download for a specific set of neighborhoods/cities and a single date. I've communicated with C.J., a person like me to took it upon themselves to do this, but had to give up because of the inconsistencies in reporting from the public health dept. So, if anyone has a source that will require **zero** manual input on my side, please let me know.

I'm still working on a couple of projects: first, I'm well along in the SD County zip code analysis. I now will track 33 zip codes in SD County instead of 31, because I forgot San Ysidro and Otay Mesa (duh!). I should have Zorgi Scoring for that level in a day or so. 

Secondly, I'm working on a commentary about public education. If you are a teacher or work in the public schools, I encourage you to DM me, or email me at zorgi@zorgi.me. 

Stay healthy, be well, and wear that mask!

"# Oops! JULY 10, not June 10. Sorry!

More and more articles are coming out documenting the harassment and threatening behavior ~~essential~~ expendable retail workers have to endure every day. We’ve all heard about the Starbucks employee who got $100,000 in case after a video of a Karen berating him went viral. But the vast majority of retail workers subjected to this behavior get nothing.

The other day, I talked to a grocery worker at Gelson’s. I asked him if he ever had any problems with customers. He rolled his eyes. “Every day,” he said, “at least three times a day.” At Gelson’s they enforce the rules. At other stores, not so much.

The Times of San Diego in [a good article](https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2020/07/09/workers-rip-ralphs-vons-and-albertsons-hero-pay-gone-no-mask-enforcement/) on the subject, reprinted a letter from UFCW Local 135 President Todd Walters, which outlined just how dire the situation for their workers is. He pointed out how workers no longer received sick leave or hazard pay, and how employers are no longer enforcing mask and social distancing regulations.

There are three parties to blame here:

* State and federal officials who don’t take this pandemic seriously and refuse to make it mandatory to wear masks
* Employers who want to “please every customer” by not enforcing regulations
* Anti-maskers who assert their privilege, almost always white privilege, by attacking retail workers for trying to protect the public.

It’s pretty obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that Trump doesn’t care about the pandemic and wishes it would just go away. Same for his obsequious minions, from senators to members of county boards and city councils. These toadies must be voted out at every level in the next election. It doesn’t do any good to write letters to them. Instead, spend your time trying to reach voters who didn’t care about voting last election, or voters who just registered. Explain to them how their lives literally depend on the outcome of this next election.

The second group, employers, are making a grievous error if they think they’ll make all customers happy by trying to make all customers happy. I don’t think I’m the only person in an “at risk” group who pays very close attention to the level of compliance with mask wearing and social distancing at every retail establishment I go to. TJ’s and Gelson’s so far have done a good job. Von’s – you are no longer getting my money. Neither are you, Home Depot. This isn’t a political boycott; it’s a safety measure.

Finally, what about the anti-maskers who have no compunctions about making themselves physical and political superspreaders? Store owners must take the lead here. We’ve all seen the sign, “No shoes, no service.” They enforce that. Masks should be no different. And they should not put the burden of enforcement on retail employees. Employees should be encouraged not to service people who refuse to wear a mask. Belligerent anti-maskers should be escorted out.

As for the anti-maskers, how incredibly selfish can you get? You think you’re upholding some political principle? No. The only thing you’re upholding is ignorance in the face of science. In a dream world, you would be hauled into court, fined $1,000, and sentenced to a week of 16 hour a day shifts in one of the ICU units where health care workers have to risk their lives to take care of your sorry, miserable selves.

On the other hand, we who believe in science need to apply it as well. We don’t need to yell at someone without a mask walking their dog in the neighborhood who’s 30 feet away. Don’t follow a bicyclist in your car because you saw them riding without a mask. Don’t lose your cool with anti-maskers. Stay calm.

I have to tell myself that over and over, because I get as mad as anyone else when I think about all the unnecessary nonsense we’re being forced to go through because of political leaders who refuse to listen to public health experts.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*\[ Note to my L.A. readers: I realize this next section may not be of much interest to you. But if you know of a source for data on LA cities and/or neighborhoods, and the data has an API so I can download it, and you would like to see this in my LA updates, then please give me a link! \]*

I’ve been working hard on redoing the city level analysis, and I’m just about finished. I still will probably tinker with the Zorgi Scores, but I think I’m pretty close. My aim was to produce an overall Zorgi Score for all 19 cities that was reflective of the score for the county as a whole. On July 7, SD County had a score of 8.2. If you look on CY0, you’ll see that the average for all the cities is 8.1 — not bad.

I’m well aware that there aren’t many metrics to base the score on, and that they all revolve around one thing – cases. Still, that can be a worthwhile thing to examine. So the city level score, and the zip code level score when I finish with it, is based on the following four metrics:

* Percentage change in total cases during the period
* Prevalence index at the end of the period
* Percentage change in daily cases
* Percentage change in case doubling days

I’m still writing up the rationale for the metrics and exactly how each of the 4 component scores is calculated, and when I finish, you can go through it on [my web page](https://zorgi.me/covid-19-resources/zorgi-score-calculations/).

Once again, the Zorgi Score made me question my assumptions prior to running the calculation program. For example, I just took it for granted that the highest scores would be in South Bay. Imagine my surprise when the bar for Carlsbad popped out there. Then I looked at the four parts of the score: total cases, up by 217%; prevalence index at 424 – not bad, but then they didn’t get dinged very badly for that either; change in daily cases – up 811%; and change in doubling days – down 58%, to a very bad 13 days.

Should National City really be at 4.6?

Their total cases increased by 81%, one of the lowest rises of all the cities. The prevalence index was 78, which is quite low, and they did get 2.0 points for that. Daily cases were up 145%, for which they got 1.6 points, but that was one of the lower increases. Finally, aside from Poway, they were the only city to increase their case doubling days, in this case from 32 days to 62 days, a 94% change. So 4.6 seems like a reasonable score.

This is the sort of analysis you can do yourself for all the cities. If a city seems high to you, go through the components of the score and examine whether it’s justified. And by all means, if you think I’ve really flubbed on something here, let me know.

But please don’t argue with me about the concept of the Zorgi Score itself. I know there are some of you who hate it. As I keep saying though, it’s not an epidemiogical tool or a forecasting model. It’s an analysis tool, a catalyst to ask why.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My regular readers know I stay away from predictions. But I’m going to make one here. I predict that in 3 weeks, the Trump team will no longer be bragging about the death rate. They might even stop talking about it next week. All over the country, hospitals are filling up, and many of the beds are occupied by young people. The more those beds fill up, the higher the death rate is going to go, no matter how much progress we’ve made in fighting the virus.

I may take a break tomorrow. If I do, I’ll be back on Sunday. Have a safe and healthy weekend, everyone!

***Current Events Commentary***

In Oklahoma, Trump told his audience that he asked his staff to cut down on testing. Around the country, epidemiologists, along with those who care for the people who are sick and dying from COVID-19, were outraged. The next day, Peter Navarro claimed this was one of Trump’s jokes. Trump though, said this: “I don’t kid. Let me just tell you. . . I say it all the time. I know some people thought it was tongue-in-cheek.”

Today, the European Union considered measures to be taken in order to reopen their economies on July 1. One of these measures is a ban on nations that have done exceptionally poorly in handling the pandemic. The U.S., along with Russia and Brazil. 

For a couple of years, we were the laughing stock of the world. Now we are the object of pity, and deemed too dangerous to be allowed into Europe. 

**E2** shows how we compare to the six other countries on a per million people basis. There’s the U.S., at 7,226 cases. Second is Sweden, the country covid-deniers here sought to make a model, with 5,947 cases. Brazil is zooming upward with 5,496 cases. Two countries that have flattened the line almost completely are Denmark and Germany, at around 2,300 cases. 

**E3** tells the same story with daily new cases per 1M. Brazil leads the pack with 152 per day, followed by Sweden with 105, and then the US with 89. And Denmark and Germany: they’re both at 8. 

Apologists for Trump may try to persuade us that these are just cases, that we look so bad because we test so much. If that were the case, then our fatality rate would be quite low. But as **E6**, shows, the U.S. is right there with Brazil and Mexico in daily fatalities: Brazil at 1,045, the U.S. at 652, and Mexico at 558. Germany is now around 10 per day. And Denmark? They had a slight uptick over the past two days -- from 0 to 1. 

Over the past few month, I’ve encountered a few Trumpsters who bemoan my mixing of politics and pandemics. They urge me to put a wall between them. That might be a reasonable request in Italy or Germany, where liberals and conservatives alike follow public health officials and science, resulting in containment of the virus.

But here we have a president who not only refuses to endorse the most minimal of public health initiatives like wearing masks, but actively engages in creating potential super-spreader events in heavily affected states like Oklahoma and Arizona. 

**Data Commentary**

I’m going to keep the rest of my  comments about county data short today. I’m still trying to complete the data reorganization I mentioned when I posted the new county data a couple of days ago.

On **VS2**, it’s good to see LA and SD counties over 30 doubling days for cases at 37 days for SD and 31 days for LA. Orange, Riverside, Kern, and Ventura are still under 30 days, meaning that before the end of July, Orange may have over 20,000 cases compared to the 10,563 it has today. 

**VS3** visually conveys a sense that things are bad as far as cases, but better as far as fatalities. Daily cases, for example, are in the red across the board. However, we have to keep reminding ourselves that fatalities are a lagging indicator, so if case metrics look bad today, fatalities may very well follow that course in 2 to 3 weeks. 

That’s it for today. I realize things are a bit hap-hazard on my end. I hope to complete my reorganization in about a week, and everything should look much more organized then.

Stay safe and healthy, everyone!

"By personal observation and report elsewhere, mask use on the streets is falling well, below 50%.  Coincidentally, cases are growing exponentially again.  *Hmm*.

Cases of a disease that kills many, cripples more, and doesn't seem to play well with acquired immunity.  Even if you're 20 years old with a low chance of dying (""low"", 1 in a 1000?), there's still a high risk of long term lung and heart damage; you might not feel 20 when (if) you recover.  And then you might get it again.  Worse the second time, if the cytokine storm idea is right.

When can we stop wearing masks?  Possibly never, or not until the equivalent of retroviral drugs for AIDS are developed.  **Pandemics change history**. And they usually don't just go away, we need to do something.  New vaccines, new drugs, or people wearing masks and avoiding indoor crowds until every last pocket of virus globally has gone away.

Masks and Japan, which never had a proper lockdown but has low rates due to a culture of ""I might be sick, I should wear a mask to protect other people."" https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelrush/2020/06/22/mask-use-still-widespread-in-slowly-reopening-japan-as-coronavirus-cases-remain-low/

Edit: it's CDC advice https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html

" Sorry I missed an update yesterday; it’s the first day I didn’t post since March 28, and I figured a day off for Father’s Day was a necessary thing. 

The reorganization of the way I present state data was a success judging from all the terrific comments I got on several subs. So I’m trying to apply the same methodology to counties, and work my way down. 

One of the striking things about this pandemic is that there is no “national” outbreak. Each locality has its own characteristics. That makes it not as useful to compare one state with another, and it starts to make more sense to look at each state in light of its own metrics.

The same is true, it turns out, with counties in California. Previously, I covered counties all over the state, with an eye to comparing them. I’ve decided to change my approach, and concentrate on counties just in Southern California, the thinking being that while the “anchor” subs I post in are San Diego and Los Angeles, people travel to and from all the counties in the region. 

The counties I’ll be covering from now on are: Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura. 

This has required a complete reorganization of my spreadsheets, as well as the creation of new charts. I’m about halfway done, so I hope you’ll bear with me over the next week or so while I get everything back in good order.

One thing that is extremely aggravating is the lack of data available. I can download data for cases, fatalities, patients, and ICU with no problem. Beyond that, it’s a mess. Only three of these counties publish testing data: Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego. Yet one of the big metrics public health officials keep talking about is the Positivity Rate - the ratio of cases to tests. How is anyone supposed to calculate that without having access to testing data? They say that transparency is essential during a pandemic. As good as California has done in many respects, we still have a long way to go. 

Hospital bed availability and utilization rates are another metric that virtually everyone agrees is important. Try getting these stats. You’ll see that I’ve included a hospital bed utilization rate (HUR) and an ICU utilization rate (IUR) for each county. There is no easy way to get up to date data. I was able to find a source for ICU utilization rates before the pandemic, but for HUR’s, I had to make an estimate of 65% for every county but San Diego.

When you see the HUR and the IUR on a chart, that includes the HUR and IUR for COVID only, PLUS the pre-pandemic HUR and IUR. I did this to give a better visual of how close a county is to maxing out on its healthcare system. I realize this is nothing more than an estimate, but I thought it might be more useful that just showing the COVID HUR and IUR alone.

Some counties, like Imperial, have a very low death count in absolute numbers (even though its rising quickly), so I provided another metric that shows up the chart - a 7 day fatality count. This is a rolling 7 day SUM of the fatalities for the previous week; it is not a daily count. 

Since so many of the counties lack data on testing, making it impossible to show a positivity rate, for those I added case doubling days and fatality doubling days to help complete the picture of what’s going on.

I’ll provide a “Z-score” for each county, on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 signifying the least risk and 10 signifying extreme risk. I’m sure you realize that this is a totally subjective assessment. Also, it’s not a grade on how the county is doing.

The charts with today’s update are:

* CVS0 - Z-scores for counties
* CVS1 - Imperial County Vital Statistics
* CVS2 - Kern County Vital Statistics
* CVS3 - LA County Vital Statistics
* CVS4 - Orange County Vital Statistics
* CVS7 - San Diego County Vital Statistics
* CGS1 - Daily Cases per 1M People
* CGS2 - Daily Fatalities, 7 Day Avg.
* CGS3 - Daily Fatalities per !M People,
* CGS4 - Prevalence Index
* Analysis - screenshot of the numbers used for data commentary
* County Info on hospital stats + sources
* VS3 - Southern California Snapshot
* VS1 - Vital Statistics, San Diego Are (SD Only)

**Data Commentary**

The following commentary is based on a starting date of May 20 and an ending date of June 20. Whenever I refer to “the beginning” or “at the start” that means May 20. Please refer to the “Analysis” chart if you would like to check the numbers.

**Imperial County - see CVS1**

This is a county where a lot of people are struggling to get by. The average median value of owner occupied housing for the 10 SoCal counties is $438,840; the median value in Imperial is $177,100. 62.4% of the population is non-white. There are lots of farm workers who work in the county, but can’t afford to live there, so they go back and forth between Mexico and the US every day. Mexico is not faring well in the pandemic, so this naturally affects the situation in Imperial. 

Cases have jumped by 122% over the last month. Since testing data isn’t available, there is no way to assess it’s impact on case expansion. Case doubling days have increased by 90%, from 10 days to 19 days. The fatality doubling rate decreased, which is a very bad thing, from 15 days to 14 days and fatalities per 1M have increased by 425% in the past month. Since absolute number are still quite low, less than 1 a day, that isn’t as worrisome as it would be in LA. The real worry hear is that ICU beds are in short supply, and my estimate is that the IUR a month ago was 115% and is now 107%. I don’t think this is far off the mark, because we’ve had continual reports of overflow patients from Imperial going to surrounding counties. 

*Z-score for Imperial County:  7.5 out of 10*

**Kern County - see CVS2**

Kern has seen even more of an increase in cases than Imperial - 140%, from 36 cases a day to 85 cases a day. Again, we have no testing data, so we have to rely on other metrics. Case doubling days have only risen by one day, from 25 to 26 days, so case growth isn’t slowing down much at all. Fortunately, fatality doubling days have gone up, from 15 to 27 days, and daily fatalities have stayed exactly even. 

Hospitalizations have increased by 107%, from 56 to 116, bringing the HUR at the end of the period to 73% - up there, but nothing like Imperial. The IUR went from 63% to 75%, but there is still capacity remaining. 

*Z-score for Kern County:  5 out of 10*

**Los Angeles County - see CVS3**

LA is one of the three counties that provide testing data, so we can use the positivity rate as a metric. Daily cases increased from 908 to 1,381, or 52%. That was the smallest rise of all ten counties. The positivity rate jumped, but that may be just a two day aberration, since it had been holding steady at around 7% for quite a while. Testing only went up 9% from 11,494 to 12,510 a day, a 9% increase. That means that a maximum of 71.6% of the increase in cases could theoretically be tied to testing increases. \[Please note the word theoretically. I am not saying testing created these cases or was responsible for them. This only means that if you were to use the argument that the increase in cases was due to testing, that would only explain 71.6%, even if every single case came from a new test\] Looking at it another way, if cases stayed the same, with the testing changes, we would have had a maximum positivity rate of 7.4%. Since it was 11.0%, that means new sick people are showing up. 

Fortunately, the HUR decreased, from 75% to 74%, reflecting a 5% drop in hospitalizations, from 2,067 to 1,969. Daily fatalities also decreased from 44.4 to 31.4 - a drop of 29%. That’s a very good sign. 

*Z-score for Los Angeles County:  3.5 out of 10*

**Orange County - see CVS4**

Another county providing testing data. Here we have double the increase in cases - 102% - that LA had, from 120 a day to 243 per day. Testing did increase from 2,533 per day to 3,758 per day, a 48% increase. That means the maximum theoretical increase from testing would be 73.3% of the new cases. If cases had remained the same, the positivity rate at the end of the period would have been 3.2%. Instead, it was 6.5%. So there are some clear indications that cases are starting to multiply on their own. This is reflected in the daily fatalities which increased by 178%, from 2.6 per to 7.1. 

Hospitalizations also went up, from 388 to 446, bringing the final HUR from 71% to 72%. There’s still room for growth there, but less so in ICU’s. There was a 28% increase in ICU’s, from 130 to 167, bringing the final IUR to 81%, getting a little close for comfort.

*Z-score for Orange County:  6.0 out of 10*

**San Diego County - see CVS4**

The third and last county providing testing data. Here we’ve had one of the lowest increases in cases, only 36%, resulting from cases going from 123 a day to 167. Case doubling days went up by a healthy 10 days, from 29 days to 39. The increase in fatality doubling days was even better - from 26 days to 45 days. Testing increased by 65%, from 3,246 to 5,349. And yes, you could theoretically say that all the new cases came from more testing.

Again, I’m pretty sure they didn’t, but this is the only one of the five counties covered today where one could even make a half credible argument for that.

There was also a nice drop in hospitalizations, from 404 to 330 per day, a change of negative 21%, bringing the HUR to the lowest of all ten counties, 55%. ICU dropped slightly as well, from 150 to 148, resulting in a final IUR of 85%. 

*Z-score for San Diego County:  3.0 out of 10*

The remaining five counties will be covered in the next couple of days. None of them provide testing data, so the analysis will all be like that for Imperial and Kern.

Some last thoughts on the county comparison charts - CGS1, 2, 3, & 4. CGS1 shows the outsized proportion Imperial’s cases are having on the situation. Numbers are not huge yet, but on a normalizd basis, Imperial is taking up much more space than any other county, including LA. 

If you look at daily fatalities in terms of absolute numbers, as in CGS2, LA county clearly is huge. But as soon as you normalize the numbers, just as in CGS1, Imperial County in CGS3 dominates the landscape. Even more worrying is the steepness of the increase. It’s clearly an area where significant problems could develop very quickly. 

The Prevalence index of 42 for Imperial is the lowest number I’ve seen for any locality I’ve tracked. Even in LA, where there have been thousands and thousands of cases, the prevalence index is five times that of Imperial. How worried would you be if one out of every 42 people in your county had direct experience with CV19? I’m pretty sure you wouldn’t be out there protesting that wearing a mask was a “deep state plot.”

I’ve included the other “Vital Statistics” tables just to keep you updated, but commentary on that will have to wait.

By the way, today I again got a Trumper “calling me out” on my political bias and telling me I had “Trump Derangement Syndrome.” If you’re a TrumpTroll, save your energy and either skip my posts altogether or just read the data section. 

Stay safe and healthy, everyone!

"I’ve made no secret of my disdain for clickbait headlines like “Highest number of cases ever! 37% increase from previous day!” I have two objections. First, they use statistical noise to generate a headline. Second, they oversimplify the real situation in any state. The result is that those who want to claim that cases increased just because of testing make their argument, picking out a single statistic. “Look, we increased testing by 97%. Of course cases increased!” And the person who thinks that doesn’t tell the whole story is left with nothing to say. 

Pandemics are complex. You can’t reduce them to a single number. Yes, some metrics are more important than others, and at different stages in the pandemic. But all the crucial metrics operate and move together, and it’s through an analysis of that movement that we gain an understanding of what the real situation is in any state. 

I’ve looked at a whole lot of metrics over the past few months, and for me, the most important are:

* Daily case counts, 7 day moving average
* Daily fatality counts, 7 day moving average
* Daily test counts, 7 day moving average
* Positivity rate by day:  daily cases / daily tests
* Rt, the effective transmission rate
* Daily hospital patients, 7 day moving average
* Hospital utilization rate (HUR)
* Daily ICU patients, 7 day moving average
* ICU utilization rate (IUR)

I’ve created charts that, where possible, display all of these metrics. Some states don’t report patient numbers or ICU numbers, and some just don’t report ICU numbers. Those metrics for those states are left off the charts.

The states I selected are some of the ones I’ve been tracking all along: Florida, Georgia, Texas, and California. I’ve added three new states: Oklahoma, because I want to track the effects, if any, of the MAGA rally in Tulsa on June 20;  and Arizona and Nevada, because they’re our neighbors and as we open up, there will be a LOT of travel between those states and ours. As many have pointed out, viruses don’t care about borders.

These are most definitely not TL;DR charts. They’ll take a bit of concentration, but hopefully it will be worth it. 

Along with the charts, I’ve included a section from my spreadsheet that has an analysis of the changes over the course of the last month, from May 19th to June 19th. The section on each state will refer primarily to the numbers on that table. Whenever I use “started with” or “at the start”, etc., I am referring to 5/19. Whenever I use “ended with” I’m referring to 6/19.

I’ve also given each state a “grade” from A to F, based on how it did with all these metrics. I don’t grade on a curve (lol) but I would reserve an “A” for a state that was really defeating the virus, and “F” for a state that appears to be headed for disaster. 

At the end of this discussion, there’s a section on definitions and methods.

**Arizona - ST1**

Cases increased by 387%, from 404 per day to 1,967. Simultaneously, testing increased by 109%. If the daily case number stayed the same, we would expect that increase in testing to drop the case positivity rate to 3.5%, from 7.3% on 5/19. But it went in the opposite direction. The case positivity rate is now 17.0%. If we take the 1,967 cases today, we would expect increased testing to account for 845 of them, or 43% of the total. That leaves 1,122 cases that have nothing to do with the testing increase, or 57% of the total. 

Most of the other metrics don’t look very good either. Daily fatalities increased by 18%. Hospitalizations increased by 97%. The HUR doubled, from 6% to 12%. ICU patients increased by 61%. Finally, Rt went from 1.22 to 1.32, a significant change in the wrong direction. 

Arizona’s Grade:   **D+**

**California - ST2**

Cases increased by 89%, from 1,773 to 3,348. Testing only wend up by 61%, from 43,707 to 70,492. However, the increase in testing accounted for 85.4% of the case increase. The positivity rate went up only slightly, from 4.1% to 4.7%. If the cases per day had stayed the same throughout the month, the positivity rate from the increased testing would have dropped from 4.1% to 2.5%. Daily fatalities decreased from 70 to 60, a 14% decrease, the one unequivocal bright spot in California’s metrics.

Hospitalizations basically stayed the same going from 4,455 to 4,488, with an HUR of 6%. ICU patients went up very slightly, from 1,314 to 1,329. The IUR for California is 18.6%. Finally, the Rt went from 1.02 to 1.03, not great, but not a huge change, either. 

California’s Grade:   **B-**

**Florida - ST3**

Florida doesn’t report on ICU’s, so that’s missing from this section.

Cases increased by 274%, from 717 to 2,682. Testing went up from 19,464 to 28,139, a 45% increase. Only 38.7% of the increase in cases could theoretically be attributed to testing increases. Positivity rates went from 3.7% to 9.5%, a very hefty increase. If cases per day had remained the same, the increase in testing would have reduced the positivity rate to 2.5%. 

Hospitalizations actually decreased from 1,007 to 874, a -13% change. The HUR has remained stable at 4%, nothing to get particularly worried about. Rt went from 1.14 to 1.3. The end of period Rt is not good at all; it indicates some serious trouble ahead.

Florida’s Grade:   **C-**

**Georgia - ST4**

Cases increased from 584 to 889, a 52% increase. Testing dropped by 32%, from 16,568 to 11,193. As the chart shows, the testing situation in Georgia is a complete mess, and there was no way to make it look prettier on the chart either. With a decrease in testing, we would expect an increase in the positivity rate, and we got it: from 3.5% to 7.9%. However, if cases remained stable, we would expect the drop in testing to raise the positivity rate to 5.2%. Since it went up by 2.5% more than that, there are some serious issues in Georgia. No improvement in the fatality rate, either. It went from 29 to 31, a 7% increase. 

The one bright spot here is that hospitalizations dropped from  448 to 352, a -21% change. The overall situation also improved, as indicated in the drop for Rt, from 1.08 to 1.05.

Georgia’s Grade:   **C**

**Nevada - ST5**

A 146% increase brought Nevada’s daily case count from 105 to 258. Testing improved by 49%, from 3,354 to 4,988. Increased testing accounted for a theoretical increase in cases of 60.4%. If cases had remained stable, the positivity rate would have gone from 3.1% to 2.1%. Instead, the positivity rate increased from 3.1% to 5.2%. A real bright spot in Nevada’s situation was the decrease in fatalities, from 8 to 2, a 70% decrease. 

Hospitalizations remained basically stable, going from 179 to 173, a 3% drop. The HUR stayed the same at 2%. ICU patients also dropped, from 112 to 87, a change of -22%. The Rt, however, increased from 1.08 to 1.22.

Nevada’s Grade:   **C**

**Oklahoma - ST6**

The state went from 108 cases to 265, a 145% increase. Testing dropped, from 6,148 to 4,052, or down by 34%. Not good. The positivity rate naturally increased, from 1.8% to 6.6%. Had cases stayed the same, we would expect the positivity rate to increase to only 2.7%, so that means a lot more sick people are coming into the hospitals. The number of daily fatalities is so small - 2 at start, 1 at the end -- that the decrease isn’t significant. 

Hospitalizations increased by 57% the largest increase of any of the states except Arizona, going from 1,661 to 2,609. This caused the HUR to rise from 3% to 4%, still well below the danger zone. Rt went up significantly, from 1.09 to 1.20.

Oklahoma’s Grade:   **C-**

**Texas - ST7**

Texas had a 121% increase in cases from 1,266 to 2,804. Testing only increased by 22%, from 23,139 to 28,137. That means that testing increases accounted for a theoretical increase in cases of 55%, or 1,264 of the 2,804 cases today. The positivity rate almost doubled, from 5.5% to 10.0%. If cases had remained the same, the positivity rate today would be 4.5%. Good news for Texas, though: the fatality rate dropped by 15%, from 34 to 29.

Since Texas doesn’t report any hospitalization data, all we have left is Rt, which increased from 1.06 to 1.12

Texas’s Grade:   **C+**

In addition to the summary of changes, there’s a table showing the effects of Rt over the course of 7 weeks. This is not meant to be a sophisticated model of any kind. It assumes an average incubation period of 7 days. That means, for example, if the Rt is 1.2, after one week, there will be 2.2 people infected - the original sick person, plus 1.2 more people. By week 2, these 2.2 people will have gone on to infect 1.2 people each, so that now there will be 4.84 people infected. By the end of the 7th week, there would be 249 people infected.

And yes, I know that someone infected gets better or dies; they don’t just stay in the numbers. But I’ll just quote from the very valuable site developed by Kevin Systrom, the originator of Instagram, and Thomas Vladeck at rt.live:  

“Rt, \[is\] a key measure of how fast the virus is growing. It’s the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. If Rt is above 1.0, the virus will spread quickly. When Rt is below 1.0, the virus will stop spreading.”

At an Rt of 1, provided there is an adequate infrastructure of testing, tracing, and isolation, a pandemic can be contained. The higher Rt rises, the less that infrastructure can keep up. 

I’ve provided the regular snapshots for our region, but no commentary on those today -- my fingers are tired!

Stay well and healthy, everyone!

And if you went to the Trump rally in Tulsa, please quarantine yourself for at least 538 days!

**Housekeeping**

I’ve added to the FAQ’s. FAQ #2 now has an explanation of the Prevalence Index. FAQ #3 has an explanation of the hospital utilization charts, which you’ll see today for the first time. It also has an explanation of the colors and range limits used on the snapshot table for Southern California \[VS3\]. Snapshot #4 has sources and notes, including sources for hospitalization data. Common definitions are now on FAQ #4. I’ll post these FAQ’s with every update. If you have any questions about the charts or calculations, please look at the FAQ’s first; your answer might be there.

Also, I wanted to clear up something about the links to the raw data and the charts. These links are to url’s created by Google for published spreadsheets. They are not user friendly. There’s no navigation, no row numbers, and they load very slowly. They are there strictly for those who would like to see the raw data and what is there. Please don’t draw any conclusions from those links about how I do my updates, though. They are just crude windows into the raw data, nothing more.

About the Hospitalization Charts - CH1 - CH6

You may have guessed the theme of this update: hospital data. Since the charts here are new, I’m going to explain them as best I can.

I get 4 pieces of data form the CA DHHS: patients confirmed, patients suspected, ICU confirmed, and ICU suspected. The numbers are for that day only; they are not cumulative, and I have no way to get those numbers. The ICU numbers are included in the “patient” numbers.

I combine the confirmed and suspected into a single number for “hospitalized” and the confirmed and suspected ICU into “ICU”. Then I do a 7 day moving average to smooth out the noise from day to day.

Why do we care about hospitalization numbers? Because we all saw what happened in NY, when hospitals got overwhelmed. Once that happens, the entire health care system is effectively shut down, and that is a disaster, resulting in more lives lost, not just from CV19, but from other medical emergencies that can no longer be handled.

So bed utilization rates are critical. Sadly, there are no easily accessible statistics on this. We all know that the number of licensed hospital beds and ICU beds can vary from week to week, but there’s no way to keep track of that. So I had to use static numbers from the CA Hospital Assn. and KPBS. From these sources, I got licensed hospital beds for each county, as well as licensed ICU beds.

The next question is what percentage of these beds are utilized. To get that, I consulted various sources, and the consensus is that around 60% to 65% of licensed beds are utilized during normal times. The utilization for ICU beds runs a bit higher -- around 68%.

That means that if CV19 patients take up 20% of available beds, we are near a crisis point. Why? For a couple of reasons. First, hospitals don’t hire staff for 100% utilization; they hire for the utilization rate that’s typical for them. So if there’s a surge of new patients, that means more overtime, longer shifts, no vacations, etc., and eventually hiring. Second, CV19 patients put an incredible amount of stress on a hospital -- PPE, isolation of patients, long stays, etc. Look at one of the YouTube videos from Bergamo and you’ll see what I mean.

From everything I’ve been able to read about it, a untilization rate of under 10% for regular CV19 patients and 15% for ICU patients is manageable. Anything above that results in stress on the system, and utilization rates at 25% and above are danger indicators.

Let me make one thing clear: I am not a hospital administrator, virologist, epidemiologist, scientist, etc. I am not an expert. I’m putting together data and giving you my interpretation of it. If any of you out there are experts, and see something I’ve got wrong, please correct me; I’m anxious to learn and get it right.

Back to the charts. There are five pieces of information.

1. Daily case counts based on  a 7 day moving average
2. Daily patient counts, based on 7 day avg.
3. Daily icu counts based on 7 day avg.
4. Daily hospital utilization rate, based on dividing daily patient counts into licensed beds for that county.
5. Daily ICU utilization rates, based on dividing daily icu counts into licensed icu beds for that county.

Each chart has two vertical axes. The left axis represents the daily counts; the right axis the rates.

What do these charts tell us?

* If case counts are increasing, they can help answer whether they are rising because of increased testing. If that’s the case, then you will probably see stable or falling hospitalization and icu rates. If those rates are rising, you know more people are getting sick, because getting a test doesn’t cause you to be hospitalized.
* They give us a good indication of how safe it is to open up and relax restrictions. Keeping in mind that the one of the main purposes of these restrictions in the first place was to preserve the hospital system, opening up the economy depends on utilization rates that are in the “safe zone.”

Commentary

I’m offering this commentary as a theory, in a way. It makes sense to me, but I hope that those of you out there with direct experience will set me straight.

**LA County \[CH1\]**

Cases show an upward trend, but hospitalizations as well as icu’s are going down. This may indicate that what the county has been saying, i.e. that the increased case count is a result of more testing, is true. Not only that, but hospital utilization rate (HUR) and icu utilization rates (IUR) are declining slightly. The HUR went from 8% 2 weeks ago to 7% today, and the IUR declined from a very high 22% to 18% today.

**San Diego County \[CH2\]**

The trend line for cases is slightly upward, but mostly flat. Hospitalizations and ICU’s have declined slightly. The HUR has been steady at 5%, and the IUR has declined from a high of 19% a couple of weeks ago to 17% today.

**Orange County \[CH3\]**

Mostly, this is the same situation as that in San Diego - almost flat case trend lines, slightly higher hospitalizations. The troubling thing here is the IUR, which has gone from 16% two weeks ago to 20% today.

**Riverside County \[CH4\]**

Here again we have sharply rising cases, but not mirrored in hospitalizations -- yet. Since the incubation period is up to 3 weeks, this may still happen. Indeed there is a slight increase in hospitalizations, but the increase is only about 20 per day over a two week period. The HUR and IUR remain relatively flat.

**Ventura County \[CH5\]**

Very much like Riverside, but here the increase in hospitalizations is slightly more pronounced, from 277 three weeks ago to 322 today. The HUR and IUR are flat.

**Kern County \[CH6\]**

This is the chart that could indicate some real trouble ahead. The absolute numbers are not huge, but the trend lines are moving upward more or less in unison. Over the past three weeks, cases have doubled, hospitalizations have doubled, and ICU’s have gone up by around 40%. The HUR is very high, at 25%. If their pre-pandemic HUR was 65%, and we add another 25% to that, it would give us an overall HUR of 90%. That doesn’t leave any wiggle room.

I’ve included the Vital Statistics tables just to keep you updated; discussion on that tomorrow.

Stay healthy and safe, everyone.

            I got so interested in Barbara that I made a wrong  
         turn on a detour and lost the state road.  So I stopped  
         outside a garage.    
            ""What's the best way for us to get to Fairfax Falls   
         from here?""  I asked the near-mechanic which come  
         out in answer to the horn.  
            This clown walks all around my home-made taxi,  
         looking at it like it was the first one he ever seen in  
         his born days.  
            ""You wish to go to Fairfax Falls in that boiler?"" he  
         inquires, like he can't believe his ears.  
            ""Absolutely,"" I says.  ""How will I get there?""  
            ""Well, if it was me, I'd pray for a miracle!"" he  
         answers, curling his lip.  With that he walks into the  
         garage and both them girls laugh their heads off.  
            But I found the road, and no further noteworthy  
         events happened till we're within a few miles of Fairfax  
         Falls.  Then it was different.  The old boat is rattling  
         off a noble twenty-five miles a hour when the sudden,  
         hair-raising wail of a siren makes the girls jump.  
         Through the rear-view mirror I peg a big, costly speed  
         wagon, cut along racing lines, roaring over the road  
         behind me.  I recognized the car and I likewise knew  
         that the proprietor of same had no right to use that  
         siren, as he was neither a police car, a fire engine or a  
         ambulance.  I started to tell the nervous girls that,  
         when this bozo, doing fifty miles a hour if he was mov-  
         ing at all, crowds me on a turn and we go crashing into  
         a ditch with Pansy yelling murder.  I still remember  
         there wasn't a single squawk coming from Barbara Bax-  
         ter——she was a thoroughbred, that's positive!  
            However, we landed right side up and there was   
         nobody hurt but my mudguards and temper.  While  
         I'm taking stock of the grief, our opponent drives  
         slowly back around the turn, stops beside us, and gets   
         out of his car.  He was no stranger to me, being no    
         less than Jack Fairfax, the sheik of Fairfax Falls and  
         the first villain I ever met with a name like a hero.  
            Roughly about the same age, me and Fairfax has  
         been first-class enemies of years standing, our private  
         war starting long before when I knocked his tomato  
         stiff for deliberately running his car over his dog.  
            That's the tip-off on the kind of guy he was——one  
         of these babies with a chin you love to touch!   
            Jack Fairfax was something of a mystery in our  
         town, where, in spite of the fact that it was named  
         after his family, he was a popular as typhoid fever.  
         His people had lived in Europe for years, and Fairfax  
         himself aced around mostly in Rochester and New  
         York City, tho nearly all Fairfax Falls was owned  
         by his parents.  He simply drove in every now and  
         then to burn the natives up by Ritzing 'em, while  
         showing some of his rich, sarcastical, cake-eating  
         friends the village named after him.  
            Amongst the Fairfax properties was a crumbling old  
         mansion on the outskirts of the town which some time   
         before had been spread all over the Sunday magazine  
         section of the newspapers as a haunted house.  It was   
         still looked on that way by most of Fairfax Falls, and  
         the citizens give it a wide berth in passing by.  You  
         couldn't get a kid within a mile of it!  Strange noises,  
         clanking chains, unearthly lights and weird groans was  
         just a few of the ""spirit signs"" which half the town  
         swore to and the other half laughed off.  Personally, I  
         was what you might call neutral, but through the fact  
         that Jack Fairfax constantly visited the place and  
         bragged about doing it, I figured the haunted-house  
         thing was apple sauce.  
            Well, when Fairfax come back that day after run-  
         ning me into the ditch I was naturally fit to be tied,  
         but on account of Barbara Baxter being there I didn't  
         smack him down.  Regarding the subject of girls going  
         wild over cave men——well, some do and some don't!  I  
         was taking no reckless chances.  Dressed like a fashion  
         plate, with a cigaret sticking out of his mouth from a  
         long, gold holder, this proper Humpty Dumpty stood  
         there sneering at me, and, of course, alongside of him  
         I looked like a tramp.  
            ""I'm going to complain to the authorities about that    
         remarkable conveyance of yours, Grimm,"" he says,  
         with a nasty grin.  It's a menace to navigation!""   
            Pansy laughed, but Barbara didn't.  I seen her coldly  
         sizing him up.  
            ""You should be heartily ashamed of yourself!""  
         bursts out Barbara warmly.  ""We might have been  
         killed!""  
            It was then Fairfax lamped her for the first time.  
         One amazed look at her floored him——you could see  
         that in he very readable face.  Off comes his swagger  
         cap.  It hadn't come off for Pansy.  
            ""Don't think because you're still on your feet that  
         I'll forget this , Fairfax!"" I says.  ""If we were alone,  
         I'd lay you like linoleum, you big false alarm!""  
            But he pays me not the faintest attention.  He's  
         all eyes for Barbara Baxter.  
            ""I——why——I——I gave you the horn and I tried to  
         avoid crowding you, but I——I was going too fast!"" he   
         stammers, talking directly to her.  ""I'm terribly sorry!  
         Won't you let me take you the rest of he way into  
         town?""  
            At that I dropped the jack I was getting ready to  
         raise the front wheels with and stared from him to  
         Barbara.  I noticed Pansy staring at me, and her face     
         was good and angry.  Fairfax had everything I didn't  
         have——clothes, class, money, a swell car, a great line  
         of chatter.  Regardless of the miles there was between  
         'em in every other way, Fairfax and Barbara belonged  
         in the same drawing-room, that was a cinch.  I was  
         just a taxi driver——where did I rate any favors from  
         her?  
            Barbara hesitated and looked thoughtfully at me,  
         while Fairfax's hungry eyes never left her face.  He  
         was hanging on her answer like it was a matter of life  
         or death.  I felt pretty low.  To me it was——a matter   
         of life or death to my hopes!  
            ""How long will it take you to make repairs?""  Bar-  
         bara asked me.  
            ""Five minutes!"" I says before the words was hardly   
         out of her pretty mouth.  
            ""You're crazy!"" snorts Fairfax, and he pulls open  
         the door of my taxi.  ""If you'll step out, Miss———""  
            ""I shall wait——you needn't bother!"" interrupts Bar-  
         bara, with icicles on every word, and my heart tries to  
         climb out through my ribs.  
            Get away from that cab, and make it snappy!"" I  
         bawls at Fairfax, taking a step toward him.  
            He moved slowly away and I could swear there was  
         a touch of contempt in Barbara's glance at him.  He  
         seen it too, but the ignored and enraged Pansy give  
         him a out——enabled him to take the air without choos-  
         ing me.  
            ""You can ride me into town, Mr. Fairfax,"" says  
         Pansy, and hopping out of my taxi she flounces into  
         the front seat of Fairfax's bus.  
            Fairfax hadn't invited her and this boy scout wasn't  
         particularly overjoyed at the idea of rolling into Fair-  
         fax Falls with the Commercial house waitress by his  
         side, beautiful or not.  However, he had no choice and  
         he shot away with a grinding of gears and probably a  
         grinding of teeth too.  The last I got was a poisonous  
         glare from Pansy.  
            ""I'm sorry I ain't got some magazines or something  
         in the car to amuse you,"" I said calmly to Barbara,  
         when they'd gone in a cloud of dust, ""because it's  
         going to take me a good hour and a lot of equally good   
         luck to get this mechanical toy where it'll roll!""  
            A flash of alarm in her lovely face is quickly chased  
         by anger.  
            ""What do you mean?"" she demands.  ""Why did you  
         tell me you could repair it in five minutes?""  
            ""I wouldn't fool you——it was because I wanted you  
         to stay!"" I says truthfully, opening up the hood and   
         gazing at the motor.  ""You're having a romantical  
         adventure——don't scream!""  

            Wam——what a furious stare I got for a minute!  
         Then I grinned cheerfully at her and darned if she  
         didn't grin back.  
            ""Why didn't you go into town with Fairfax——that  
         other fellow?"" I asked her, while I'm puttering around.  
            She opens a little beauty bag she;'s carrying and  
         powders the end of the most bewitching nose since  
         Helen from Troy.  
            ""I do not like his type,"" she says.  ""You seemed to  
         know him well——who is he?""  
            Well, that was just the beginning of four hundred  
         and eighty-six questions asked me by this toothsome  
         young lady while I'm trying to get Mr. Motor to mote.  
         She wanted to know all about Fairfax Falls, the natives,  
         the Fairfax family history, etc., etc., and even etc.  
         The haunted house particularly aroused her attention  
         and she made me promise to show her the place at my  
         earliest convenience.  Then she dreamily begins brush-  
         ing the sleeve of her dress with her lily-white hand.  
            ""And——Pansy?"" she asks me, without looking up.  
         ""Your sweetheart?""  
            ""By no means,"" I grins.  ""I ain't got no sweethearts  
         ——I'm just a boy which girls forget!""  
            That extracted a laugh from Barbara, a delightful  
         sound as she handled it.  
            ""You're a most unusual——er——taxi driver!"" she says.  
         ""Tell me something about yourself.""  
            ""Well, at last we'd struck a subject on which I was  
         well posted, and I certainly done it justice!  During  
         the course of the next half hour I broadcasted.  
            Barbara Baxter didn't pitch right into her job as  
         school-teacher, but Jack Fairfax stayed in town and   
         pitched right into trying to put over a fast one.  He   
         fairly swamped Barbara with flowers, candy, books,  
         auto-ride invitations or what have you?  Then, to my  
         great astonishment and rage, this scissorbill begin to  
         get results.  Twice she went out riding with him, which  
         got me red-headed and tickled Pansy silly.  
            After giving matters plenty of due consideration, I  
         decided to interview Barbara on the subject of Jack  
         Fairfax.  I seen her trip into Yackley's drug store one  
         morning and stopping my comedy taxi outside I   
         strolled in after her.  We sat down at the fountain and  
         I plied her with a chocolate soda.  
            ""Where you been keeping yourself?"" she asks  
         me, watching my face in the mirror behind the counter.  
         ""Long time no see!""  
            ""That don't seem to of ruined your health,"" I says  
         gloomily.  ""If I was you, I wouldn't five this Fairfax  
         too much leeway.  Fun's fun, but that bird's forever  
         looking for the best of it an———""  
            ""Just a moment!"" she cuts me off, colder by fifty-  
         four degrees than the ice cream in her glass.  ""I think  
         you forget that you and I are but chance acquaintances,  
         Bill.  You're not my father, my brother, my guardian  
         or my fiancé.  I'm quite able to take care of myself——  
         in any company.""  
            Surprized and hurt, I leaped up off the stool.  
            ""Good-by and excuse me!"" I says.  
            Darn it, I could feel my face flaming as red as all  
         the tomatoes in the world.  She had gave me the razz-  
         berry, cold turkey!  I started for the door, positive  
         that there ain't no Santy Claus, but she called me back  
         ——in a far different tone of voice.  
            ""Is your taxi engaged?"" she smiled——and I'm in love  
         all over again.  
            ""No,"" I says.  ""And I ain't engaged either.  I ain't  
         even going with nobody.""  
            ""Then take me out and show me that haunted house  
         you told me about,"" she commands.  ""And take that  
         sullen look off your face.  You know, you're really  
         handsome when you smile, Bill.""  
            ""When you smile, the rest of 'em is just girls,"" I  
         says and told the truth.  
            Well, I drove her out to Fairfax's alleged haunted  
         house and once we got there I had a hard time getting  
         her to leave.  Altho she'd asked me a rat of ques-  
         tions about this trap before, that didn't stop her from  
         asking me all about it again.  I never seen nobody so  
         curious!  Did anybody else besides Fairfax ever visit  
         the haunted house?  When and how often is the ghostly  
         noises heard?  Had the place ever been offered for  
         sale?  Did Fairfax himself tell people it was haunted?    
         That's just a few of the things Barbara wanted to  
         know and I gave her as many details as I had in stock.  
            Fairfax heard about this trip we took——probably  
         from Pansy Pilkington which saw us coming back——  
         and he gnashed his teeth.  The very next day he walks  
         up to my stand outside the hotel and says his car's in  
         the repair shop and he wants to engage my taxi for the  
         afternoon.  He acted so friendly I should of been sus-  
         picious, but instead I was thrown off my guard.  So  
         I met him at two o'clock as arranged, and he orders  
         me to drive him to the Commercial House.  Still I  
         don't tumble.  But when he comes outside with Bar-  
         bara Baxter on his arm I like to fell off my seat!  
            ""Just drive us around for a couple of hours,"" says   
         Fairfax, grinning from ear to ear.  ""I'll tell you when  
         to come back!""  
            Barbara looked amazed when she seen me——staring  
         first at Fairfax and then back at me.  I thought she  
         was in on this attempt to humiliate me and I give her  
         a frigid glare.  Up goes her head with a toss.  
            ""You don't mind driving us?"" she asks me.  
            ""Why should I?"" I shot at her.  ""This is my busi-  
         ness, ain't it?""  

            But within a hour I was three feet past infuriation   
         at the cracks Fairfax was making about me from the  
         back of the cab.  I suddenly whirled my taxi off the  
         road, shot through a gap in a fence and drove 'em  
         madly across a newly-plowed field, stepping on the gas  
         andn nearly bumping my passengers and my seagoing  
         taxi apart!  When later I come to a halt outside the  
         Commercial House, I'm satisfied I'd kind of dropped dead  
         if a look from Fairfax could of killed me.  
            ""How much do I owe you, you infernal idiot?"" he  
         pants, crazy mad.  
            ""Twenty-five bucks, you inveterate sap!"" I says, and  
         taking off my coat I begin to roll up my sleeves.  
            Barbara tried hard to keep a straight face and glare   
         at me, but she must of thought of something funny  
         because all at once she bust out laughing, winked at me  
         behind Fairfax's back and skipped into the hotel.  air-  
         fax gazed after her, glowered at me for a minute,  
         muttered a baffled oath and practically hurled the  
         twenty-five fish at me.  In a way, that was a disap-  
         pointment.  I was hoping he'd want to battle——if he  
         had, he'd of sure got service!  
            About a week after Barbara Baxter descended on  
         Fairfax Falls, a couple of more strangers got off 84, the  
         dilapidated spur-line train, and stepped into my cab.  
         Right off the bat I got a kick when they asked to be  
         hauled to the haunted house.  They're a pair of mys-  
         terious-looking eggs, and one of 'em must of spoke out  
         of turn somewheres, because he had a broken nose.  
         WhileI'm trying to figure 'em out, the other guy says  
         they're newspaper reporters from New York City and  
         they're going to write up something new and startling  
         about the haunted house, but they don't wish nobody  
         in Fairfax Falls to know of 'em being there.  The  
         fellow with the bum seller then shows me a twenty-  
         dollar note, tears it across and gives me half of it,  
         telling me I'll get the other half if I drive to the  
         haunted house as fast as my bus can go and by some  
         route which won't take 'em through the town.  I left  
         'em outside, looking at the house.  
            When I get back to my stand, I go to brush out the  
         cab and I find one of them jazzbos has forgot to take  
         a portfolio with him.  So once again I drive to the    
         haunted house, but there's no sign of nobody around,  
         and tho I thump and thump on the front door I can't  
         get no answer.  Going around to the rear of this old  
         ruin, I get a attack of dumfoundment.  Cuddled up  
         against a window is no less than Barbara Baxter, plainly  
         getting an earful of what's going on inside the house!  
            ""Well, for weeping in public!"" I gasps, ""what are  
         you doing here?""  
            You should have saw her jump.  
            ""I——why——I——well——er——spiritualism is a hobby of  
         mine, Bill,"" she says, recovering her wits and coming  
         over to me.  ""I've been studying the haunted house——   
         listening for the——er——ghosts and that sort of thing,  
         you know!""  
            She winds up with a little laugh which sounded to  
         me like it was forced.  I must say she seemed anything  
         but at ease.  
            ""Well, there ain't no ghosts in there now!"" I says.  
         ""There's a couple of guys———""  
            ""Yes——who are they?"" she butts in excitedly.  
            ""I promised I wouldn't tell,"" I said, after a minute.  
         I was thinking of something else.  ""Say, listen——when  
         are you going to begin teaching school here?"" I ask her.  
            That innocent question didn't seem to add nothing  
         to her peace of mind.  She give me a long, odd look.  
            ""Very soon, now,"" she says.  ""I'll wait in your taxi  
         and you can drive me back to town.  I——I walked out   
         here, you know.  And——Bill, don't say a word to those  
         men in there, or to any one, about my being here!""  
            While Barbara sat in the cab around in front I  
         pounded on the back door of the house till the fellow  
         with the caved-in beak answered, asking who I was  
         through the door before he opened it.  I gave him the   
         portfolio and he's highly delighted, calling to his pal to  
         see what they nearly lost.  The little act of honesty  
         on my part wins me ten bucks more and a order to   
         call for 'em at eight the following night.  It wasn't till  
         I'd left Barbara at the hotel that the thought struck  
         me.  ""How did them two guys get in that house when  
         it's always locked?""  
            Driving to the haunted house a little before 8 P. M.  
         the following day, as per my engagement, who should  
         call to me from the sidewalk but Barbara Baxter.  No  
         sooner does she find out where I'm bound for than she  
         insists on going with me.  Well, I was in a fine predica-  
         ment.  She wanted to go, she was sure she'd see the   
         ""ghosts"" at night, and if you ever witnessed this girl  
         you'd get a idea of how hard it was to refuse her  
         anything!  So I took her with me on the front seat,  
         just to see what would happen.  I seen what would  
         happen, I'll howl to the wide, wide world!  
            I parked a little distance from the haunted house  
         at Barbara's request and left her there while I walked  
         up, knocked, and was let inside.  The first thing I  
         noticed is that the hall is full of wooden boxes,piled  
         high on top of each other.  One of the reporters says  
         to back my taxi around to the rear, as they wish to  
         load the boxes in it.  I asks him where they are going,  
         and he says to Rochester.  
            ""Nothing stirring!"" I says firmly.  ""I wouldn't wheel  
         that old bus of mine to Rochester at night on a bet.  
         Besides, it would fall apart with all them boxes in it.  
         What's in 'em?""  
            ""Never mind what's in 'em!"" says the guy with the  
         broken nose shortly, ""but there's seventy-five bucks in   
         this for you if you tend to your knittin'!""  
            But I had a sudden, queer feeling that something  
         was wrong.  I thought of barbara sitting outside alone  
         in my taxi, and I commenced to back out the hall,  
         when a door's flung open and Jack Fairfax stumbles  
         headlong into the house!  He ain't got no hat on, and  
         his face is as white as a sheet.  Personally I'm com-  
         mencing to get a bit dizzy.  
            ""What the——"" begins one of the reporters.  
            ""The state troopers are on their way here——we're  
         sunk!"" bawls Fairfax and then he catches sight of me.  
         What did you let that fellow in here for?"" he howls.  
         ""He's the one who tipped them off!""  
            Fairfax stood in the background, panting and swear-  
         ing at me, but the two reporters rushed me together.  
         We are wrestling all over the place when the doors  
         crash in and the house is swarming with state troopers.  
         I never seen so many guns before in all my life, and  
         the next thing we're all pinched, including your boy  
         friend Bill Grimm.   
         
            One of the troopers caved in the lid of a box in the  
         hall, and it turns out to be full of bottles.  The bottles  
         is full of booze.  Good night!  Things had indeed come  
         to pass, and I seen the hoosegow staring me  
         right in the face, when Barbara Baxter saunters in the  
         now open door.  Fairfax, held by a couple of husky  
         troopers the same as I was, give a gasp and looked  
         thoughtful when he seen her, but I was too dazed to  
         gasp——the whole thing smacked of nightmare to me!  
            The troopers seemed to know Barbara and give her  
         respectful attention, while she gives me a pleasant and  
         unanswered smile.  Then she tells 'em to take their  
         hands off me, as I'm as innocent as a very young baby.  
         Not only that, she goes on, but I've helped her get the  
         evidence that Jack Fairfax and the other two scofflaws  
         is the master minds of a state-wide gang of common,   
         ordinary bootleggers.  They was no more newspaper  
         reporters than I'm a Siamese duke!  
            While the troopers is loading their cursing prey and  
         the boxes of hooch into the cars outside, Barbara leads  
         the way into the deserted front room of the house and  
         tells me things.  There was spirits in that haunted  
         house all right, but they was ""spiritus frumenti""!  It  
         seems State Prohibition Enforcement Headquarters had  
         been tipped that whisky was being brought to Fairfax  
         Falls from Canada, taken to the alleged haunted house,  
         and ""cut"" before being sold throughout the state.  Bar-  
         bara Baxter, a special revenue agent, was sent to our  
         town as a school-teacher to get Fairfax and his pals  
         with the goods.  
            ""Hasn't it been thrilling, Bill?"" she asks me, with  
         her hand on my arm.  But I'm half sore——half disap-   
         pointed.  
            ""You've made me look like a squealer!"" I says, ""I  
         ain't infatuated with Jack Fairfax by no means, but  
         that ain't the way I'd of boxed him.  I fight in the   
         open, myself!""  
            ""But you've done a splendid thing!"" says Barbara,  
         tho she did blush.  ""They were vicious lawbreakers,  
         Bill, and———""  
            ""Why did you give me a run-around about being a  
         school-teacher?"" I shut her off.  ""I told you the truth  
         about myself!""  
            ""Bill——I——had to feel my way carefully,"" she says.  
         ""I had to know I could trust you!""  
            ""Well, do you trust me now?"" I asked her.  
            ""Indeed I do!"" she whispers.  Again her hand  
         touches my arm, and them Alice blue eyes look deep   
         into mine.  Standing as close to her as that in the  
         pitch-dark room, I got more kick than there was in all   
         of Fairfax's booze.  I had to put on the brakes——hard!""  
            ""Being a copper is no job for a girl!"" I busts out.  
         I had to say something!""  
            ""Oh, isn't it?"" says Barbara.  ""Well, I made good,  
         didn't I?  Bill——bootleg whisky ruined my home!  It  
         killed my father and cost my brother a high executive   
         position.  I wish I could put every one of those mur-  
         derers in jail for life!  I——why are you so——so quiet?""  
            ""I'm thinking that the only reason you were so nice  
         to me at all was to get the dope on them guys!"" I   
         told her.
            ""Then you're thinking wrong!"" she says softly.  ""I——  
         I like you, Bill!""  
            That's where we should of went into a clinch, but she  
         was alone in that dark room with me, and she trusted  
         me.  I didn't know how she'd take it, and I refused to  
         gamble!  I figured it would keep, so I just said  
         ""Thanks!"" and shook her hand.  
            ""Bill,"" says Barbara, ""are you going to be a taxi  
         chauffeur all your life?""  
            ""What's the difference?"" I says.  ""It's honest trade,  
         and there's good money in it!  I———""  
            ""Nonsense!"" she butts in.  ""Why don't you get out  
         of Fairfax Falls, get rid of that absurd automobile, and  
         start doing something big?  Get into something worth   
         while and lay the foundation for your future before it's  
         too late.  Why, there must be dozens of things you can  
         do that offer more possibilities than driving a taxicab in   
         a small town.""  
            I said nothing at all——I was busy thinking.  Then I  
         realized I still had hold of her hand, and I let it go.  
         We went out to my taxi, and I drove her back to town,  
         the trip being made mostly in silence, tho she sit  
         beside me on the front seat.  When we got to the  
         Commercial House she says she was going to New York  
         City to stay with he aunt for a while, and when I  
         merely give her a gloomy ""Good-by!"" she seemed  
         peeved, for some reason.  Then she give me her aunt's  
         address and phone number, again telling me to leave  
         Fairfax Falls, which was cramping my style, for bigger  
         fields and bigger opportunities.  I took it for granted  
         she was walking right out of my life when she walked  
         up the stairs of that hotel.  I'll never take nothing  
         for granted again!  
            Well, I followed Barbara Baxter's advice, and I did  
         get out of Fairfax Falls for a bigger playgrounds.  I  
         went to New York City, and I drove a taxi there!  
            Now you tell one.

"(Obligatory ""sorry for mobile"") hey folks so basically I'm a part time cashier at what is considered an essential business but I am actually terrified to go into work. Now I'm 20 years old so I'm not too concerned about myself but I'm living with my elderly parents (mom is 60 dad is 50 and smokes a drinks regularly) and I am very worried that I'm going to catch this virus and give it to them. Also, I deal with the public (mainly elderly customers) and ive been handling A LOT of money recently and touching products they buy to scan them etc. and I am concerned if I have the virus I can give it to an elderly customer. Probably just spooking myself but I have a sore throat, a little congestion/runny nose, and I'm coughing a little through the day. On one side I feel as though I should go to work to help my co-workers because it's been CRAZY busy all week but on the other I'm scared shitless about what will happen if I catch it. I have about two shifts in total worth of paid sick time lol. Am I just freaking out and over worrying or is this justified?"|Connecticut|2020|True|0

From an ER doctor in NYC. The situation will be similar in CT soon enough. 

1) The ED (emergency department) is now separated into two areas: one for traditional emergencies and what has been dubbed, “The COVID pit.”

2) A vast majority of folks in the COVID pit aren’t sick enough for any intervention and because of that fact, they cannot test them for COVID unless they are being admitted for breathing difficulties.

3) Those “worried-well” folk jamming up the ED all have to get seen by law. So they (doctors/nurses) have to change into new clean protective-wear to talk to them. They (doctors) wind up giving them Tylenol (which costs the patient like $300) and sending them home. Now, they’ve just wasted a set of clean protective-wear. The reason we’re in such a dire shortage of protective equipment for hospital staff is because these worried people come and need to be seen. STAY HOME UNLESS YOU HAVE SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

"Same thing; he guided me also. Never thought Id get the attention these guys gave me as I thought I't be put in some long waiting line but got some nice personal responses.

Cut and paste from MS Outlook disabled some of the links though.

Some important info here especially about unemployment.

Dear Mr. xxx,

While we all work together to help our communities through this public health emergency, I want my office to be a resource for you and your family to find the latest information and guidance on any questions you might have. Below, I’ve compiled a quick update on some of the latest news regarding the COVID-19 outbreak, and important information about resources that are becoming available to help families, workers, and businesses through this period of economic contraction.

As Congress continually works to respond to the needs of the American people, and as this crisis evolves, I will regularly update you with additional legislative action and resources. This is not an all-encompassing list of the response efforts in the works, and much more information will be available as we continue our work.

First and foremost, to find the latest information from the **Center for Disease Control** and the **Connecticut Department of Public Health**, please visit their websites, linked here:

My office has also pulled together helpful links, resources, and information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak on my website, which can be found here

**Resources for Small Businesses**

You may be interested to know that the **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is now offering low-interest federal disaster loans for working capital to Connecticut small businesses and non-profits** suffering substantial economic injury as a result of COVID-19. Any Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance declaration issued by the SBA makes loans available to small businesses and private, non-profit organizations in designated regions, including Connecticut, to help alleviate economic injury caused by COVID-19.

These loans offer up to $2 million in assistance and can be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other bills at an interest rate of 3.75% for small businesses and 2.75% for non-profits. Loan repayment terms are capped at 30 years, and are defined on a case-by-case basis based on a borrower’s ability to repay.

How to apply:

* Applicants may apply online, receive additional disaster assistance information and download applications at [https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=CT02JC&crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&report_id=&redirect=https%3a%2f%2fdisasterloan.sba.gov%2fela&redir_log=781004530023224).

**Resources for Veterans**

Serving our nation’s veterans has always been one of my top priorities in Congress, and it always will be. If you are a veteran with any health concerns surrounding COVID-19, give your local Veterans Administration (VA) facility a call immediately – if you don’t know where it is, just call my office and we’ll help you locate it.

The VA is implementing a strong public health response to help our communities curb the spread of COVID-19, and to care for our vets in the face of this health emergency. They’ve administered over 300 COVID-19 tests so far, and they’re continuing to take aggressive steps to prevent transmission. [If you are a veteran, general information from the VA on the latest significant events and updates related to COVID-19 can be found](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=CT02JC&crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&report_id=&redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.publichealth.va.gov%2fn-coronavirus%2f%3futm_source%3dHomepage%26utm_campaign%3dCoronavirus&redir_log=143633212133677) here.

**Information on Unemployment Insurance for Workers**

Last week, the House passed another bipartisan legislative package aimed at providing aid to the thousands of Americans impacted by the economic contraction brought on by COVID-19. Included in this latest package were some critical provisions for American families and workers facing lost hours and income, like greatly enhanced unemployment insurance.

Yesterday, the Senate passed our bill on to the President’s desk, and last night it was signed into law. My office will be releasing information and updates regarding this package as they come. In the meantime, there are some existing programs now that people can begin to take advantage of.

If you are unemployed due to the COVID-19 public health emergency and are seeking benefits, or if you’re an employer seeking additional information, please visit [http://www.filectui.com/](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=CT02JC&crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&report_id=&redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.filectui.com%2f&redir_log=635020194325167).

Additional guidance:

* Do not delay filing your claim for unemployment benefits even if your employer has not issued you any paperwork. It is important to file as soon as you become unemployed to avoid being denied benefits.
* For faster processing of your claim, please have your employer’s registration number and a return to work date readily available when you file your claim online.
* If you have additional questions regarding your claim, you should first visit the Connecticut Department of Labor’s Online Assistance Center at [www.filectui.com](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=CT02JC&crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&report_id=&redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.filectui.com&redir_log=236110509735164). Live chat is available for questions concerning unemployment compensation, including the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on the program.
* You may also submit your general question to [dol.webhelp@ct.gov](mailto:dol.webhelp@ct.gov). A response can be expected in 3 to 5 business days, depending on volume.

**Paid Sick and Family Leave**

As part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Congress passed emergency paid sick leave and emergency paid family leave to ensure that working people who need to take time off from work either because they are sick or because their children are home from school can continue to receive paychecks and pay their bills. Employers will be reimbursed from the federal government for the costs of paying their workers at this time.

For more information about these provisions and how they might impact you as an employer or employee, [please see my press release about the bill here](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=CT02JC&crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&report_id=&redirect=https%3a%2f%2fcourtney.house.gov%2fmedia-center%2fpress-releases%2fcourtney-statement-senate-approval-house-passed-covid-19-&redir_log=170595964668781).

"I'm actually in tears. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I've been trying to get groceries for most of the month. I knew something was up when many of staples disappeared in early March. 

I don't have a car, I am low income and now unemployed. I rented a car and drove around New Haven county and got some food (but not a ton, because a lot of stores were out) in early March.

It has literally not gotten better since the start of the month. A week and a half ago, I tried everything -- I use a lot of pickup services because I rent a car hourly and get severe migraines from in-store lighting. Most of my food was substituted out and unavailable. 

I also have food allergies. It seems that when the hoarders are running out of normal food, they are raiding my allergy-safe food -- its much more expensive, why are you this desperate?

I am down to my last bottle of hand soap and last few rolls of TP. I have a few oz of disinfectant left. Oh, and my produce delivery box got cancelled due to local demand being too high to fill. 

I am now quarantined until I can get tested (there is a waiting list in CT)  because I fit the profile to a T. No groceries. Very little soap. No disinfectant. And if I come back positive, I won't be allowed any for weeks. I live alone, all my family is out of state. And I am so, so, so sick."|Connecticut|2020|True|0
"How many people do you personally know that have the virus?
 
How many of you know someone who knows someone who has the virus?
 
If the incubation period is so long, and testing is just getting ramped up and 80% of those infected are barely impacted, isn’t this thing everywhere already?
 
But how many of you know someone who’s been laid off, furloughed or had their hours reduced? And what about for you. What’s more likely at this point? You get sick from the virus or you get laid off? Given your risk factors, which scenario would be worse for you and those that depend on you?
 
With malls closed, restaurants partially closed, many business doing work from home, and everyone being encouraged to self quarantine, an economic hell is about to be unleashed. Even businesses that are staying open are slowing down dramatically.
 
How many thousands of people in your state have been laid off for EACH singular case of the coronavirus?
 
Based on unemployment claims in the first 4 days this week, Connecticut is looking at 40,000 in just one week. That’s 400 people out of work for EVERY SINGLE positive test so far. That’s 1700 people who have lost their job for EVERY SINGLE hospitalization thus far. And that’s before the mall closures that go into effect tonight.
 
Is that smart?

3,250 people have died from this virus in the last four months in China, a country of 1.3 billion people. 25,000 people have been laid off because of the virus (?) so far this week in Connecticut, a state of 3.5 million people. Does this make sense? Is this our best possible option?
 
This is already crushing the poor. It’ll crush the middle class soon too. This is not sustainable. And yet, all we hear is about closures and shut downs deepening, not letting up any time soon.
 
Why aren’t we talking about how in Connecticut this winter, 2300+ have been hospitalized for the flu, and only 23 hospitalized for the virus thus far? Obviously those numbers will change, but where were Ned Lamont’s daily press conferences and daily executive orders for a flu outbreak that - to date - is 100 times more severe than what we’re experiencing right now? Where was the pressing need to shut everything down and shelter in place? Why wasn’t it okay then to sacrifice people’s livelihoods for the common good? It may spread faster and be more lethal, but we don’t know that for certain yet and we certainly don’t know to what degree.
 
I’m glad that we’re paying attention. This virus deserves our attention and we ought to make sacrifices. But our attention seems to be staggeringly one dimensional.
 
Why aren’t we talking about Italy in perspective? What’s happening there is horrific. It’s tragic. Parts of it were avoidable to be sure. Italy is a country of 60 million people. If Italy’s number of dead triple, and their rate of infection and death ends up coming to pass here, adjusting for our population, 54,000 Americans will die - which matches the upper limit of the CDC’s estimate for the number of flu deaths in the US this year (55,000). Why no outrage then? Why no social distancing? Because we were used to it? Or because we had no idea it was going on?
 
Are Italy and the US the same? Italy is older. They smoke more. I’m sure their population density in some of their areas of outbreak is far higher than the majority of America too. For every reason we worry that we’ll become Italy, we have reasons to believe we won’t.
 
The Italian government released a study yesterday of 1,000+ of the Coronavirus deaths. 99% of those that died had preexisting conditions. The overwhelming majority were seniors. Did they deserve to die? Of course not. Should we just let them? Of course not. But this is what happens every year and in every country. This strain is novel. But the flu kills. The common cold kills. Slips and falls kill. Cars kill. But they never get the focus of the global community in the same way, and we’ve come to coexist with their risks. How can we mitigate the risk of this virus without annihilating everything else in the process?
 
And what’s less normal? A respiratory virus killing thousands like we see every year but pay little attention to, or a global shutdown?
 
Yes, this virus is worse. Yes people will die. Yes death is tragic. Yes I’m sure this will be personal for me too. Maybe I’ll get it. Maybe I’ll die. Who knows. Death is always a guarantee. But where is our healthy sense of skepticism and concern for the collateral damage wrought by all of our countermeasures?
 
If you look at incidences that have begun to get under control: China, South Korea, Diamond Princess - it’s entirely possible that this thing winds up being far less bad than many of the estimates contributing to the hysteria. Of course we know so little that it’s likely that it becomes far worse too. We don’t know.
 
People are scared. And I think it’s responsible to shut things down or at least scale back considerably for a few weeks to try to slow the spread and give our healthcare system the opportunity to prepare. And to be clear: I don’t think this is remotely political. This isn’t a conspiracy. So we can absorb a few weeks of shutdown, and we should. I’m not suggesting we be reckless or cavalier. We have to value life.
 
But months? Do we have any idea what that means?
 
The death and devastation wrought by the economic depression that this will trigger will far outpace anything this virus can throw at us, won’t it? How can it not? There’s only so many trillions the Fed can print and spend. And yet nearly all of us are sitting back and virtue signaling about our willingness to do what we’re told without asking the critical questions that need asking. Why?
 
People that I know and love, and people that you know and love are about to have their lives torn apart - and in almost every case, it won’t be because someone is sick."|Connecticut|2020|True|0

I don't know if they have fevers, but I don't think they do either. My bosses have not done anything aside from provide wipes at the front desk. 

They are not even urging employees to stay home if sick. They are ignoring the caronavirus national emergency entirely.  

We are a collection company and the phones have been dead. I have to assume we're losing money anyway....so why not offer supplemental paid sick time in light of this crisis.

"I've been worrying about COVID-19 for weeks now, and have had supplies prepared for about a month.  However, lots of people in my life only started taking this seriously yesterday.  My mother-in-law, for example, just now realized how little food and dog food she has, and is worried about making sure she has enough in case of a quarantine.

If she were to go out today, among all the other panic buyers, there's a good chance there would be an infected person among them, who could pass it on to her.  She's in her 60s, and there's a good chance she might not survive if she gets sick.  That goes double for her mother whom she lives with, who is in her 80s.

However, my wife and I are in our early 30s, and although it would suck to get sick, the odds that we would die are very low.  So, we plan on doing the grocery shopping for them, disinfecting everything, and dropping it off at their door.

While it would be nice if everyone was better prepared for this, this is just the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in.  If you are young and have older people you care about, I suggest you do the same, and try to find other ways to mitigate their risk as well.

"(this is taken from other subs mostly) 

Coronavirus bio: 

- 5% of people require [artificial respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_ventilation), an additional 15% need [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy). Overall, about 80% of cases are mild, and 20% severe. Overall, there has been a case fatality rate of around ~3.6%. For comparison, the flu is about ~0.096%. The r-0 of this virus has been said to be around 3.5 to 6. The r-0 of influenza is about 1.3. Please stop spreading the ""its just a flu"" misinformation. 

- Infection lasts 2 to 4 weeks for mild cases, 3 to 6 weeks in severe cases. Reinfection is possible and has been confirmed in multiple cases. 

- People can spread the disease before they show any symptoms, ie you can infect other people before you know you are sick. 

- Infection is primarily spread through aerosolized respiratory droplets. Fecal transmission is highly likely as well and possibly more infectious. 

- In China, we saw the local healthcare system in Hubei completely overwhelmed. This is a bad thing, as the healthcare systems being overwhelmed might possibly mean a higher death rate (20% of patients need intensive treatment afterall). In China, mass quarantines and lockdowns have been used to contain the disease. Currently, the CCP is reporting falling infection numbers in their country, although these numbers are suspect for obvious reasons. 

- The virus can be spread by a person before they exhibit any symptons, ie a person can spread it before they know they are sick. 

- The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

- Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (untreated diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

- [Fatality rate by age](https://files.catbox.moe/l5q4fy.png)

- Sex: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

- There is [some unsubstantiated speculation that the disease may cause infertility in men](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418v1.full.pdf). There has also been unsubstantiated speculation that the disease may be deadlier in people of asian descent due to the aforementioned ACE2 receptor. 

- As you probably already know, there have already been confirmed communal transmissions of coronavirus on the west coast (not able to be traced to China) 

**What you can do to prepare**: The less you have to go out, the less your chances of contracting this disease. If you are a healthy young person, you may feel safe, but please remember you probably also have contact with some elderly people, like your parents or grandparents. Even if you don't, you getting infected. So my advice to you is: 

- **MAKE SURE your elderly relatives are taken care of and know what to do and what to avoid doing.** This is by far the most important thing imo. They are the most at risk rn. 

- Avoid restaurant eating and going out for nonessential reasons. 

- Stockpile some non perishable food, just in case we get quarantines/lockdowns as has happened in Italy and China. I've gotten a bunch of canned food and some butter and things to freeze. 

- Make sure you have first aid and medicine supplies. If you get sick with something other than coronavirus during this pandemic, the absolute last place you will want to go is to the healthcare system, since it will be completely overwhelmed and you will most likely contract the virus there. 

- Just to be safe, I have gotten p100's, but the CDC says m95's will be effective. Surgical masks do probably have reduced effectiveness, but I'd always take them over nothing. Airtight goggles might also help. Also remember to get things like toothpaste, **soap,** toilet paper, ammunition, and other such things. Standard disaster preparedness."|Connecticut|2020|True|0

My brother recently finished paying off his vehicle loan last year and received the Maryland Notice of Security Interest Filing (SIF) during this time he, unfortunately, became extremely ill and was diagnosed with stage 3 liver disease and has been in 2 coma's from organ failing. He was never able to take the paperwork to the MVA to obtain the actual title and now he's too sick to stand in line at an MVA to do so what would be the best way to go about doing this he's also offered to sell me the vehicle because he needs the money as he hasn't been able to work for almost a year now and the recent disability SS checks that he has started getting are barely enough for him and the kids so I've been thinking about just buying the car but we would have to figure this out first.|Maryland|2024|True|0
"I've seen a lot of negativity today regarding [Toby Keith](https://www.facebook.com/tobykeith?__cft__[0]=AZVW0UbTZD9YcbtSJiWSgSMl9Nc7ZH01yUQ8FZUAxRjTaZUX_Hr6FXKtKLoGfN_ZLXJ46tb9UkGxW1Cj9w5JsfgGLfiN62T0nzlqgeZPdpVSyR-HWvTUIDJPwqy4Nncd8XZ6UlFv7GYhc59QXZM06pec8yoRRgxpCstkinH0uGoAlpJl-MAJ0IsCJUO-TDgN-dUhjw1IEch7GG4YPcGHuYWt&__tn__=-]K-y-R), especially as it pertains to the heavy patriotism and feud with [The Chicks](https://www.facebook.com/thechicks?__cft__[0]=AZVW0UbTZD9YcbtSJiWSgSMl9Nc7ZH01yUQ8FZUAxRjTaZUX_Hr6FXKtKLoGfN_ZLXJ46tb9UkGxW1Cj9w5JsfgGLfiN62T0nzlqgeZPdpVSyR-HWvTUIDJPwqy4Nncd8XZ6UlFv7GYhc59QXZM06pec8yoRRgxpCstkinH0uGoAlpJl-MAJ0IsCJUO-TDgN-dUhjw1IEch7GG4YPcGHuYWt&__tn__=-]K-y-R).

I think it's important to remember that not everybody is perfect. Toby Keith had recently lost his veteran father and 9/11 had just happened, and he (along with most of the US) fell into that heavy patriotism. I used to love Courtesy of the Red White and Blue, and I think American Soldier still stands as a good representation of what military life is like as a dad. Toby Keith also did more than 200 USO shows which are really good for morale while we're downrange. 

Toby Keith was also a registered Democrat until 2007 when he registered as an Independent. He vocally supported Clinton and Obama, and openly criticized Trump. He admitted that he only played at the inauguration because they paid him a ton of money. I'm not saying I'd have done the same thing, but I can understand it. He's on record saying he was embarrassed for his role in the feud with the Dixie Chicks and apologized. 

Respectfully, I think sometimes we draw these hard lines in the sand and view people as entirely bad or entirely good instead of the complicated human beings that we are. Don't get me wrong, sometimes these lines are 100% justified and there are some truly bad people out there (cough cough Trump).

I grew up loving Toby Keith's music and while I didn't always agree with him, I appreciated everything he did for Ally's House, a non-profit for children with cancer and I appreciate all the time he spent with us when we were deployed. He also supported a non-profit that worked to support music education in poor schools who otherwise can't afford it.

I'm far from a perfect person, I've made mistakes that I'm not proud of. I hope when I'm gone that people will consider the whole person concept, and not just my mistakes. Toby Keith was a legend that yes, made mistakes, but was a kind, honest, and loving person that genuinely and deeply cared for his community."|Oklahoma|2024|True|0
My wife had reservations to fly Alaska Airlines from Oklahoma City to Fairbanks on Sunday March 1, 2020.  There had been considerable news about the Corona Virus hotspot in Seattle, so my wife was very concerned about spending any time in Seattle.   Alaska Airlines had a mechanical issue that delayed the flight in Oklahoma City to Seattle be at least 2 hours.  My wife repeatedly told the gate agents for Alaska Airlines that she did not want to fly to Seattle is they could not make sure she got her connection to Fairbanks, because she could spend the night with her mother in OKC.  Alaska Airlines personnel assured my wife that she would be able to make her flight to Fairbanks prior to boarding in OKC.  Of course, at 12:30 PM on Monday morning at Sea-Tac airport, my wife was told that she had to spend the night in a hotel in Seattle.  The hotel room was smelly and dirty.  My wife did not make it to Fairbanks until nearly 10 PM Monday March 2, 2020.  On Thursday last  week, my wife and I came down with flu like symptoms that rapidly progressed to difficulty breathing.  I was diagnoised this week at a medical clinic with pneumonia.  I cannot get a Covid-19 test due in Alaska because of the crazy guidelines adopted by the State of Alaska, but my wife and my symptoms are exactly the same as Tom Hanks described on the Television on Thursday morning.  Despite making a written complaint with Alaska Airlines and calling and leave the customer service Vice President a voicemail, we have heard nothing from Alaska Airlines about this incident.   I wanted everyone out there to know that Alaska Airlines actions have vividly demonstrated to my wife and I that Alaska Airlines has absolutely  no concern for your health and should be strenuously avoided as an air carrier option in these trying times, unless you want to spend the night in Seattle and be needlessly exposed to Corona Virus.|Alaska|2020|True|1
" 

So I have had a running nose, nasty cough and fever for  about a week and missed several days from work this week.  My wife's  flight back from Oklahoma City  a week ago Sunday went through Seattle  and arrived late and she was forced to spend the night in Seattle and  got home late the next day.  I started getting sick on Thursday night.  I  went to the Tanana Valley Clinic First Care clinic today because they  told me that they would give me a corona virus test over the phone based  on my symptoms.  When I arrived at the clinic,  I put on a face mask,  but I was surprised because they took no extra precautions that I might  have Corona Virus.

My  fever has been coming and going was my body temp was near normal today  at the clinic.  My flu test was negative.  A chest xray confirmed that I  have pneumonia, but the doctor said that I could not get a Corona Virus  test, because my pneumonia was not severe enough to admit me to the  hospital.   They prescribed me with a course of antibiotics and told me  to come back in two days if I get worse.  If being so sick you have to  get admitted to the Hospital is the criteria to perform a test in the  State of Alaska, its no wonder there are no positive tests in Alaska  yet.  The doctor said that he would have to fight with the State of  Alaska Virologist to get me a Corona Virus test if I was not being  admitted to the hospital.

"Born and raised here in Central Florida, pollen season has WHOOPED MY ASS from birth!

Every spring growing up my parents would pick me up from school due to flu symptoms - just to take me to the pediatrician and be told it's a pollen allergy.

The season is approximately Valentine's day to Mother's day, and I've gotten a pretty good routine down to manage my symptoms. I had a laser therapy, which was pretty pseudosciency, but my allergies haven't been as bad since 🤷🏼‍♀️

How I'm currently handling my allergies -

Claritin daily, Flonase once a week (if I use it a lot it inhibits my smelling), benadryl on rough nights, lots of laundry and showers, zatidor for eyes...

It's still killing me! The wind isn't helping. But it's getting to the point where it hinders my life. I'm either awake and sick, or feeling healthy but sleepy thanks to benadryl. I'm miserable at night bc I can't breathe through my nose.

"So I was late on my FPL twice. Between Ian and a bout of Covid plus managing care for two very sick parents, I’m overloaded. With mail seemingly delayed, I just missed payments by a couple of days. I paid late fees but now FPL wants to charge me over $500 as a deposit to continue service. They say they will shut off service if we don’t pay. I think this is absolutely reprehensible and I’m furious, particularly because they had no problem charging us for service they didn’t provide through Ian.

As I understand it, it’s illegal to go “off grid”. Can anyone explain how that can be enforced if FPL can terminate service and they are no alternate providers? Frankly, I’m tempted to let them shut me off and convert to solar. I have a whole house generator and while it would be expensive to use, I’m feeling just spicy enough to pay for it while getting solar squared away rather than be extorted by FPL.

"Hey Seattle, 

My wife and I are planning to move to Seattle soon and are looking for recommendations on the best neighborhoods to live in. Our budget for a two-bedroom apartment is around $3-4k per month. We have a vehicle but would prefer to rely on public transit to avoid traffic headaches, especially during rush hours.

One crucial aspect for us is proximity(or simply an easy commute option) to Wallingford as we both work there. We're hoping for a relatively easy commute, so any public transport feedback would be amazing. I will be close to the north transfer station in Wallingford. 

 Additionally, we love vibrant neighborhoods with a good mix of restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores like Trader Joe’s nearby. We're especially fond of Thai food, sushi, Chinese, Vietnamese etc and BBQ, so any neighborhood with great options for these cuisines would be a huge plus.

In addition to these preferences, what other factors should we consider when moving to Seattle? We've thought about things like safety, access to parks or recreational areas, school districts (if applicable), and overall community vibe. Are there any hidden gems or lesser-known neighborhoods that might fit our criteria? We also love to hike!

One example could be a neighborhood further out and a bad vehicle commute, but with the light rail it’s only 2 stops for a total of 20 min… this would fit right into what I am looking for! 

We appreciate any insights, recommendations, or personal experiences you can share to help us make an informed decision about where to live in this beautiful city. Thank you in advance for your help!

"Anyone else just fully exhausted by this? Like, I love the Skylark, Ounces, Alki Academy, etc., but these businesses do not own their buildings/properties, there is no guarantee that moving the light rail to avoid them doesn’t mean the landlord won’t elect to redevelop in the future anyways. Most of this area as-is would also create a headache for pedestrian/vehicle conflicts around the station as well; I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen a car turn out of the Uptown/Subway lot and almost hit another car/person/pedestrian near the intersection. Redeveloping the preferred acquisition properties would fix a lot of the existing travel mode conflicts in that area.

Simply put, I’d prefer to see more assistance put into relocating these businesses, but not delay light rail/increase costs/create a subpar station experience by trying to avoid some aging one-story buildings.

"Hi All, I live in Ballard and have the misfortune of being neighbors with a doggy daycare.   The dog daycare is open from Monday- Friday 7 AM - 7 PM and Saturday - Sunday 10 AM- 6 PM and have dogs outside barking pretty much the entire time (weekends are much better).

I have tried to work with the company in order to resolve the barking, but that has gotten me nowhere. When I call to ask them to try and minimize barking I met with hostility from the front desk and usually a ""they are dogs there is nothing I can do about it"" attitude. I have also spoken with the owner who is nice and wants to find a solution but has not made any changes. 

I have reached out to Seattle Animal Control, but they said they only do residential. They told me to reach out to the Seattle Department of Construction and Permits.  

When I reached out to the Seattle Department of Construction and Permits, they told me to talk to Animal Control. After some back and forth, the SDCI was the correct place and I filled an official complaint but the only comment on the complaint is that the business has a permit and nothing about the barking.

I have also contacted the Seattle Police Department, but they said to contact Animal Control. 

I have no idea what to do. I am so miserable at home. I get severe headaches any time I work from home and do not wear my noise cancelling headphones, which I do not particularly want to be doing all of the time. 

I have seen that other people have also submitted complaints to the SDCI and there are multiple bad reviews on Google with the same complaints so I know other neighbors also feel this way. 

**Is there anything further I can do to resolve this?** Moving is not an option at the moment and I am sure I would take a financial hit due to the barking. I love animals and have a dog myself but am so exhausted and genuinely upset about the situation. "|seattle|2024|True|0

"So I’ll probably get trashed for this but I’m more or less curious about what others think the outcome will be.

My property manager informed me about the new changes for section 8 housing going into effect in March (landlords cannot deny tenants because of Section 8). My house is currently for rent (I’m off island but intend to return to my home in the future so I’m not selling) and we have one application that is Section 8.

It’s a family of I think 8 (4 adults, 4 children) and while my heart goes out to their situation, they have absolutely NO income other than their voucher and maybe unemployment/disability (temporary). So to reiterate, 4 adults and none of them work. 

Under the new rules in March, I would be forced to accept them as tenants regardless of their future inability to potentially pay and then due to Section 8 laws I would not be able to evict for some time if they didn’t pay rent. 

The house is not what one would classify as a starter home, I have worked very hard and for many years to be able to afford it. I know the legislature thinks they are encouraging socialism to protect families like these but here is what I think the end result will be and everyone in Hawaii is going to suffer… landlords are going to increase rent above vouchers to protect their investments to so they don’t have to worry about the potential headaches of Section 8. It’s going to drive up the rental market for everyone else looking for a home.

I know it seems callous but it is what it is. Does anyone else see this going differently (keeping the bleeding heart post out of it)?"|Hawaii|2022|True|0

"1. I recently moved from a location that had a choice of ATT Fiber internet and COX gigablast. At my old home, I received COX mailings that said ""Come back to COX and we will give you a 2 year worth of gigablast internet for 69.99 a month with no modem rental involved (Pano modem for free). So when I knew I was going to move to a place that only had COX for an internet option so I referenced that mailing to get the offer. They informed me that that offer was not available for that address. I informed them that you are not offering that deal to the address but to the consumer. So I asked them what if I was to get the offer to the old address that I was getting ready to move away from and they said sure, let’s sign you up. (no problem) Then a week later I was able to transfer my new service and keep the promotional rate. What this proves is that although it was the same market that I was moving my service to. COX purposely excludes offers to areas that they know that they DO NOT have relative competition (ie ATT GIG Fiber).
2. COX pano modem - This device does not work for me. “WHY?” you may ask. Well here is why. COX Pano modem is a modified Docsis 3.1 modem that takes away the guest network function of the modem and turns it into the COX HOTSPOT feature for others to drive by and utilize your internet service with the use of a COX username a password.[Access Cox Hotspots - On the Go, Nationwide | Cox Communications](https://www.cox.com/residential/internet/learn/cox-hotspots.html)A couple of points in regards to this is…A) For someone who doesn’t take password security seriously and has a weak password this allows for a compromised COX account to log in to the COX HOTSPOT guest wifi of your modem and go to town. To my understanding, it is doing nothing to your internal network in your main wifi other than sharing your wifi bandwidth. By default, the COX HOTSPOT feature is turned on and very little is said about it and COX does give you the ability to turn this feature off. But to the average person, they would not understand the fact that as you are on metered internet someone could come by and jump on your bandwidth and go to town.B) The modem’s wifi password is store in the app and if you ever have to reach out to tech support that info is readily available to them and to anyone that has a compromised user name and log in. In the days of IoT and financial security and the reasons to keep your network private to the user, you do not want that info floating out there for other people to use. You don’t want that info to float in front of some tech support person that could find an opportunity to exploit that information. Your WIFI password would not go past your router login.C) Needing the option for a guest network for visiting friends is important. I mean on my main network I have my home automation set up on the main 2.4 and if I was to give up my main network password (which is the only option for the COX pano modem) What if I wanted to change my password? Then I would have to change all my passwords to my streaming devices and IoT devices. Anyone that knows this experience understands that it is a tedious all-day job if you are a connected home. And then you spend the next couple of weeks finding connected things you have missed to get them working, With that in mind, I went to Best Buy to buy a 3rd party modem so that I would have the configuration options and privacy that I ask for in my home network. As I said earlier I was able to transfer my promotional price to my new location and as I found out the limitation to the modem and decided to supply my own device. I end up calling COX to supply the information to the new modem. The first modem (which was a DOCSIS 3.1) did not give me gig speed. Keep in mind when they installed the service into my home they installed a new drop to the home and a new outlet giving me a clean shot from the tap to the outlet to the modem. Using all the same wiring that the tech provided, with a finger tight connection to the modem, I was not receiving the speed I was expecting. I called COX tech support and I obliged them by going through their basic scripted routine of doing this and do that. Then it came to the part when the tech said “let’s send a tech out.” Then I was informed that if it is my equipment then I would be charged a service fee of so god awful amount UNLESS I subscribe to their “COX SERVICE PROTECTION PLAN”[Service Protection Plan Terms and Conditions | Cox Communications](https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/service-protection-plan-terms-and-conditions.html)This was foolish to recommend to me so I respectfully declined the service and went out and returned the modem and bought another one (Arris Docsis 3.1). When I was ready to call in that modem info I decided to use COX tech support via text and supply the modem info that way. That support agent informed me that if I was to change off the PANO modem to my own I would lose the promotional pricing. I said to myself HELL NO. And so I called in to provide the info where that tech said nothing to the fact that if I changed the modem to a 3rd party modem I would lose my promotional pricing. So this was shady as all get out to force me to utilize COX’s inferior equipment. I changed it anyway because I need the option for configurations and security.

I know this was a long rant but I wanted to let people know about the shadiness of OLD SCHOOL broadband. Companies that refuse to invest in their infrastructure to provide better service and also lobby Federal, State, and local governments to prevent the expansion of competition and better service to the people are screwing us and the future of the connected home. Over the past year, we have learned that broadband is VITAL to communication, health services, and education services also. I don’t want to hear of another parent that has to drive their kid to a Mcdonald’s parking lot to do their homework. Or of someone older parent with no ability to contact their family because of some quarantine to prevent them from getting sick or with no ability to connect their doctor when needed. GOD BLESS we are better than this. PLEASE ATT FIBER, PLEASE HURRY UP your billion dollars worth of infrastructure upgrades and for COX to blink. I am waiting to sign up and give COX the Johnny Cash Middle Finger salute to their service.

"TLDR at the bottom.

Full disclosure, I am an immigrant from Europe and have lived here in Texas for over a decade now. I am currently studying to be a real estate agent, and as I don't have my own land yet I have been learning a lot about being a land owner.

I guess I have a very simple, roman idea of real estate. ""Whoever's owns the soil, it is theirs all the way to Heaven and all the way to Hell"".  I believe once you are done paying the bank for your land (or if you bought it outright) the land is yours and yours alone. No renting the land from your government with the threat of repossession if you don't cough up. Especially with the artificial inflation of property value in a lot of places recently. A lot of people are forced out of their homes due to inability to pay taxes, homes that could have been in their families for generations. Just because your land appreciates a little because you made a good choice and/or investment in your land, people you have never met get to increase the amount you pay a year by an extraordinary amount. It is 100% taxation without representation.

I understand the need for taxes, it would be near impossible for towns, cities, and states to run without it. I guess the point I am trying to get to is property tax used to be used to pay for most municipal services. Makes sense right? But I live in a prominent city, I am paying separately for sewage, water access, waste removal, the roads we drive (which are filled with potholes), etc. On top of that, paying tax on it as well. I would argue those are, or at least were, considered municipal services that should be funded by property taxes. The Fire and Police departments, as well as schools seem like the big ones that our property tax pays for, and access to those services seem invaluable. 

I (thankfully) have never had to call the fire department. However me and my partner have had to call the police numerous times over the past few years. I had someone (I suspected the property managers) at the apartment I was staying in break into my garage and steal some things out of it. The property managers told me to reach out to the police and when I called them they asked if they had cameras on the property to which I replied they did not so they told me there was nothing they could do. We have had three incidents of a car hitting my partners car and driving off. Two of them we got the make, model, color, and license plate and each time they said they would have to call us back in a couple days to do a report (they did not call us back). When we called them to try and report it again they said that it had been a few days since it happened so its likely nothing would come of it and there was nothing they could do. Finally, there was a drunk driver on the highway, and we were on one of the skyways way up there and they were swerving all over the place. A couple times I thought they were going to crash into the sides and roll over. When they took their exit I thought they were going to ram directly into the split of the safety rail and narrowly overcompensated. I called the cops and after being on hold for 10 minutes I hung up. 10 minutes! If someone had broken into someones house that night or someone was being assaulted/attacked they would have had to wait AT LEAST 10 minutes for someone to answer the phone! 10 minutes after I hung up they then called and I told them what happened and they said they would keep a lookout. My partner had also called the police a few times while working in a retail store downtown because a homeless person was brandishing a weapon, stealing, or harassing people and they never turned up (this happened three times to her alone if I am not mistaken, and other times with her coworkers).

So the outrageous property taxes people pay are given mainly to the police, who will not help you if a crime has been committed nor answer your phone call in a timely manner, schools, and the fire department. 

This is not an argument about defunding or reforming the police, but more of they say they take all these property taxes for municipal services but it seems we get almost nothing back, and pay/get taxed separately for the rest of them that should be included . I would gladly pay a tax on the property at purchase similar to sales tax, or even increase my normal sales tax by a small margin, hell even pay property tax while I am still paying off my mortgage. But paying yearly all the way until you are 65 just to keep your home and land that you paid for is unreasonable to me. Government accountability and civilian oversight of spending should be instilled. Far too much money is being wasted on trivial things or going missing and the people who actually work for that money are the ones paying.

The one thing I loved about this country as a young kid was how much more free I thought it was compared to my home continent. As I grow older the veil is starting to lift it seems and I think people should start working towards setting things right. I come from a ""free country"" where people are arrested for simply thinking about something that's contrary to the governments narrative. And as an immigrant I can tell you with certainty, especially before covid and before politics had such a grip on people socially, America was a beacon for everyone back home. Everyone aspired to one day make it out to America, I know a lot of people back home still do. And I for one, one day, would want to be accepted as an American and want to be the shining example that a lot of the world thinks you guys are. Texas is so great, out of all the states I have ever been to Texas single-handedly is the best goddamn place out of all of them to me. 

So I would like to know what people could do to fight this? What can I do to fight this? I feel like true land ownership falls under life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As well as being a human right if you have worked for it. I do not think its unreasonable to think that the government has started to overreach and as a someone who wants to become a citizen and loves this state and country so dearly it also falls to me to try and keep them in check. So, what are the options? Who do you reach out to? I am not saying my ideas or beliefs are a universal fit or perfect, but I also do not think its too far off what a lot of people believe or would want. I would love to hear others thoughts on the matter.

"I am a new tenant in NJ and have been experiencing physical symptoms of what would relate to mold exposure. Upon removal of my upply vents, I found mold all over the insulation surrounding the air duct. Not only that, but the fiberglass insulation is torn and exposed. We cannot use our heat because when it’s turned on, I cannot stop coughing and it feels like something gets in my eyes. 
I should note that my roommate is young and lived here for a year before me and never cared to look or notice (although she also has extreme allergies but thought this was normal). 

Not sure what my steps are here. It’d be difficult to move out but I’m also convinced it would also be difficult to get the landlord to do anything about it. I’ve considered hiring a lawyer to make sure all our ducks are in order.

"I live in Colts Neck and I have two neighbors in their 40s.  Every single night they get together (sometimes throughout the day all day long) and go back and forth to each other’s apartments. The older one has three young children sleeping at home. I use to think it was just heavy alcohol and cocaine but now I think it might be crack or meth but I have no idea about those drugs and how to
Identify. I’ve tried to google for more information.

They never sleep, sometimes start cleaning nonstop and the one with kids leaves at 8-9am.  They talk about the stupidest stuff the entire time. Sometimes I don’t smell a smoke but just feel like my face, nose and throat are burning and start coughing uncontrollably. My eyes feel like they are on fire and it wakes me up every single night.

"I know there's no hard date but I assumed it'd be by phase two, parts of Virginia already reopened gyms at 30% capacity during their phase two reopening as well ([https://www.fredericksburg.com/phase-2-of-reopening-begins-friday-in-virginia-except-richmond-northern-virginia-northam-says/article\_631662e5-7ef0-50e7-b738-0b3b6bad9a36.html](https://www.fredericksburg.com/phase-2-of-reopening-begins-friday-in-virginia-except-richmond-northern-virginia-northam-says/article_631662e5-7ef0-50e7-b738-0b3b6bad9a36.html)). I thought VA, MD and DC were going to coordinate their opening efforts. I'm also assuming that phase two will require more prolonged analysis of virus rates than phase one since the second phase is more extensive. Does that mean that if cases still remain stable that phase three would likely not begin until the end of summer or the Fall?

I'll probably get downvoted to hell for passing judgement about this but, gyms should be allowed to reopen. I think it's unfortunate that Maryland is being so strict in this regard. There are creative ways to safely reopen fitness centers without jeopardizing public health, e.g., reduce the center's capacity, reduce other offerings (if there are additional amenities other than access to workout equipment), shorten the hours, only hold outdoor classes or keep classes virtual, space the equipment, increase cleaning, etc, etc."|Maryland|2020|True|0

"All: I am disheartened to see so many people making the reopening a political matter. Most of us agree that Governor Hogan has done a good job managing things, regardless of your preferred side of the aisle. Our state has been one of the best managed in the country, which is a real achievement considering the population density we have in certain areas, as well as our proximity to other states which have had major outbreaks. 

Everyone needs to remember that lockdown was never intended, nor would it ever have stopped the spread of the virus. It was intended to slow the transmission, which it has effectively done, so that the healthcare system would not be overwhelmed. We’re in a good spot now to begin a slow reopen of certain businesses, all of which need to maintain necessary protocols for safety. People need to get back to work, especially small business owners. 

Those who propose that “a life is worth any cost,” need to remember that that is unsustainable in perpetuity. We can’t simply expend every resource to try to save everyone, and eventually public policy needs to make decisions which are in everyone’s best interest. Whether that be tomorrow, or a week from now, eventually things must get moving again. I’d like to hope that the leaders are using the best information they have available, and acting accordingly. 

Remember too that federalism is important. Local communities being able to make their own decisions is exactly how the system is designed. If Howard County, which is very populated, wants to maintain restrictions longer, it is in their purview to do so. Garrett County has a totally different population density and needs, so they may choose to act differently. This is not Governor Hogan relinquishing responsibility, it is empowering local leaders to decide what is best for their community. 

I’d like everyone to please try to think rationally and not make things a political firestorm. We all want what is best, and we have to weigh the costs and benefits of any decision. I have a 2 month old at home and take all of this very seriously, however, a lockdown cannot last forever. Try to remember that public policy decisions have many factors involved, and that it is easy to criticize without complete information. Thanks!

Edit: Corrected purview. 

Edit: Wow awesome responses! Ranging from being called a Nazi to being thanked and messaged for a rational, reasonable post. I’m just glad that as of 4:19 PM that 328 people have liked and agreed. Hopefully y’all can be reasonable people moving forward, I know myself and most people I know want to be!"|Maryland|2020|True|0
"Serious question, and I'm looking for an honest answer.  I've heard during the entire pandemic from various local, national and state officials that testing is important.  For those who know about this, or can interpret it, are we looking at the ability to test more people or actually testing more people?

I'm not a doctor, but typically when I'm sick and need to be tested for something, I go to the doctor (with symptoms) and he recommends the test.  In fact, don't they recommend us to stay home if you are sick?  A healthy person probably isn't going to want to be tested, though they might if they were around known COV19.  But there's also going to be people who get the 'virus' and never get tested.

So my question is, when we say we need to ramp up testing, is that the ability to test x number of people, or the number of people tested.  I know this is odd to post in Maryland (but in a way it has to do with the pandemic that this country, state and world is struggling to deal with right now).  And like everyone else, MD is in the thick of it."|Maryland|2020|True|0
"Can’t Maryland reopen if we protect and isolate people in nursing homes, older people, and people with medical issues? Because why can’t a 20 year old go to the local mom & pop shop and consume goods, when they have almost no chance of falling prey to the virus?  

I would honestly prefer to buy my local goods that are right there just not allowed to shop there, instead of supporting amazon with already is flush with cash. I feel that my money would be better spent supporting my community rather than a corporation. 

I’m lucky enough to be deemed an “essential worker” by my partner has been looking for work, applying dozens of places and not hearing a word back from them. I can imagine how bad this can be for families who have lost everything and now have to be confined to their homes instead of being able to return to work and have a chance to regain their livelihood. Because regardless of this virus or not people are going to need money and the government cannot be the solution to everything, people will slip through the cracks as they always do.

I am laying in bed. My girlfriend asleep while I am wracked with anxiety and terror. 

This is not a 'woe is me' post. Something more akin to me trying to parse out my life in long-form and maybe get some advice along the way.

In October, last year, I moved here from Indiana. Not because I wanted to, as I was fleeing abuse from my family. We moved to her grandmother's house in Winter Garden, while her grandmother moved in with her boyfriend in Orlando. Win-win, I guess.

I am a 28 year old male that was making a decent living working as a forklift operator in an auto industry plant. Before moving here, I had never had a period of more than 2 days of being unemployed. I have been dealt a bad hand in life. I grew up in the rust belt, in poverty, with abusive parents. Hell, I am driving a shitty falling apart car from a Buy Here-Pay Here that still has $5500 to pay off. That is $221 every 2 weeks. Only recently can I say that I have begun to move on from my past hardships.

My girlfriend is amazing, even if her situation does not allow us to be financially stable. She is a student, which limits her options for work. Plus she has a severe bipolar diagnosis as well as anxiety, so working a normal job is not quite in the cards right now. I love her dearly, and I would have stayed in my abusive situation with little thought if it wasn't for her. 

Since moving here, I have found that the job market is insanely competitive. It took me a month to find a job once I was here. And even then it was a call center salesman for freaking vacation packages. I made minimum wage, and did not have the skills to close sales. Bills started piling up, and I left that gig. I felt dirty working there, a huckster with a friendly voice.

After that, I started working with a small laundry cleaning service. Contracted gig work, not unlike Uber Eats or Postmates. We did your laundry with pick up and drop off. My girlfriend helped with doing the actual laundry, while I spent most of my time delivering. Slowly, I began to realize exactly how messed up the business model for the company was, and how I was overall losing money by working there. It was at this point where I really started feeling the financial pinch.

Fast forward, I ended landing a job as custodial staff for one of the major theme parks in February. I had been out of work for a month or so, scared shitless about my bills piling up as they were. Collection calls coming in daily, because no one has sympathy for a man trying to rebuild his life. Being strict with my budget, I kept my girlfriend fed while I would skimp on myself to pay for gas, driving to and from work and her to and from school. I was slowly cutting into those backdated bills, thank God.

Fast forward again to Coronavirus. I knew we would shut down. Tourist destinations and pandemics do not mix. I was scared for unemployment because I knew I wouldn't qualify for Florida's system. At that point, I had no idea how bad it was, obviously, but I had been working for the company for less than 2 months. I would be lucky to not get laid off. 

Then we were furloughed. I thought ""Yay! At least I have a job to go back to!"" Then I CARES happened and I thought everything would be amazing. No worries about unemployment. I would receive SOMETHING to help us.

I have posted here before. I had an issue where it would not let me past a splash page on CONNECT. Well, I got through. Then I was deemed 'ineligible' with no way to appeal the decision. Last week I applied for the PUA benefits, but I have become so disheartened, seeing that less than 10000 people that have applied for PUA here were paid out, as of the last time I checked. 

So here I am, laying here, thinking about something I haven't truly thought of it 5 or more years. Suicide.

The stress has been eating me away. Day by day, I have looked at my accounts that are in the negative, our food stockpile that has been dwindling, job boards that show plenty of jobs available in call center vacation package sales but nothing substantive for someone like myself. Hell, I only truly quit smoking last year and I still have a slight cough from it, and I am overweight. Coronavirus scares me so much that I do not even want to step out of the house and see all of these people in my area not take this fucking disease seriously. My girlfriend's grandmother keeps sending me classifieds for jobs I don't qualify for, all because she thinks I am a freeloader.

Back home, friends got their unemployment quickly, and are still getting it. They are being smarter than Florida is about reopening. Doing so slowly. Anecdotally, people are wearing masks more than 75% of the time, from what I have heard, while here, old and young people largely do not care.

I lived in a small town and I could step outside and see the stars at night. I miss that so much, and I never realized how much I would. I miss my stable job that let me work hard and not worry about taking advantage of someone else. Hell, I miss the fact that $1 could buy you more than $1 here.

I know I am venting. I know there are so many things about Indiana I hated and if I were there today, I would wish that I was in Florida. But here, I have no chance to own a home with 2 bedroom apartments going for a minimum of $1200/mo. Where I was you could get that for $600-$800/mo. Here is takes me 2 hours to travel 30 miles, if I am lucky. Before it would take me 30 minutes.

I don't know if it is the bit of Midwesterner in me that screams that this life here is unnatural. I don't feel safe here. I don't feel cared for. The government is destroying that last little safety net I had, so I will probably lose my car, my phone, and pretty much anything else I need to hold a job in 2020. I am lucky I am not paying rent here yet, but once I am, I won't survive. In a utilitarian fashion, it may be easier to just die now.

I don't want pity. I know I made mistakes, plenty of which I did not write in here. I just want some guidance. I need a reason to see why life may be worth it here, why I didn't make a bad choice. I do not plan on committing suicide. I want to have a long, full, and healthy future with my girlfriend.

I know that the world is facing what could be described as the COVID Depression, one bigger than the Great Depression ever was. My story is not unique now, and it sure as hell will not be in the coming months/years. People that are doing well or passable now will be chipped away until they feel like me. 

Deep down, I do know that there is kindness in the world. I know that all people have a fundamental understanding of one another. Some people don't listen to that instinct, while most others do. I know that in my past, I was the one doling out the kindness in spades, until it nearly broke me. I have been the recipient as well.

All I ask for now is some advice. I cannot guarantee that I will be awake in the next few hours. Even with my anxiety, I am about to crash. No matter what, writing this helped me, at least a little. I can see where things happened, and even if I can't change them, it helps to know where I made mistakes. 

If you are reading this, thank you. I appreciate your time even reading my sad, frustrating post. I hope you never have to go through a situation like my own. 

Stay safe and stay healthy.

Edit: Wow. I really appreciate the reward. That is a first for me.

Just to let you all know, I am doing okay. I am mentally stable and I have no plans to act on those dark thoughts. Everyone is struggling right now, one way or another, and I want everyone lifted up, not just myself. If it comes down to it, I will make the hard decision and leave my position in the theme park for somewhere hopefully closer and in operation.

Edit 2: I just wanted to update you all. I am okay. I am in a better headspace than I was a few days ago. The anxiety comes and goes, but thinking of all the help you guys gave me, plus my girlfriend, really grounds me.

I am lucky for one thing. Yesterday I contacted my old workplace in Indiana. I honestly forgot I had a 401k there, and I am in the process of closing that account and getting the money. It isn't much, but it will staunch the bleeding until my PUA comes through. 

Again, thank you for your kind words of advice and help. I know none of you personally, but it really helps me see that we all ar we in this together."|Florida|2020|True|0
" In about late march, COVID-19 struck like a wildfire in South Florida where I live. I was taken off work by March 23rd, no paid leave because I'm on hourly pay. I got a call from my GM that I, she, and all employees who were with my manager on shift were forced to self quarantine for 14 days. My manager had allegedly contracted COVID-19, and even got the GM sick, in turn quarantining the restaurant and shutting down our operations. Roughly 2 weeks later my household was all sick with COVID-19, including myself. 

 I had contracted the virus and had a constant fever for nearly a week but nothing like my mother. The worst of my COVID spell was the headaches I suffered and the intense zap of all my energy, my fever reached a peak of 101°F(38.3°C) before settling down 5 days later. 

 My mother was aching in pain, sweating, with constant headaches, throwing up, she said she felt suffocated, something was trying to kill her. When she tried to go downstairs to get water she collapsed on the stairwell and nearly broke her back. I urged her to not put pressure on her body like that however she did not listen.

 She had an increasing fever that only seemed to get worse by the day, and she reached a peak at 104°F(roughly 40°C) by about April 8th. She was always screaming into the night saying ""ow.....Ow.....OW.....OWWWWWW"" and it only got louder with every ow she uttered. This continued every day and every night in random in random intervals.

 My grandparents were also in the household, and we couldn't afford them to get sick as there was little information how COVID travels from body to body at the time. We had them stay in their rooms however my grandfather was dealing with a stroke that had impaired his memory. He couldn't process the severity of the situation. 

My mom would go downstairs often, as would I and everybody else; it couldn't be avoided, we still needed to use the household. I tried to organize a schedule when who and what time bodies could go downstairs for whatever purpose, however no one really took it seriously. 

We sanitized surfaces the best we could but the spread seemed too powerful even with social distancing, even if it was meant to slow the process. Me and my sister left food by my grandparents door  and made dinner wearing gloves and avoiding touching raw food with any part of our bodies. We were very careful in preparation.

 I was always washing the oils off my hands for 20 seconds with soap under warm water, I made a routine and became very self concious of my actions like touching my face I did what I could to prevent spreading the virus on the chance I was still a carrier.

 My grandfather was showing unusual signs of coughing through early April, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 later in the month, including my grandmother. He was coughing loudly, not that my house is soundproof or anything, but you could hear it even from the backyard.

 He progressively got worse and worse every passing day, and more vicious the coughing sound grew as well. Around that time in early April he had lost all feelings in his legs. I even came into the room risking exposure because he couldn't get up. 

 He had stayed in the bathroom all night, sometimes hours on the floor, he was completely disoriented confused, and didn't ask for help when he clearly needed it, nor wanted to receive it. 

 When I reached out to carry him up he didn't actually seem to realize he was on the floor, he acted as if nothing happened, he didn't realize he had fallen. My grandmother was in such a state of shock with this sudden development she had called the ambulance.

 When they came however they said they wouldn't admit him until he had proof diagnosis of COVID-19 symptoms. I was told by my parents I shouldn't help my grandfather because I can get sick too, but I couldn't just leave him like that, you don't do that to family. 

 They both tested positive for COVID-19 the next day.           The next day we had gotten a Walker from our neighbor, and a cane too to see if he could walk with those, but he actually pushed those away, and didn't acknowledge them, even though it was next to his bad.

 My grandmother was fighting with him all day, trying to battle his memory, the coughing, tired of all the unheard warnings and falling over, she called the ambulance again roughly 6 AM in the morning and this time, he was admitted to the hospital. Later that day she was also called an ambulance for herself to the hospital. She claimed she just couldn't breathe anymore and she was in pain all day trying to get air in her lungs. 

 2 days later we heard nothing from them or the hospital on their ongoing condition so we reached out to them ourselves. Turns out the hospital got our papers mixed up with someone else's, they had confused us with another family, which I didn't think was possible, I thought medical facilities were well- organized.

 We tried to call my grandmothers cell but we couldn't reach her either. We couldn't reach our own family, and it was a nightmare. We were kept on hold on the phone nearly all day listening to those garbage machine written promotions for the hospitals, and finally got through to someone just around 5 PM, around the time the hospital would end visiting hours. They had connected us back with my grandparents without issue this time. 

 A quiet day had passed at home, and later on we had called to check up on both of my grandparents in the hospital. Both were in separate ICUs, receiving treatment. 

 When we spoke to the doctor about their condition, they said my grandmother was dealing with pneumonia induced by COVID, but as for my grandfather, my father had received a call from the doctor at the hospital that he wasn't going to make it. 

 He had recieved damage throughout his entire body, and the damage to his lungs was irreparable. He was on oxygen, and he wasn't able to breath naturally without the life support machine. He was dying. For a dying man he had a lot of energy stored up though. He managed to put up quite a fight in the hospital, I heard his arms had to be restrained and his arms were tied down. My grandfather was a fighter.  

 My mom agonized harshly over this news, she would be losing her father, and had made a difficult call with my grandmother out of commission, to set him up in a hospice. Several days later my grandmother was discharged from the hospital and came home in a burst of energy.

 She had conversed with my mother about her decision of calling a hospice, agreeing that she didnt want to see him suffer, and to make him as comfortable as possible before passing on. She had shut herself in her room for the day though, I can't imagine the emotions she must have felt. The next couple of days passed like they were nonexistent. On the 15th, the hospice called and set us up for a call with my grandfather who was in deep sleep to say any last words. It was the most difficult thing I ever had to do in my entire life. 

 The next day 20th birthday came around on the 16th. My birthday was solemn, quiet, odd...it passed fast, there wasn't much I could do with the state completely shut down so I just gamed, and watched hulu on my laptop like I usually do. 

 We had gotten a cake, and celebrated, even with all the sadness surrounding us in this horrid time of the month. I was shown pictures of my grandfather from my grandmother, and was given a card they had prepared in advanced before my birthday, it was the last card I would ever recieve from my grandfather. 

 The next day my grandfather had passed away at an age of 84 years old on the 17th right after my 20th birthday. My mom fell apart before collecting herself and reaching out to the only funeral service in the area. 
We couldn't have an open procession because of the law, and all we could do was really send him off. We ran into a problem because the funeral service tried to charge us an outrageous price $5000 dollars.

 They were clearly trying to scam us all because funerals were happening quite frequently with COVID deaths all around. No reception, no procession, just a quiet sendoff, and they charged $2500 dollars to pick up the body, then $2500 dollars to bury it. We couldn't afford to bury my grandfather and that began the process of another nightmare. The other choice was to cremate it which my mom wouldn't budge on. 

 In the end we had set up a barter arrangement and sold his grave plot. His area was very prestigious and came with many ideal perks for a nice burial, so the funeral home couldn't miss this incredulous opportunity for them to sell it off, so they copped all the prices over the deal with another cemetery. Me, my mother, and father, as well as my 2 younger sisters and I said goodbye to my grandfather this time in person on April 21st, my grandmother couldn't attend the funeral because she was placed on oxygen at home.

As of this time my house is COVID free and my grandmother is off the oxygen, however the loss we've suffered has changed my family forever. The timeframe of these circumstances continue to blind my mind every time I think about it. My grandfather was a very strong man and didn't deserve to go out the way he did, it wasn't a fitting end for him.

 My take from this for everyone is please stay home and avoid contact with people if at all possible, COVID-19/Coronavirus is not a joke. Please wear masks outside and stay indoors to reduce the impact of either contracting, or spreading this pandemic. As a society we need to put aside our personal pleasures for the sake of the world, and human history to move on, otherwise we may never be able to get back to enjoy our daily lives. These times call for us to be appreciative of what we already have, and to set aside our greed.

My roommate is starting her job as a nurse working at a main hospital in downtown Manhattan this week. She basically told me not to come back and that I should go somewhere else. I know that I can legally go back, but I am at high risk to the virus because of underlying conditions. 

I am currently in another state and am deciding when to go back to my apartment. I don’t really have anywhere to go and feel nervous about going back knowing my living situation puts me at a high risk of contracting COVID-19.

I found a studio that is around the same price that I am currently paying but can’t afford 2 rents (would be banking on finding someone to sublet).

If anyone has some advice as to what to do, please let me know. I will be returning to NYC at the end of April because I cannot extend the stay at where I am any longer than that. Thanks in advance"|NewYorkCity|2020|True|0
"In general going to the GP for me is pretty rare. I am lucky enough to say that I am generally in good health. I have noticed over the years though, that there is a real lack of care, professionalism and expertise going into the work being carried out by GPs. 


I occasionally go down with a cough or something similar in which case the GP appointment usually takes less than 5 minutes and predictably i leave with a script for antibiotics I could have probably prescribed for myself. 

Lately I have had some recurring tonsilitis. A new experience for me and a pretty awful one. Its gotten to the point that i can feel it coming before it really takes hold. 

I got it bad this last friday while at work. So once i was able to get home I booked in a random GP who was open after hours and went in to say what my symptoms were and what I had experienced lately. 

Random GP says its viral and NOT tonsilitis. Should be gone in a few days. Offered no medication or treatment other than to spray my throat with diflam which hasnt provided much relief. 

I was surprised but thought ok. Maybe it feels so bad because of the recent run of issues i have had? Meanwhile I am struggling to eat or drink and I am barely sleeping due to the pain.

3 days later. I have deteriorated and decide to head to a different doc and get a 2nd opinion. Doc takes one look and says tonsilitis. Is shocked why I left it so long based on my recent history with it. So they gave me a script for antibiotics like I had expected from the first doc. When I asked if I could get somethibg for the pain and to help me get some sleep, Doc suggested I do a throat gargle. So no food no sleep for another day at least.

Both exams lasted less than 5 minutes each. The first doc who missdiagnosed me charged 70 dollars for the pleasure. The second doc who I expect has now diagnosed me correctly and provided me a script for the meds required to get better, bulk billed. 

I think that means that for his 4 minutes of time he made $39.95 where as the other doc made $70 for the same time and a misdiagnosis. 

And we are all being told to feel sorry for GPs and how badly underpaid they are? In my opinion they are the most OVERPAID professionals in Australia. 

Maybe if they showed actual care and expertise that wouldnt be the case but they are by and large doing very simple work and doing a very bad job of it."|melbourne|2023|True|0
"I am from Auckland, New Zealand and have lived there my whole life. It’s climate is oceanic with high humidity whereas Melbourne has low humidity and also an oceanic climate and has a similar temperature and weather variation to Auckland; although I have read drizzles are far common here then massive downpours. I just arrived yesterday and have spent all my time in the CBD and Southbank area. The air quality seems to be a step down from what I am used to back home and I have been getting random albeit increasingly tense coughing fits. I am suspecting being surrounded by the sea breezes Pacific and Tasman Seas in Auckland makes a huge difference to air quality compared to the breezes from Port Philip and the Bass Strait?

"Currently looking for a place to rent in Melbourne. 3 weeks ago I submitted my first application for a place and it's still pending. 2 weeks ago I submitted another one (again, still pending). 1 week ago I submitted another so I could have a back-up if the first 2 didn't go through.

This week I have another short list of houses to look at (5 in total).

Now I've started seeing the same people at inspections (although there is only ever a handful - certainly not the crowds you hear about) and it turns out we have applied for some of the same houses. Out of all the applications we have made one of us should get the good news that we can move in however we all still need to keep looking while we wait. 

Only a few years ago, you would hear back within a few days of applying. Now we are made to wait and wait while the REA asks for more and more information (seriously, why don't you just ask me to squat and cough! You have every other piece of information about me!).

Surely keeping applications going for longer than a week makes it look like the crisis is bigger than it is? By taking a long time to let people know of a decision, it means more people at other inspections and more enquiries about other rentals. I think it might also be used to make people offer more than the advertised rent just so they can have a decision made.

And what do the owners think about having all these applications sitting there without a decision? Do they hope it will increase the rent? Are they waiting for someone who earns more money? 

What do others think?"|melbourne|2023|True|0

"Hey Reddit-

&#x200B;

I love city trees. There's nothing like walking down a tree lined block on a beautiful day or a hot day and being shaded!

BUT

One of the things that irks me to no end is seeing those unsightly green gator bags around a mature tree or a tree that was planted well over a year ago. They are really only good for the first year of planting so that the young tree gets additional water and they do no good if you don't fill them up. SO if you own, rent or live in an apartment building or work at a business that has these skirts around the trees PLEASE please please remove them (or tell a maintenance worker, groundskeeper or civic association if it's a public space).

&#x200B;

Keeping them on will: 

\- induce trunk rot, decay and mold

\- provide the right environment for insect infestation

\- choke the trunk

\- provide a place for people to shove trash into.

&#x200B;

They are NOT protecting your tree from dog urine, if you want to protect from that put a barrier and/or a sign (please don't nail/staple it into the tree though). So if you lift one up that's clearly been there a while you will see the trunk inside is going to be moist and darker in color, insects may scurry around and trash may fall out. Trees never needed these before and they really don't need them now.

&#x200B;

TIPS:

&#x200B;

\- MULCH!!! Mulching is a super simple thing to do and benefits greatly. Mulch should NOT cover the root flare, it should not look like a mound/volcano- it should be a ring around the trunk...like a moat. Your tree's root flare should not be buried, choked or stifled! Unlike other garden plants, tree roots don't need to be buried deep. 

AND....Every Philly Resident can get up to 30 gallons of FREE mulch from the Recycling Center in West Fairmount Park! 

https://www.phila.gov/services/trees-parks-the-environment/get-organic-materials/

Please make sure you get mulch made out of trees/decomposed plant material. Some mulch is just wood chips. Mulch is meant to keep the moisture in the soil and as it breaks down it releases nutrients into the soil. Mulch made from construction wood will not help with that.

&#x200B;

\- Tree Philly and Philadelphia Horticultural Society's Tree Tenders Program are the best planting services in the city. Not only are they free (donations greatly appreciated though to keep them going), they are done by city arborists and tree loving volunteers. They plant bare root trees, trees are selected for proper sidewalk cuts, height and canopy depending on your sidewalk and what's around it (like overhead wires). 

&#x200B;

This link will show you the Tree Tender group in you neighborhood and the contact if you want a tree or a replacement tree:

&#x200B;

[https://phsonline.org/programs/tree-tenders/tree-tenders-maps/](https://phsonline.org/programs/tree-tenders/tree-tenders-maps/)

&#x200B;

Try not to plant from a private company, they are more expensive, tend to plant burlap bagged trees (these have a higher mortality) and they will often use gator bags.

&#x200B;

\- Tree ties are only necessary when the tree is establishing its root system. After the first few years or if the tree seems sturdy enough you can remove these ties. They will be another thing that will choke your tree if left indefinitely. 

&#x200B;

\- Prune dead branches and new growth (suckers) coming from the bottom or mid level of the trunk, this will help your tree focus its energy into it's healthy foliage.

&#x200B;

\- If your tree has a small plot, don't plant other things with it, especially hostas and shrubs because they will compete for water and nutrients in a small space and lead to tree death. Flowers are ok though and could also give you indication of water needs.

&#x200B;

\- If you have any kind of hose access or even just a bucket, water your tree when you can. Newer plantings need 15 gallons a week! When a tree is covered almost entirely by sidewalk it's not getting much water into the ground. Sometimes I wonder how people could concrete a tree almost up to its base and not wonder how its supposed to get water. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

MISCONCEPTIONS:

&#x200B;

\- Misconception 1: Trees only break up sidewalks when there's not enough space for roots. It's very common to see in Philly a lot of older trees that have upheaved sidewalks or where the roots are bulging out of the concrete. This is because old city planners and residents gave trees NO growth room and also chose trees that grew over three stories for residential streets. The best thing to do is give the tree as much ground space as you can give. It will be able to take more water and be less of a headache later having to repave or deal with a clunky sidewalk. As you may have noticed the West Philadelphia neighborhoods around Baltimore Ave have trees everywhere and you'll notice the curbside strip is not concreted allowing for less sidewalk breaking, greater root expansion and more access to ground water for the tree.

&#x200B;

\- Misconception 2: Trees DON'T grow into pipes that do not have cracks and holes in them already. As you may know, many of our street trees have limited access to ground water and a lot of our city pipes are old and may have cracks in them. Once there is a crack this invites a tree root to grow into it. It will not grow into a pipe that's intact though.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I want to see trees thrive as best as they can in this environment. As our area becomes prone to warmer temps and more storms, trees mitigate utility costs with shade and cooling, provide another place for storm water to go and adds value to your property.

&#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope it helps, perhaps we can start a productive conversations and questions about increasing and protecting the tree canopy in the city."|Philadelphia|2019|True|0
"Currently in tx in a HCOL area. Am now able to work remote now and trying to figure out if it's worth relocating to a lower COL area.  
In a few months I will have $280k saved. With that I can:  
a) pay off current house, or   
b) use it to pay most/all of new house. will sell/rent current house of course

What I'm trying to figure out is: should I pay off the current house and accept the high property tax or deal with the headache and cost of moving for lower housing costs.



current house:  
\* property tax/hoa/ins after mort is paid: $721/mo  
-if I have to rent it, will prob cost me $200/mo



new house:  
\* prop tax/hoa/ins after mort is paid: $351-$442/mo  
-$270k-$300k



Figure the move will cost $12k-25k.  
If I save $4,440/yr that's a break even around 2yr-5yr.  
Am I missing anything in this equation?  


Making the following assumptions:  
-quality of life will be similar in new house/area  
-mostly a financial question in this context  
-writing off any loss on current house as sunk cost  
-No state tax in tx so they nail you on prop tax. The lower COL & higher interest rates even out so the monthly payment will be about the same."|texas|2024|True|0
So i've heard some people say Covid is spreading around lately. But this is... weird. It's all very mild, and the symptoms are more annoying than debilitating. Beginning around July 1st, I had a dull headache that lasted weeks. Every day, about a month. On a scale of 1-10, it was about a 2 and was usually on the right, but sometimes on the left. And I occasionally had pressure in my eye or jaw, always one side or the other. Well, that finally went away about last week. But now my stomach is bugging me. Again, it's very dull. Last night I had that feeling that I was about to vomit for a few seconds. Today my stomach is slightly worse but still dull. Its not like i'm in agonizing pain, it's more annoying than anything. And my appetite is definitely decreased. But drinking water or soda doesn't really bother me. But I can still eat. My nose is also stuffed up but again, very slightly. Although, a couple weeks ago, when I still had the headache, I took a nap during the day and I woke up like a couple hours later and my nose was just full of snot, like when you have a cold, but it went away after about 30 minutes. I have phlegm, but again, very lightly. Not the usual shit ton when you're sick with a cold and hacking up chunks, but more of a, you know that its there, and you can feel it when you swallow, but it's no big deal.|texas|2024|True|1
"Can anybody on this subreddit explain to me how our politicians/compassion centers line their pockets with little to no regard for patients? To get a medical card in this state you now have to pay a hundred and twenty-five dollar kickback to the state. To only then, pay an exorbitant amount at the compassion centers. sixty dollar quarters for their low tier flower. Maine medical goes for forty a quarter whilst Quebec boasts twenty six dollar quarters. You're better off going to your local farmer or someone who can give it to you for much cheaper. So, two hundred dollars for a card to then only pay grotesque prices at the dispensaries? I have to say our medical program here is C O R R U P T. And they all know exactly what they are doing but don't seem to care.  Why is there no consideration for the patient? Does money truly talk? Sick of bullshit programs run by the state.

"Signed my lease June 7, 2023. Lost my job 3 months later and could not pay rent. Started a personal training job that does not pay enough. Reached out to resources and applied to TRUA Feb 2024. Kept calling for updates and it was still pending being assigned to a reviewer. Received court summons and could not go when I had the stomach flu. Didn't call because stupid and useless. Called TRUA to expedite the application and the woman said she expedited it in the system. Turns out, you have to upload your documents into the portal. Me, missing research again.

This past Wednesday I had an eviction scheduled notice on my door from the sherrif. Today is Monday night. I called TRUA again to plea them to expedite becuse it's happening. The man who answered today told me to upload my form into portal. I threw it away over the weekend, figuring it's too late. Again, stupid. Rushed over to the courthouse and got there 5 minutes after closing. 

I'm waking up first thing in the morning, going there, uploading all documents and calling TRUA after and praying they can get through before the sherrif comes. If not, I will be homeless.

"If you are going out in stores and public places right now with a persistent cough YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. Even if it is just a cold or allergies why risk putting an elderly or at risk person's life in danger? It is also possible to have the virus without getting the disease (two separate things) so your cough and sneeze could be spreading the virus even if you aren't sick with the disease.

In South Korea - the only place effectively doing mass testing across all demographics (Philadelphia is only testing elderly and at risk patients for the most part) - an [alarming number of people ages 20-29 tested positive](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102730/south-korea-coronavirus-cases-by-age/) despite showing no symptoms or only very mild symptoms like a slight cough. You do not need to have a fever or feel ill in order to have the virus. Covid-19 is not an influenza.

I know that nobody wants to admit they might be infected. It's probably scary to admit that to yourself. But all it takes is 1 cough to potentially infect and kill someone who is at risk. There is no acceptable excuse to be out in public coughing right now unless you are making your way to the hospital or have been tested negative.

And for those who are going to call this post alarmist you're correct. Wake the f\*ck up.

"As you might have heard, several North Alabama schools are cancelling classes because so many students have the flu. ([https://www.al.com/news/2019/01/north-alabama-schools-closing-because-of-flu.html](https://www.al.com/news/2019/01/north-alabama-schools-closing-because-of-flu.html)) 

I'd never heard of a school having ""flu days,"" but apparently it happens here. Most of the neighbors and colleagues I've discussed this with tell me that they are also personally against the flu vaccine because, they believe, it causes the flu.

"In Melbourne's lockdown, I have been learning to cook low Fodmap meals for my wife.  We love to go out to different food places but unfortunately, she keeps getting sick most of the time we eat out.  Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore so I focus on making low fodmap meals for her.  This time I adapted a recipe for a vegetarian lasagne.  I have listed brands that I have used that I know are low Fodmap (according to the Monash Fodmap app).  It's quite yummy and all ingredients are easy things to be sourced in Melbourne!

I'm no Master Chef, just some bloke trying to make his wife something nice to eat and I thought I'd share it with fellow Melburnians.

Ingredients for Tomato Sauce:

6 medium peeled & diced carrots

2 diced zucchinis

2 diced eggplants

2 large peeled & diced sweet potatoes

2 cans of champignon mushrooms

1 bottle (700g) Val Verde passata (I think Aldi brand is also Fodmap too)

140g Leggos tomato paste

400g can of SPC crushed tomatoes

A handful of spinach leaves

1/4 cup olive oil

200g spring onion (green leaves only)

1 cup of red wine (any will do)

125g Philadelphia cream cheese lactose-free

&#x200B;

Ingredients for Bechamel Sauce:

2 cups of milk

50g gluten-free flour

50g Nutalex

Pinch of nutmeg

Pinch of salt

&#x200B;

Ingredients for Building the lasagne:

San Remo gluten free lasagne sheets

Liddle's Pizza mix grated lactose-free cheese

&#x200B;

Tomato Sauce Method:

1) Put diced carrots, zucchini, eggplant & sweet potato into a roasting dish.  Spray with cooking spray or drizzle with olive oil.  Sprinkle salt on vegetables then roast in the oven at 180C for 40 minutes

2) When vegetables are finish roasting, put olive oil in a large pot and get the oil hot.  When hot, put the spring onion in and cook until fragrant.  Drain the champignon mushrooms and if already diced/sliced from the can put them straight into the pot and stir for about 5 minutes.

3) Pour the roast vegetables into the pot, stir for a few minutes.  Pour the red wine in and turn heat down to med-high and keep cooking until the boozy smell goes away.

4) After the boozy smell is gone, add the passata, tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. Stir for a minute then throw in the spinach leaves.  The mixture will be quite thick so add 1 litre of boiling water then put on low heat for 2 hours.

5) After cooking on low heat for 2 hours, cut up the lactose-free Philadelphia cream cheese into small chunks and throw it into the mix.  Mix for a little while until all the little chunks dissolve.  The mixture will be a rich orange-red colour.  Add salt to taste.

&#x200B;

Bechamel Sauce:

I use Vincenzo's plate's recipe, but substitute Nutelex for butter and gluten-free plain flour for the plain flour:

[https://youtu.be/Gvnjbf7UbNY](https://youtu.be/Gvnjbf7UbNY)

The important thing about this part is to make it just before you build the lasagna. You want it a little runny and not too thick.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Building the lasagne.

I don't think I am the most correct but I build it this way:

1) Grease the pan with olive oil.  Add the tomato sauce lay about 1cm thick.  Put on a layer of lasagne sheets.

2) Put another layer of tomato sauce and then pour some bechamel sauce around the layer.  Sprinkle a LITTLE shredded cheese on top of that.  Add another layer of lasagne sheets.

3) repeat step 2 until you run out of lasagne sheets.  The top layer you want is only the tomato sauce about 1 cm thick.

4) Cook in oven at 180C for 40 min covered with foil.  Remove foil and sprinkle with shredded cheese and cook for another 10-15 mins.

&#x200B;

You will also end up with a lot of tomato sauce.  I also use this on pasta or baked potatoes, it's quite yummy!  As for the lasagne, my wife can tolerate 1 10cm x 10 cm slice no problem.  Hopefully, this works out for you!

"Hi All

&#x200B;

So i drive a lot for work, i have a company car (a hilux) and use it to make deliveries all over south eastern melb (have couriers to service the rest of vic and aus). Today an incident happened, wasnt the first time and wont be the last. About 15 minutes ago i was driving down dandenong/Governor road. Speed limit was 80 and i was driving 80, not a km more. Crazy person in a mercedes behind me decides the speed limit isnt good enough for her (at least i think it was a her, didnt get too good a look tbh) and starts tailgating and flashing her high beams in an attempt to get me to speed up

&#x200B;

Firstly the speed limit is there for a reason, to keep all drivers and pedestrians SAFE. I take that shit very seriously Secondly i drive a company car and the fines are substantially more than if it were a privately owned car (sure theres an easy loophole around that, but that isnt the point). I will not under any circumstances break the speed limit or any other road safety laws, especially not for someone behind me who doesnt wanna drive the speed limit.

&#x200B;

So if some asshole tailgates me my response is usually to drive slower. This isnt because i wanna annoy the tailgater (i mean it does often have that affect, but thats a bonus imho, just some gravy). The reason is because if i need to break in an emergency i dont want some asshole to slam into me at full speed.

&#x200B;

Today when that mercedes tailgated me, i dropped my speed to 70. TBH i wouldve gone down to 60 or even 50 (it was raining), but i also had somewhere to be and i figured 70 would be fine as i was keeping some distance between the car ahead of me. The result of this was the tailgater who needed to turn right on springvale road wound up missing a green light (had she not flashed me repeatedly and driven up my arse i wouldve still been driving 80 and she wouldve made that turn easily). Since i was driving straight i rolled down my window to give her a wave as i drove past (i also gave her the finger just before that, when she got into the right turn only lane and overtook me, speeding towards the lights).

&#x200B;

Now this type of shit happens to me on an almost weekly basis. Thats in addition to other shitty driving (folks who dont indicate properly, im talking about you!) and im pretty damn sick of it. So tailgaters, if youre driving up someones ass and they drop 10 or 20km. If you want em to speed back up again back the hell off and give them some space. (and non tailgaters, if youre sick if this behaviour too, please do what i do. Maybe theyll get the message eventually)

&#x200B;

Also, to the crazy mercedes lady. if you are reading this I dont care if you were in a hurry, i dont care if you think the speed limit is too low for that road, i dont care about anything you have to say (unless its ""im sorry for driving like an asshole""). If you try to make me break the speed limit it will not end well for you.

&#x200B;

That is all /rant

&#x200B;

editL to those of you who think youre not allowed to be in the right hand lane..... are you all very stoned??? and if so why dont you fucking share??? Seriously this is a normal road, not a highway, not a freeway. Not somewhere where the speed limit is 100+. The right lane here was NOT a designated overtaking lane and people drive the speed limit in it all the fucking time. I did nothing wrong or illegal, if you truly think youre allowed to speed in the right lane, please do the rest of us a favour and stay off the fucking road. 

&#x200B;

Also to any of you who wanna say the speedo is incorrect. I honestly dont fucking care. The speedo says 80 then i drive 80. 

Edit 2:

Oh ffs I’m done arguing this. To those who think I belong in the left. That is ONLY for roads OVER 80. Not roads where the limit is 80. Next time you’re on Nepean take a look around and tell me how many folks driving the limit are sticking to the left unless overtaking

And to those saying I should use a gps app to determine my speed…. Guys if I get pulled over for speeding coz my Speedo says 90 and my gps says 75 the excuse “but my gps said I was okay” will not hold up on court and Google will not pay my fine

To folks arguing either or both points all I can say is “fuck off”

That is all, I’m done engaging you guys in pointless arguments

edit 3: third and final. ive turned off notifications, will be ignoring ALL replies to this as ive got better shit to do. Just here to clarify a few things.

Firstly i was driving the limit, exactly 80 and not a hair over. THEN SHE STARTED TAILGATING ME, and only then did i slow down (AGAIN, i slowed down in order to ensure i could stop safely in an emergency, not with the purpose of annoying her).

secondly, she was tailing me for over 10 minutes. its not like this was a 200m thing where she wanted to make a light. 

thirdly, the left lane was clear, if she was in an emergency shed have overtaken me. she coudlve done so quite easily.

and finally, to everyone still bitching and moaning that the right lane is for turning and overtaking only.... please fuck right off because youre speaking nonsense and im not the only one who thinks so.

oh and special mention to the cunt who said brown people shouldnt drive. Fuck you with the fat end of a pineapple

"As the situation is inevitably worsening, I would like to share some of our views and the Chinese side of the story. I feel like the media is not really sharing much about the situation other than numbers and how people are being isolated for treatment, so I hope this provides some insight.

(Furthermore, I would like to voice some of my personal thoughts on the situation below as well.)

A little about me:

I’m currently a uni student here at UniMelb, and I’ve lived here in Australia since I was very young, so I would like to say I’m pretty familiar with Australian culture. I’m very attached to Chinese culture as well, and my girlfriend is currently in China and is coming back to resume uni (btw, not from Wuhan).

**The coronavirus, how did this happen?**

I’m definitely not any medical expert, but from Chinese sources and Weibo (our Twitter), it seems to be: Bats, wildlife, people dumb enough to eat them without any precaution.

Please. Don’t suddenly get this misconception that us Chinese are bat-eating monsters. The majority of us eat the same meats as you do (while quite a lot do like eating organ meats, it’s still the same animals), with the rare few that like to take it to the extreme.

For the Aussie-equivalent, we all eat poultry, beef, pork and seafood, some like to experiment the kangaroo and crocodile. And then pops out this guy who boils this kookaburra or fries a wombat. This is “the guy” we’re talking about, who started this.  (only for illustrative purposes)

**All the Chinese are suddenly wearing facemasks, are they sick?**

The whole point of this disease that is making this situation horrific, is that for the first few days or more (don’t credit me on this, refer to medical sources), we don’t know. The symptoms only show after being infected, and by that time you can’t even count how many people you’ve spread it to.

A few points that I hope are clear:

If we haven’t returned to China during this Lunar New Year, we most likely have been staying in Australia prior to the virus. Most of us should be fine.

We are worried about the people who have returned after the virus outbreak, and before the airport checks and government putting more attention to the situation.

We are wearing masks to protect ourselves from others, while at the same time not wanting to infect others if we do have the virus and symptoms haven’t shown.

(Please don’t be rude and make fun of the face masks. It’s happened during the last few days and this is one of my motivations of making this post.)

We encourage you all to take some precautions on this as well, Chinese or non-Chinese.

**Is it rude to stay at a distance to the Chinese right now?**

While I’m in no place to represent everyone and it really depends on each situation, I personally wouldn’t mind it.

As long as we all stay respectful and don’t make rude comments and weird looks, we’re fine. Hell, we’re staying distances from each other, not to mention others.

In all seriousness, if a Chinese is close to you that is coughing without a mask, leave, get cleaned up and take disinfection precautions.

**What do we think of the situation?**

We are more infuriated than anyone about this situation right now. The timing could not be any worse. Everyone’s hyped up for our New Year’s celebrations, everyone’s anticipating for the huge movies that are coming out, everyone’s shopping for gifts and decorations.

All of a sudden, we’re encouraged to stay home, transportation services have closed down, and the hit movies have all been withdrawn until further notice.

(Side story: A popular actor/director Zheng Xu has released his movie completely free online to support the situation and encourage everyone to stay home. Sure, there are sponsorships and deals and stuff, the box office would’ve still been much more than that. What a lad.)

Imagine all of Melbourne being ready for New Years, then suddenly the fireworks are cancelled, all the bars and restaurants and shops have been told to close, and all are encouraged to stay home. Same deal.

Especially for the people in Wuhan, who have no idea that there are people eating bats, and have probably planned travels after New Year’s. They are now completely locked in the city. It’s pretty much like the Simpsons where that dome is on Springfield, but now it’s happening for real. Not to mention all the doctors, nurses and others who are risking their lives and giving up their time with family for New Year’s to stop the virus.

People are pissed, people are ranting all over Weibo about why people are eating bats (or not taking any precautions for eating them), people are praying for their family and Wuhan to get better soon.

**What’s going to happen now?**

Well the virus outbreak has already begun and it’s most likely going to get worse. A main reason is that the governments reaction times are arguably slow. (However, I do understand that it would be very controversial to take any large-scale action in China at an early stage during the Lunar New Year Period, and Australia is too busy sorting out the fires. But the main focus of this post isn’t about any politics or backstory, so I won’t go any more into that.)

China’s going on full power to stop the virus (to put this in perspective, a 1000-patient hospital is getting built, in 6 days). Vaccines are getting looked into, from professionals in both China and other countries around the world. I guess another positive note for us Australians, is that most viruses are much weaker in hotter temperatures, so the situation would most likely be resolved in a few months.

Thanks for reading up to this point. I hope this has given you an insight on our side of the story. As the situation is directly pointing at the Chinese, I really hope that the situation is more transparent and there are no conflicts and miscommunications about this. Please share this to other social platforms and friends so more people can understand our view on the virus.

Thanks again,

a Chinese student who loves Melbourne.

Hi guys, novel question for you: Do I need to do anything about a possum that has decided to situate itself in my garden during the day? I watched it from my back door walk across the lawn and under our deck where it has stayed despite my attempts to scare it off. Is it likely to be sick or dying if it is 'out' in daylight? Is there an organisation or service that I should inform? Could it be just putting up under my deck for the day if it might have lost its usual sleeping place?|melbourne|2020|True|0

Hey y’all, bit of a long story, but hear me out. I live pretty close to QVM and I was wondering whether anybody there sells vapes for cheap. Note, I don’t really think vaping is super cool or anything but I do cosplay as a hobby once or twice a week and one of my favourite characters to cosplay smokes (Spike from Cowboy Bebop, if you were curious :D). I’ve tried making fake cigs with like parsley and empty tubes but that shit makes me sick as hell, plus it stinks. And I don’t want all the really bad shit from a real smoke in my body because my Dad smoked and, well, just no thanks. I looked at buying one of those stage cigarettes as well, like with the little led light in the end that they use in stage productions, but those are hella expensive as well. So I’m just looking for a cheap and easy vape that won’t really enjoy  much use, figured somebody around the corner from me at Vic Market might be selling one.

"In case you wanted to know why I'm asking:

My father needs to travel to see my sick grandfather, and he needs to board his dog for a bit. I can't help as I'm not allowed to have pets, even visiting pets.

Anyway, he does not hate pit bulls--he had one himself--but his dog has been mauled twice at two different kennels by pit bulls, and bitten badly enough to go to the vet a third time. He understandably has some anxiety about it happening again and losing his dog, and is beyond worked up about it. I'm trying to keep his blood pressure down by finding a daycare/kennel that doesn't allow them so he can visit his dad without having a heart attack.

It seems like Camp Bow Wow used to not allow them, but they do now. So that's out. We've looked at all kinds of different boarding kennels, but none of them seem to say anything about this on their websites. I'm going to start calling around today, but was hoping someone here had a lead because the two I've called so far got pissed when I asked them about it.

Long story short right before covid broke my family was horribly sick. It lasted a month, kids and husband were fine after but I began getting issues more and more on top of the other (lymph nodes swelling for no reason, getting faint when I stand or get up from laying down, feeling like I have a flu half the day then fine, and way too many more) and it’s just been getting worse. Some days barely anything bothers me, other days simple tasks run me down to exhaustion.

I went to my doctor, she thinks it’s either long haul Covid (that we had it right before we knew it was here) or possibly MS. Said “find a neurologist” and handed me a paper saying it was a referral. She’s a good doctor but unfortunately it’s common they don’t name someone to go to. So Seattle Reddit, any advice? I can’t keep going like this and need some clarity on what’s wrong with me.

A hotel might be an option, but seems risky due to number of visitors and the virus being so prevalent.

There's been a lot of rage and anger towards the new restrictions, particularly because of the upcoming holidays. There's a lot of blame and finger pointing, particularly to out-of-staters. I haven't seen much data supporting these claims. However, I did see multiple groups of hunters this weekend (all Vermont license plates) arrive in separate trucks, not wearing masks, and not socially distanced. Notably absent from my observations were any good examples of hunters doing their part to stop the spread. (Solo hunting, masks, single household hunts). 

If we locals can't do what it takes to stop this virus, please stop attacking others. When we don't follow the rules, we not only endanger our long-time neighbors, but we also endanger out-of-staters who have chosen here to spend money during quarantine.

Ed Singer’s mobile phone rang at 2 a.m.

Pleasant View Nursing Home was running out of oxygen, a hospital official told Singer, the health officer of rural Carroll County, Md. Without 16 additional tanks, some of the most fragile [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&itid=lk_inline_manual_3) patients might not make it through the night.

The day before, 66 of the 95 residents of the nursing home in Mt. Airy, Md., had tested positive for covid-19. One, a man in his 90s, died in his bed. By morning, another resident would be gone.

The nursing home’s medical director was nowhere to be found, according to two government officials, who said the doctor later explained he was self-quarantining because he believed he had been exposed to the virus. Nurses with limited supplies and little supervision were struggling to treat rapidly deteriorating patients. Singer had spent hours the previous day searching for backup, to no avail. A paramedic who responded to a 911 call found the halls eerily quiet, with staff members masked and not talking, and ragged coughing audible from behind closed doors."|Maryland|2020|True|0

"[From e-mail from Del. Alonzo Washington.]

As you may know, the COVID-19 disease (commonly referred to as the Coronavirus) has arrived in Maryland. I want to assure you that our local, County, and State officials are taking this situation very seriously, and have taken steps to limit the outbreak of the disease.

So far, three Prince George’s County residents have tested positive for COVID-19. The Maryland Health Department has reported 94 negative COVID-19 tests and 9 positive tests throughout the state. 

Our School System

The Prince George’s County Public School System will continue to listen to the guidance and recommendations of the County and State Health Department. The school system encourages students to stay home if they are sick and will no longer require a physician’s note for an absence of 3 days or more, however a parent's note is still required.

Today, PGCPS was notified that an individual affiliated with Eleanor Roosevelt High School and College Park Academy had close contact with someone who traveled to a country under a high-risk COVID-19 warning. As a precaution, both schools will be closed Thursday, March 12 and Friday, March 13. PGCPS will utilize guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to sanitize each school during this closure. Students and staff will return Monday, March 16.

PGCPS is holding a telephone town hall on Thursday, March 12 from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. with CEO Dr. Monica Goldson, County Health Officer Dr. Ernest Carter, and Dr. George Askew, County Deputy Chief Administrative Officer for Health, Human Services, and Education. All you need to do is call 855-756-7520 ext. 56844#, and follow the prompts to be connected.

For more information, and to keep up to date on the steps our school system is taking in response to the virus, check out the PGCPS COVID-19 webpage.

State Efforts

This week, The General Assembly & Governor approved emergency legislation in response to COVID-19. This $50 million package will allow the Governor to utilize resources to fight the spread of the virus. You can read the Governor’s full press release about COVID-19 here.

Speaker Adrienne Jones has also introduced emergency legislation to protect Maryland residents. Her bill helps prevent price gouging, cost sharing, employee firing & allows for other preventative measures to ensure the health & security of all Marylanders. You can the read the full piece of legislation here.

Healthy Precautions

The Maryland Department of Health recommends taking these precautions to help prevent the spread of the disease:

Wash your hands frequently with soap & water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
Cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing
Avoid close contact with people who are sick
If you are sick, stay home from work or school
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and
Practice good health habits.
Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call the Prince George’s County Health Department Coronavirus Hotline at (301) 883-6627 to receive updated information about the disease. The Maryland Department of Health Website also contains helpful information.

I will be sure to keep you updated about further developments.

"Hello,

I’m moving to Canberra from Melbourne for APS grad program from February. 

First, I’m wondering if I’ve covered all the methods sufficiently on finding a house. I’m using Domain, Real Estate, Allhomes (I read that they have a partnership with YWCA’s affordable rentals program thing which I’d be eligible for). Facebook marketplace and Gumtree (both of these are no less expensive than the legit real estate websites it seems). And I’m monitoring two big (active) Canberra share housing facebook groups, though I would like to not be in a sharehouse. Is there any avenues I’m missing? I’m keeping up with all of these but my time is coming up soon, I’ll have the three weeks of hotel time from start of Feb to inspect places but if one looked right beforehand from the listing I’d take it with no inspection

I’m wanting to have my own place, happy to be reasonably far from the city to reduce rent, despite working in the middle of the city. Sharehousing is what I’m used to, but I’m a bit sick of it, and I think it would be worse for me in Canberra, where I’m not clued in to the social scene where I could perhaps find a musician-friendly kind of house.

Yes a major consideration is that I’m a hobbyist musician and I’d like to be able to be pretty unrestricted in my making of noise in the evenings and weekends, my only free time. I would like to do this in the most considerate way possible - I have tried being a drummer in an apartment before and despite being quite a quiet and jazzy type of drummer (think brushes/mallet not sticks) I was rather hated, I’d like to not repeat that. 

So I am keeping a special eye out for granny
flats, ones that are detached especially so I can be as small a nuisance possible. But I’m also a bit picky, I want a lounge that is not carpet, and I want high ceilings. I hope I could be upfront about this drumming thing without completely shooting myself in the foot in any application process. 

I’m trying to keep rent to a max of 400/wk in a place that’s my own, in trying to be a 30% figure of my entry level APS wage. Really 350/wk would feel better. Boy housing is expensive. I would also consider maybe a semi-rural property so that I can really have a lot of space, sonically and otherwise, but I haven’t seen much that I could feasibly get to work each day from. 

Any thoughts, perspectives, sledgings that anyone would like to give me? I know it’s a kind of rambling post"|canberra|2023|True|0

I've just moved to Canberra in the new year and have a severe undiagnosed medical issue that makes me sick all the time. I'm originally from Melbourne, where I consulted numerous doctors to find an answer and tried various treatment plans (none have worked). Now that I've relocated to Canberra, I need to start this discovery process anew. I tried visiting my GP and explained my problems and medical history, but, as usual, I was told there was nothing they could do, and they didn't even know whom to recommend.

"Part recommendation, part question! 

I was seeing the same GP for about 6 years, he was nice enough but so hard to get an appointment with, he ALWAYS ran late, and didn't consistently follow up on things, but it wasn't too expensive to see him and it was nice to have ""my"" GP. Fast forward to the week before Christmas, I got really sick but my GP was closed over the break so I just went to whatever was open near me. I ended up seeing Dr Ken Lee at Next Practice clinic in Braddon and wow was it a refreshing experience! For starters the clinic itself is so nice! I thought I'd accidentally walked into a spa! The front desk staff are so friendly, a real change from the usual snappy greeting I'd gotten used to. And the doctor ran on time! He was so lovely and attentive that by the end of the appointment I asked for the form to transfer my records to his practice. As I was waiting to pay I heard a lady telling the reception staff what I had been thinking, (it's not eavesdropping if she said it loud enough for the whole clinic to hear right?) she said that she'd been seeing the same GP for ten years and she always left appointments feeling frustrated but since she moved to Next Practice she left feeling encouraged. 

It got me thinking about how many people I know who either don't really like their GP or don't even have a regular one, and it made me wonder (finally getting to the question part here), what makes you stick with a GP? Especially if they're not great! And any GP recommendations you may have! I'm happy with Dr Ken but you can't all start seeing him so gotta leave some suggestions for everyone else"|canberra|2023|True|0

"The affordable housing market in Sydney is fucked. That's not news. And being a renter sucks; also not news. But I had this strange moment today when I got to the checkout of an online store with a new cat tree and cat bed in my cart. The tree itself is 180cm tall. So not easy to take with me in a move and potentially may not fit in a new apartment if it were to be smaller than the one I live in now. So I had this hour long debate of whether I should or shouldn't buy these things. On one hand it provides valuable enrichment for my cat child but on the other, who knows where I'll be at the end of my lease?

Maybe the landlord will kick me out in hopes to up his rent. Maybe I'll get to stay and have a sigh of relief that I won't need to sell any furniture I can't take with me. Hell, I was even hesitant to buy a washing machine because I know a lot of affordable apartments in Sydney don't have internal laundry. So it would be a sunk cost for me and a headache to own if in the future if I would need to get rid of it.

I hate having this debate with myself. If I even deserve large furniture or if my cat deserves a new cat tree just because I'm a renter and will be one for the foreseeable 5 years. It makes every ""home"" feel temporary. Is it worth hanging up this painting a friend gave me, if down the line I'll have to patch a hole in the wall? And if the landlord doesn't like the fix-up job I did, there goes my bond.

Moving in for the first time from my parent's home was easy and cheap. I had nothing besides my bed, an armchair, and my clothes. Everything else was slowly accumulated. And now the big ass fridge I was gifted, the dishwasher, the beloved couches I own, even this beautiful vintage coffee table I have all feel so temporary. So moving again is going to be much, much more expensive now that I have actual furniture to haul around. I know I'm not the first one to feel like this; like putting up curtains, to make the landlord white walls feel more homey, is an ultimately futile effort.

How do all you fellow renters in Sydney get over the anxiety of having more stuff? How do you balance making a temporary place feel like a home without feeling bogged down by things you know you'll have to move one day?

Edit: Obligatory I did not expect to get as many comments as this post did. Thank you to all of those who encouraged me to try not get stuck in the worrying about the future mentally. I did end up getting the cat tree! I guess I was more intending to discuss the unfortunate renter mentality we're often forced into. Since no home ever feels like ""home"". Which is unfair and largely due to how loosey goosey landlords are with renting laws.  
 And also how hard it is to fight unfair evictions and the like due to just how long it takes for your case to get attended to and also the harassment from REA and landlords. It's been said but I'll say it again, Sydney desperately needs a huge overall in renter's laws and the housing market to actually serve the people. Renting as a concept isn't a bad thing but the way its being played out in reality now is affecting all of our mental health and it's just not fair. "|sydney|2022|True|0
Anyone else had this? Is this normal? I have never had a flu this bad for this long. Taken three RATs, all negative. Initially I had fatigue, headache, dry cough, blocked nose and fever. The last 4 days it’s been an inflamed/blocked ear, blocked nose, laryngitis and bad chesty cough and my throat hurts to talk, swallow and sometimes breathe.

"Hi everyone, I'm a foreigner in Sydney - I'll be here till October. Unfortunately, due to last minute flight plans, I couldn't arrange to bring specific medications from my country.

I went to a GP today and he advised me that I will definitely need to get the psychiatrist to write up a prescription for me and he doesn't have the power to write it up for me. Unfortunately, I'm completely out of my medications (I take high doses everyday too)I get terrible headaches without them as well as just an inability to be productive.

All the psychiatrists I call have a wait time of over 4+ weeks. Is there any psychiatrist that gives immediate consultations here in Sydney? I don't mind having to drive a distance to get it either.

"I have had two jobs in Maryland since moving here from New York. In New York, the rules are nice and clear - if you live together and have assets together, you are in a domestic partnership and get protections, automatically, easy peasy. 



Here? Well...

  
The first job was HJF, a defense contractor. They did not respect domestic partnerships. My partner was in the hospital. I took a sick day. My time card was rejected because sick PTO could only be used for me or someone in my family. My partner was not considered family. I had to use vacation PTO.

The second job is GAP Solutions for NIH. They seem to be a little more flexible, but we had to sign their own little contract and play by some weird rules like the differences between a beneficiary and a recipient and other things for insurance reasons. I think they have to do that because Maryland does not explicitly recognize (or protect) domestic partnerships the way that New York does.

  
Does your employer recognize your partnership?

"Hey all.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to see more and more mumps posts on here, so I wanted to make a post where I can easily find and answer any questions you have about the outbreak on Temple's campus.

&#x200B;

Here's some basic info:

*What is mumps?*

Mumps is a disease caused by a virus. People who have mumps can have swollen and sore cheeks and jaw, fever, headache, muscle aches, feel tired or lose their appetite. Most people feel better in a week or two. Some people with mumps may not even know that they have the disease. Mumps can occasionally cause serious health problems, especially in adults, like swelling of the brain or deafness. Some boys and men may develop swelling of the testicles.

*How does mumps spread?*

Mumps can be spread when someone who has mumps coughs, sneezes, or sprays saliva on someone else or an object that others touch. You can also get mumps from sharing utensils or cups with someone who has mumps. People who have the mumps can spread it to others two days before and up to five days after they start feeling sick. If you feel sick, stay away from other people!

*What should students do if they think they have mumps?*

If you feel sick with fever, headache, or have a sore jaw or swollen cheeks, you should stay home and away from other people. Staying away for five days will help keep other people from getting sick. If you still feel sick or your symptoms get worse, contact student health or your doctor.

&#x200B;

Edit: in no way thinking people should go about their days as normal if they are sick, stay home and get better. But yeah if you feel like something is coming or getting over the end of it, a mask should be worn. Hopefully the stigma around mask wearing is gone. You are being responsible.

"UPDATE: Ok so he has already been through a view of the services that you guys have mentioned, such as the Haven Home Safe and some others. They've all let him stay for a couple of weeks then asked him to pay $100 a week, which he can't afford bc he has had problems accessing centrelink due to COVID and no phone. I'm paying to get him into a home for the next week while we figure out what to do next, so we're ok for the time being.

I've spoken to my Aunty who works in an organisation that provides healthcare to the homeless. They have him in the system, but since he has been discharged from hospital they've had problems getting in contact with him as he has no phone.

I'll be collecting a phone for him soon thanks to u/lerder and from there my Aunty shall get him in contact with some people to see what can be done so that he doesn't keep getting hand-balled around.

I'm still unsure exactly what his health condition is, and which one of us is confused about it, so sorry about that. He mentioned something called SSC when I spoke to him today, but I have no clue what that is.

Anyway, thanks to everyone who has reached out, I really appreciate it, and hopefully we're making some progress.

Hey Melbourne reddit fam, I could really use your help.

There's this really lovely guy who is homeless who lives under a bridge near me (Northcote).

He wasn't at his usual spot for about a month, so when he returned I asked him where he'd been, and without divulging too much of his personal info over reddit, he has necrotizing fasciitis which is eating his foot. To make things worse he's already lost an arm.

I feel so terrible for this guy. He's so gentle and kind, but he lives such a lonely life. I think about him every night when I'm lying in bed with my partner, knowing that he's curled up under a bridge by himself.

Can you guys imagine how depressing it would be not having anyone in the world to care for you? It must be so alienating and crushingly lonely to walk the streets and see people communing and thinking that people will never relate to you in that way.

I feel so proud to live in such a fucking incredible and progressive city, but I feel so sad that there's this whole group of people that we've left behind for no good reason. How can we be one of the most liveable cities in the world when there are sick people squatting alone under bridges?

My Aunty is a nurse who works with homeless people so I'll be talking to him today and seeing if he has some sort of advocate and then chatting to her, so I think I don't really need help on that front. I don't quite know what I'm asking for from you guys, but if there's anything you can do to help, please let me know.

I've taken him a bit of stuff to make his life a bit easier, but none of it is going to help him create a better life for himself. If you guys have any ideas how I could help him stimulate change in his life, for instance by getting a job, please let me know. One thing he does need is a phone, as he said he'd love to be able to watch stuff at night, because he just has a radio at the moment. So if there's anyone within 5km of Northcote who has a phone that he could have please let me know and I can come pick it up!

Thanks so much guys, and sorry for the long post.

We then called in an environmental contractor to check for mold and when he ran his meter he was picking up elevated formaldehyde and TVOCs. Since we had no new cheap furniture or anything like that that would off gas and he wasn’t picking it up outside, he urged us to call Xcel again and make them check after telling them another company has picked up gas. 

A friend recommended instead calling the duty chief at our fire dept and politely asking if they would be willing to come out with a multi gas detector since they like the opportunity to give new folks training in it.

"My girlfriend has a condition known as CFS, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - and since moving to Denver with me, she has had a hell of a time finding a good doctor to help her with this condition. 

Primarily, her previous doctors have used ADD-related meds to help with her symptoms - however, every doctor she has gone to here has tried cutting her prescriptions by over half, sometimes as low as a quarter of what she was previously prescribed. She has little choice but to accept whatever she can get, as she can barely function day-to-day without such meds, but the lower prescriptions are making it incredibly hard for her to make it through each day while honoring the prescription she's given - leading to many days where she has to take an extra - leading to many days where she has no medicine at all, waiting for her refills. 

It's a vicious cycle, and she barely has the energy to even find new doctors at this point.

I hope this isn't against any rules - we aren't looking for the drugs themselves - but does anyone have experience with doctors and this condition in Denver - any recommendations for a doctor that will respect her needs?

"I got sick from LC a couple years ago and a lot of stuff with that. I have a friend who travelled a lot and kept saying they felt sick every time they came back to Denver. Like just felt like crud when they woke up everyday. They finally moved away and said the weird symptoms stopped.  

I recently returned from a 9 day international trip and noticed some stuff. For one I’ve dealt with skin and scalp dryness and flakiness which is expected with the dryness here. I could definitely tell I looked a lot younger and vibrant skin wise. And a red face rash and low grade fever i would get every day stopped. 

I’m back to waking up foggy and having worse cognitive sharpness since being back and my abide reflux is starting to flare up again. I’m not saying it’s 100% from being back in Denver but it’s just something that got me thinking. 

I found out a few months ago that my blood is thicker than it should be due to more red blood cells so I wonder if the altitude is affecting that or if there’s something in my rental that I’m having exposure to that’s causing reactions in my skin, GI, and neuro systems"|Denver|2023|True|0
Shot #1 mainly activates antibodies, which last about 6 months. Shot #2 is what pisses off the immune system into producing tons of T- and Memory B-Cells, which last years. The fever and discomfort is the factory firing up to create that army. It's a good thing. Get shot #2.|Utah|2021|True|0
"Just a quick note that the service, which many of us have relied on for safe outdoor rapid pcr testing is ending this month. 

Alternatives: obviously you can always use rapid antigen tests (RAT or lateral flow tests) that you buy at the pharmacy. Just remember, while a positive is always reliable, a negative on these tests is not until day 6. That's why PCRs are considered better tests. 

You can still get a PCR through the county, urgent care, your physician, and other testing centers. PCRs usually take a day or two to get back. Some urgent care centers do have the rapid PCR, which takes a few hours. 

The reason rapid PCRs are essential is for people who need paxlovid prescriptions, since it can only be prescribed in the first 5 days of symptoms (and a rapid test might not be positive in those first 5 days). 

Again, some urgent cares offer them. Also, two companies produce at home rapid PCR tests: Cue Health and Lucira. Lucria's rapid PCR tests are currently on sale for $30 a pop. If you are immunocompromised or going to be around someone who is (grandparents?) then its a great investment, and remember, insurance will reimburse you for $12 per test, up to 8 tests a month. (except for medicare, which blows). You can submit your receipts for reimbursement."|Portland|2022|True|0

"Anybody else noticing that all our utilities have gone through the roof?  Started around Covid with Dominion Energy charging almost double for our standard DTH (decatherm) where it used to be around $7.8 to 8.5 on average then went to $13.5 with Dominion claiming the price of natural gas was expensive, but we had like a 1 month spike then it leveled off to a 20+ year low, however the prices never returned until they sold off to now Enbridge when prices immediately went down to like $8.1, currently sitting at $9.3.  

Don't get me started on Rocky Mountain Power's plan to increase by 30% in the next 2 years then finally our water bills have this new Rate Stabilization Fee.  The kicker here is their excuse as to why we have the fee.  ""Water and sewer rate stabilization fees were implemented to incorporate revenue reliability for SLCDPU during fiscal year 2025 (FY2025), after multiple years of decreased revenue due to reductions in water use and other factors.""  Now they state it's not intended to be a long term solution while they finish some study, but just finish the study, not at the expense of us that chose to conserve water.  Hell with conserving anything if we just get punished for it.  

I'm sure, myself and others are sick and tired of having no representation as I've emailed our governor and congressmen multiple times only to get an auto response of thank you for your inquiry.

"I really just need to proceed with a divorce, but my ex wants me to wait for him to finish school (cosmetology licensing) in another state before I even file for legal separation because he “doesn’t want to be stressed out while he’s studying and focusing on his mental health” and he doesn’t want to have to pay child support “because I know he can’t work right now when he’s in school!”

So, currently, I am effectively raising my kids on a single income with 100% of the time while the law still sees us as married. And I’m sick of having to wait for his ideal timing just to avoid making him mad.

What I am looking for: a lawyer (preferably Utah county, I’m in Provo) with lower pricing or lower income deals (I currently qualify for Medicaid).

I also have questions for anyone who might have answers:

1) my soon-to-be-ex-husband  (STBXH) insists that it is better for me to not file for separation since I currently qualify for more benefits with him counted as part of the household. Others have told me I will qualify for more as a single mom and to not listen to him. Who is correct? (For the record, I am not trying to stay on gov benefits long term, but I’m a junior in my role right now with 3 kids, and my ex doesn’t even work, so the only way I can get medical and childcare is with benefits right now. I am trying to move up and out of that bracket…. But that’s harder when I don’t have the childcare 🤷‍♀️)

2) can I get a separation and a divorce and include in the contract that he doesn’t have to pay child support until a certain time and will shared custody at that time as well?

3) why resources are there lower income divorce filings?

4) what did you include or wish you had included in custody agreements?

"You will be receiving an email from PPS with a link to a survey about students returning to the classroom in a hybrid model. I ask you to PLEASE wait before filling this out until closer to the deadline of Feb. 22 in order to give yourself enough time to envision what this will actually look & feel like for your student. You may also want to listen to teachers’ perspectives on what this will be like for your student and yourself.

I believe the model and examples PPS have given you are perhaps not realistic and/or well  thought out while neglecting input from the people actually delivering this service. Teachers are receiving this information at the same time as you, and quite frankly, some are hesitant to say that this will actually be a benefit for your student/family.

Reasons:

1.Direct instructional time for students in my class will be reduced from what they are currently receiving in CDL (Comprehensive Distance Learning) by *45 mins per day*.

2. Students in class will be doing the same lessons as students at home. This means that students in class will just be working on a chromebook at their desk, as opposed to a chromebook at home where they can be isolated from the virus. This seems pointless to me.

3. “Socialization” and “social opportunities” will be severely limited due to in-class and school-wide requirements of a 6 ft. social distancing radius at all times. There will be no small group work or “recess time” at school. There will be no assemblies or field trips. There will be no meals together.

4.Students will be required to wear a mask at all times - waiting for the bus, during the bus ride, all day in class, and during the return trip home. If your student has difficulty wearing a mask for extended hours, please consider staying with CDL.

5. Along with less direct instructional time, there will be less “practicing of skills” in class. That will become homework. Homework cannot be supervised by teachers, but must be supervised and tutored by you. This potentially means MORE responsibilities for caregivers to ensure students are practicing their skills and “staying on task”.

6. Let’s not forget the obvious; the CDC states, “Children, like adults, who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms (“asymptomatic”) **can still spread the virus to others**. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. However, some children can get severely ill from COVID-19.” Students can bring the virus home from school. There are also more easily transmissible variants rapidly spreading in the US from the UK and S. Africa. Would a return to school be wise at this time?

While a return to in-class instruction will benefit a few students, I believe this can best be achieved for those students through the Limited In-Person Instruction (LIPI) model the district is currently implementing. Those students who need it most will continue to be able to access this.  A return to the classroom with a hybrid model for all students will be a complete disruption for those students who have settled into a nice groove and are making solid academic gains within our current at-home model.

If students return for the last quarter, it will realistically take 2-3 weeks for EVERYONE (students, teachers, and caregivers) to settle in and adjust to completely new routines. This leaves about a month of the hybrid model before school is out for summer. Do we really want to make this disruption to our current model for a month of possibly lower quality instruction? Do you have a clear picture of what your student’s daily routine will be from the information in the letter from the district? I don’t. Why reinvent the wheel so late in the year?

This is why I urge you to wait until closer to Feb 22 to fill out this survey, so that you may be certain of your opinion on whether this change will actually be beneficial for you and your student. Let’s please wait for more clarification and discussion about the consequences of switching to a hybrid model to close out the year. The opinions expressed here are solely my own and do not represent the official position of school administrations or Portland Public Schools.

Thank you for your consideration.

TLDR; Wait to fill out the survey until thoroughly thinking through what hybrid learning will be like for your student and talk to teachers about what they think it will be like."|Portland|2021|True|0

"Hey guys. I posted about my “breakdown” in March 2020.  After that terrible day, I have constantly tried to be optimistic and kind. It’s been a struggle, to say the least.

I had another breakdown on Saturday. Nothing specific happened that day to make me crumble into a useless pile of meat, as it had been building all year. I called dispatch to ask if they could let me go early that night.  I was just done. I ended up having to call in “sick” to get relieved. When I got to my car, I took my mask off and gasped for air as I sobbed loud sobs of grief and rage and sadness and frustration. Just writing these words now makes me cry all over again. [And just proof reading this makes me cry again!]

I’m used to being able to put my finger on the one thing that has caused me to be upset. I am unable to do that now. It’s just......it’s so fucking hard to go out into the world every day.  

I have felt an anger and rage towards everyone—even the nice, unassuming folks that get on my bus and say “good morning”. This is a new feeling for me and I’ve realized how self-centric rage and anger is. If someone ever took the chance to call me out on my shortness, my response would probably start with “YOU DON’T KNOW HOW IT IS FOR ME....”. The thing is that yes, they indeed know how it is. They are just mustering up their own optimism to say “good morning” to a stranger as they are also grieving what we once had. 

I hate myself for this. I am saddened by the fact that I am no longer able to handle this job, as it is not the same job that I signed up for. I came home on Saturday and, in an attempt to re-center myself, read all of my first entries when I became a bus operator (“first six months”). Those six months I wrote down everything of importance—logged all of the exceptionally bad things that happened and recorded all of the fun, random acts of humanity. I realized at that moment that all of the bad things that happened in those six months could fit into about two weeks for me now, and all of the good things are absent.

As I’ve mentioned before, my little sister is an ICU nurse in Texas. Currently they are all out of beds and she is tasked with up to four patients a day. A normal day would only be one or two patients per nurse in the ICU. The hospital has allowed them to chart less to allow time for all of their tasks. When she calls me on her way home from work her stories are all about people that she hoped to help but are dead now. People who are brain dead and whose family is unable to let them go just yet. People who she thought had a chance, but whose body she just washed for the last time. She has watched as COVID has gone through a healthy young man’s body and torn their lungs to shreds. The virus will be gone by the time they die. There is nothing she can do. There is nothing she can learn from for the next patient. This is her life, and I worry about my baby sis every day. When I ask her about how she’s able to keep herself together through this and care for her family in the meantime, she attributes her strength to her coworkers. She has an amazing team of folks that she has worked with for years. They are able to debrief together and support one another on the tough days—every day now, as it seems. 

I am not watching people die and witnessing those last moments with a loved one, thank goodness, but I am witnessing and experiencing the desperation of our town—by myself. I don’t have a team that I can go to when I need. Most days now I feel like I am driving a mobile psych ward around and I am the only (untrained) staff member there to keep everyone safe. I don’t have people to unload on when I need to. I don’t have a walk-in cooler to go and scream in for a moment (boy, do I kinda wish I was an out of work bartender right now). I don’t have a person whose cubicle I can walk over to and say, “Hey, so this guy has been yelling at the top of his lungs and slamming his foot onto the floor so hard that I can feel it. How would you approach this?  I don’t want to escalate this situation and I’m worried that anything I do may cause that.”  

So yeah. I feel alone and I feel like I’m a psych nurse driving a mobile hospital around town with zero resources right now. I’m at a complete loss. I’ve been crying on my days off and I’ve been trying not to cry every moment that I am at work. 

There is a FB page that is for transit operators around the world and I posted a thing asking how others are dealing with this challenge right now. I got a mix of folks who feel the same way I do and others who have told me to “not give a fuck and just drive”.  If you’ve had a chance to read any of my last posts, you would be safe to assume that I can’t “not give a fuck”.  I believe the qualities that make me a good public servant are the same qualities that make this job extra hard for me right now. I’m struggling to find a balance. I wish I could just not care, but if I didn’t care I wouldn’t be able to allow myself to be open to those random moments of awesomeness with strangers, which is what makes this job worthwhile. 

I’m on my 5th therapist in my adult life and I can say that she is THE ONE, I hope. I’ve told her all about my struggles at work and I also told her that I sometimes write about the job (used to) as a way to process that shit. Now it just feels like I’m writing a tragedy every day as I watch our city suffer.  She suggested that I continue to write, even about the bad things, but change the ending. Her suggestion was to write about what David Rose (or any other character) would do in my situation.  She also prescribed me to watch an episode of Schitt’s Creek every day after work (she saw my face light up on Zoom when I mentioned that show). I really like this gal. So this week I will try my hand at fan fiction—something that l have never felt a calling for and I may be really terrible at, but may allow me an escape from the reality that has become my job/life. I’m doing my very best here to survive. 

I’ve also made an appointment with my doctor next week to talk about stress leave—it’s been a long time coming. 

What are you all doing to get through this?  How many of you feel like you’re the unsung heroes of this pandemic?  I have a feeling that most of us are Captains of the Crazy, just waiting for the storm to subside. How do we survive this with our humanity in tact?

Much love,

I'm curious what folks' threshold is. It seems like everyone has different levels of risk management (some people would immediately dine indoors when that becomes available, for example, while others haven't left their house for anything other than groceries since March) Let's say the virus keeps mutating or the vaccine doesn't work out as planned and we need a Plan B. Or there is another, similar virus that enters the stage. How much longer could you take this? 6 months? A year? Five? At what point does it cross the threshold where the societal costs of depression, isolation, Portland's economic collapse, and simply not living outweigh the risks of the disease for you?|Portland|2021|True|0

"So, have I got a live one for you ladies and gents.  

This happened to my husband just now.  We live in Maine, but we are currently in Washington state doing travel work in healthcare.  Now, full disclosure, we are from away.  I am a born and bred Montanan, but we have lived in Maine for almost 3 years.   Maine is our home and it's where we plan on living the rest of our lives. 

My husband went to get his Rx filled at the pharmacy and proceeded to have a 30-minute argument with the pharmacy tech.  My husband's point of view was that Maine is a state in the United States of America.  The tech disagreed, because Maine isn't in their system and insisted that he is sure it's not in the U.S. anyway.  They go back and forth and the tech recruits' reinforcements, and this guy says it's not a state at all it's a region of....  (God help me) Massachusetts.  

Eventually, they get it settled after bringing in a 3rd person who confirmed that yes, Maine is in The United States of America, it is, in fact its own state, and it absolutely is not part of Massachusetts.

"[From e-mail from Del. Alonzo Washington.]

As you may know, the COVID-19 disease (commonly referred to as the Coronavirus) has arrived in Maryland. I want to assure you that our local, County, and State officials are taking this situation very seriously, and have taken steps to limit the outbreak of the disease.

So far, three Prince George’s County residents have tested positive for COVID-19. The Maryland Health Department has reported 94 negative COVID-19 tests and 9 positive tests throughout the state. 

Our School System

The Prince George’s County Public School System will continue to listen to the guidance and recommendations of the County and State Health Department. The school system encourages students to stay home if they are sick and will no longer require a physician’s note for an absence of 3 days or more, however a parent's note is still required.

Today, PGCPS was notified that an individual affiliated with Eleanor Roosevelt High School and College Park Academy had close contact with someone who traveled to a country under a high-risk COVID-19 warning. As a precaution, both schools will be closed Thursday, March 12 and Friday, March 13. PGCPS will utilize guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to sanitize each school during this closure. Students and staff will return Monday, March 16.

PGCPS is holding a telephone town hall on Thursday, March 12 from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. with CEO Dr. Monica Goldson, County Health Officer Dr. Ernest Carter, and Dr. George Askew, County Deputy Chief Administrative Officer for Health, Human Services, and Education. All you need to do is call 855-756-7520 ext. 56844#, and follow the prompts to be connected.

For more information, and to keep up to date on the steps our school system is taking in response to the virus, check out the PGCPS COVID-19 webpage.

[Please visit www.pgcps.org/coronavirus for additional information and resources.]

State Efforts

This week, The General Assembly & Governor approved emergency legislation in response to COVID-19. This $50 million package will allow the Governor to utilize resources to fight the spread of the virus. You can read the Governor’s full press release about COVID-19 here.

Speaker Adrienne Jones has also introduced emergency legislation to protect Maryland residents. Her bill helps prevent price gouging, cost sharing, employee firing & allows for other preventative measures to ensure the health & security of all Marylanders. You can the read the full piece of legislation here.

Healthy Precautions

The Maryland Department of Health recommends taking these precautions to help prevent the spread of the disease:

Wash your hands frequently with soap & water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
Cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing
Avoid close contact with people who are sick
If you are sick, stay home from work or school
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and
Practice good health habits.
Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call the Prince George’s County Health Department Coronavirus Hotline at (301) 883-6627 to receive updated information about the disease. The Maryland Department of Health Website also contains helpful information.

I will be sure to keep you updated about further developments.

ATAR is bullshit. Yes, it's the best measure of your rank compared to the rest of Australia but the entire Year 11 and 12 system is an absolute joke. I finished 176th out of 178 students at an elite private school in Perth. For years, I had assumed that I too perhaps was just not suited to academia. Perhaps there was simply something wrong with my brain and I doubted whether I would ever have a non-manual-labour future. After finishing with an ATAR not good enough for TAFE, I ended up repeating year 12 at a great adult college and enrolling in a degree that would make my parents happy. A year later, I then enrolled in something I actually had an interest in, finished that, and have now commenced a Commonwealth-supported place for the Juris Doctor at a 'group of 8' university. Among my current peers, many of whom finished with 95+ ATAR's, none would guess I didn't even log on to check my first ATAR out of shame (I know it couldn't have been enough for TAFE though, given I received a 20 for my Physics mock and fell asleep in the Chemistry exam). I was amongst the lowest performing students that year, both in my school and nationwide. Looking back, there is so much pressure from family, friends, and peers to 'achieve' and outdo others, rather than just doing your best and learning for the sake of learning.

I hope some of you can relate to this thought process.

""I have to get a 99 ATAR. As long as I get an 86 in Maths, 91 in English.. etc. I CAN DO IT!""  
\*First assessment comes back and it's 75/100 (still great)\*  
""Okay, well I guess I can get 95, BUT NO LOWER!""  
\*After 3 months, instead of trying to improve gradually and stay positive, you lived in constant anxiety and ended up with average of 70 across board, still on track for a decent mark though.\*  
""What's even the point?...""\*End up with 50s and 60s for the rest of the year as you feel like a failure due to not immediately meeting the ridiculous standards set for you from society\*

To start, I'll go through all that is ridiculous about WACE or HSC or whatever it is called where you are, especially considering how radically different uni becomes.

1. Exam conditions. During my whole time at uni, I have NEVER had an exam more than 2 hours. ATAR exams are typically 3 hours each, and for WA at least, occur just a few weeks after another set of 3 hour exams. Considering your Mock's are worth, typically, 50%, your entire supposed future at 17 is based on 6 hours of exams that occur within 4-6 weeks of each other. This is even more crazy considering many university assessments are assignments, which allow you to go at your own pace - meaning you are on a level playing field against those that don't suffer from anxiety/have better attention spans. For example, English is a subject that it makes NO sense to have a three-hour, regimented exam for (bar potentially budgetary/marking efficiency reasons). I am an English major and had a final year GPA of 6.5, however, I just about failed WACE English as I found the 'closed-book', 3 hour conditions to be stressful and completely against the spirit of what English is supposed to be - creative expression. Furthermore, the obsession with 'INTRO, BP1, BP2, BP3, CONCLUSION' AND NOTHING ELSE is ridiculous. Why not offer a creative option? Or students being permitted to choose their own topic, submitted in advance? For my final year at Uni, one one class had an Exam and it was a 2 hour, 2 essay assessment which we just about knew the questions for before. At Uni you can consult weekly with your tutor and they are there to help you and ensure your success. At school, teachers are spread thin, you're in a class with 24 others and you receive about as much individual attention as a hotel convention room 'self-help' seminar (which, 17 year-olds, is not much, btw).
2. Relentlessness. School is fucking relentless. 5-6 periods a day, 5 days a week, whilst trying to balance some semblance of a social life and figuring out yourself and your changing body and new ideals. Learning that those that supposedly 'love' you and 'want the best' don't even know what they're fucking talking about half the time, and are often living their own failures vicariously through you. Yet, you still have to function within this unit due to being wholly reliant on them for food/shelter/transport/funds/love/care/support. In Europe, you don't finish school in many countries until 20, meaning your final years you can effectively live independently. Also, in Italy for example, at 15, you choose a particular 'school' you would like to attend for your last few years, trade, arts, science, design etc. meaning your peers share your interests and thus one teacher isn't trying to reach 6 different ideologies among 24 students.
3. Money. This is such a paradox. I had a friend whom migrated to Australia in Year 9. His family worked really hard, yet still struggled, and fell below a certain income, thus he was eligible for $250 a fortnight through Youth Allowance. How much did I get? $50 a fucking week which was held over me and withheld for any infraction. Some friends got maybe $70-$80 a week, but still this is far, far less than what disadvantaged youth get. This means many kids, in order to gain some sense of financial empowerment, take their partners out, and to not be the 'cheap cunt', have to take on a part-time job; meaning they are spread even more thin for time and study. Please note, this is not at all critical of the Centrelink system, and it's fantastic Australia provides a social, safety net. Just wanted to point out the lack of logic of growing up 'middle-class', being made to feel guilty for wanting a sense of financial security, and how, for youth at least, it can actually be a disadvantage to be 'middle-class' during High School and even until the Centrelink independence cut-off age of 22. That's right 22! Until 22 you are not considered 'independent' without jumping through some massive hoops and hurdles. Meaning if your parents give you $20 a week, and sometimes not even that should you not abide by their wishes, you can just about go and fuck yourself or get a job. Even then, many parents wont even allow or give you grief for getting a job too, ""as it's distracting"".

Fuck that noise. There is a rainbow after the relentlessness.

Uni is at a much more measured pace (for almost every non-science/medical degree at least), so if you didn't get the high ATAR mark you wanted, still got into uni, but are worried that ""I didn't do well at school, so I won't do well at uni."" DONT! Just do not for a second think that. If you want to succeed at uni, you will. Simple. There are typically only 3-4 assessments throughout the semester, with a 6 week break in-between, followed by a 12-week break at the end of the year. You can take a breath and do most of your assessments a few hours a day (recommend rather than spending 12 hours on an essay the day before). Almost all lectures are recorded, meaning you only have to actually go into class for literally 4-6 hours a week for many courses, making it much, much easier to balance work and a social life.Despite all the positives, uni is much less 'in your face' and thus it can be very, very easy to fall into a complacency trap. Here are some common ones:

* If you can, then please go to the lectures/non-compulsory classes as you will be better off. This is not because you can't catch up just as well at home, but it's very, very easy to take this newfound freedom for granted and then end up having to watch 36 lectures in 3 days at the end of the semester. My suggestion is that if you plan to watch them at home, set aside (as in write it down and stick to it!) 4 hours a week to watch each lecture in your own time at home. People say ""make it 2x speed for it to be over quicker"", I suggest the opposite. Rather, make each 0.75x speed and really try to absorb the info and take notes as the lecturer is speaking. You will barely notice a difference, it will only take 15 minutes more for a typical, 45 minute lecture, but it will be much less likely that you have to watch the lectures again to truly absorb them. This is my personal suggestion, however, please experiment with what works for you and Uni is about YOU now, so love yourself, your decisions, and your choices and make them for YOU and you'll be fine!
* Try not to miss ANY assessed classes. You typically can miss up to 3 without a big hit to your participation mark (which is usually 10-20% of your mark overall), however, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST this, especially very early on in semester. Here's why.  
Week 2: ""Damn, I'm really sleepy this morning. I know I missed the first week's class, but I can miss two more classes without missing out any marks. I just have to go to EVERY class from now on, and I will :). Cool. \*Hit's snooze button\*  
Next week: ""Fuck, why did I choose a 9am unit.. Alright, if I miss this, I can still get a good mark if I go to EVERY class from now on.""  
\*You attend every class for next 3 weeks\*  
Week 8: \*Your alarm doesn't go off\* \*You have a relationship/family emergency\* \*Work calls you in\* \*You have an opportunity/something that can ONLY be done now\* \*You are sick or actually tired\* \*You have a big assessment for another unit that you put off/forgot about (it's going to happen, don't say it wont) and you could use the time to finish it off\*  
If you are to miss this class and don't want the hassle of going to the doctor's for a medical certificate, then put yourself in a great position early on by attending all classes until at least week 7/8, especially if you're not going to lectures, then once you're a good deal into the semester you can treat yourself with a sleep in. Also, by attending as much as you can, especially early on and ACTIVELY participating, you maximize your chances to achieve a 100% participation mark. Someone that goes to all classes until week 8, then misses week 9/11, is much more likely to get a good mark than someone that comes in for the first time in week 4, has to introduce themselves, ""Hi, I'm Steve, sorry it's week 4, I was overseas/sick/derp"", even if they miss the same amount of classes.
* Get yourself into the best position you can for the final assessment/exam early on. By getting the max participation mark you can (put your hand up and say some shit, even if it's not right it show's you're interested and keen to learn) and also doing well in the earlier, generally easier assessments, you will need a much lower mark to pass/excel. There are sooo many instances I've seen of myself and others finishing on a 79 or 49, meaning just a few hours extra study or just one more class attended/one more question asked, would have meant the difference between an amazing mark and GPA booster, or 6 more months of your life repeating the same material again due to an F and a massively diminished chance of Post-Grad (it sucks).
* Withdrawing/Deferral culture: For some reason, a logical fallacy exists (I did it too) that withdrawing/getting a doctors note to withdraw/delay an exam/test, will make you do better. Even if you are worried about not excelling, please don't withdraw or put off anything. For my first few years, if I didn't think I could do well I would withdraw before the date that it would show up as a F (around 6 weeks in). This meant it kept my GPA and WAM intact, but I was still liable to pay for the unit. Same principle is going to the doctor's, complaining about a cough, deferring your exam, and getting 6 more weeks to study. Guess what? You've just fucked your holidays, wont get a proper break, probably wont study that hard as ""I have 6 weeks! :) "" and then will do your exam just a week before the semester, pass (probably would have anyways) and then go back to uni with no semblance of relaxation and feel more overwhelmed as a result. I thought I had 'cracked the system' by getting sick notes for my anxiety, but by delaying the ripped band-aid, you're just elongating the process and setting yourself up for eventual failure. This practice stems from a 'fear of failure' but as long as you're conscious and simply break down each unit into bite-sized chunks and 'do your best' you'll pass. Guaranteed. My worst experience was having a shit break due to delaying the exam, spending my holiday period thinking I had heaps of time and making pages of 'study plans' (without any study), only to get to exam day and feeling LESS prepared than during the semester. I ended up withdrawing on the day with another note from the doctor and wasting 6 weeks of my youth for NOTHING.
* Finally, please understand how GPA and WAM works, use it to do your best and keep track of it, but DON'T make it the core focus of your studies. Generally, a 0-49 is a 0, 50-59 is a 4, 60-69 is a 5, 70-79 is a 6, and 80+ is a 7. WMA is the weighted average of your marks, but as almost 99% of units are worth the same weighting (6 credit points in WA) then really it's just an average of your marks. Make your first priority to pass and try to do the best you can, as even 1 failure means a 0 for your GPA which will make incredibly difficult to do post-grad (but not impossible).

You'll do great and HS means NOTHING in the grand scheme of things. Someone I knew from school finished in the '99 club', did a double degree and excelled, Honours, finished his Master's last year, and yet is unemployed and doesn't know where to begin in terms of opportunities. Due to excess study in formative years, he has very little skills that employer's want or real-world experience, which (perhaps unfortunately), is what organizations are looking for. Your degree is the ticket, but YOU are the plane. Don't neglect friendships, fun, and experiences to study. You can have the best of all worlds whilst still being a high-performer, as long as you stay focused and efficient and do your best. Most importantly, please be honest with yourself. Don't set your expectations unrealistically high and feel dejected should you not meet them. Just know that if you do your best, you'll be your best.

I hope this has been helpful and please feel free to comment/PM if you have any further questions. Good luck and do not for a second regret your path as a teenager. Even if your ATAR wasn't good enough for Uni, there are many, many adult-training programs, some as quick as 6 months, that will get you there anyways - feel free to PM for advice."|darwin|2020|True|0
I had no choice but to go out and get my meds for my pulled tooth and a few softer food items till I'm healed up. There were at least 10 groups of teens with 3-6 in each group running around the store, buying makeup ect. or 4 teen girls to buy one loaf of bread and a pound of lunch meat. Even had one smart ass teen pretend to cough while him and his buddy were laughing and the 3 girls with them pretending to faint. I understand that the stay at home order sucks, school being cancelled may or may not suck but stay the FUCK home if your just going to go out in groups to Walmart to have fun and goof around.

"No idea how to link the photo, but an email went out today to members of the Oakland County Boat Club that said, in so many words, that someone who attended their St Patrick's Day party (on 3/14) has tested positive. A whole, ""we regret to inform you"", not any ""sorry we were irresponsible and held a huge party despite knowing about this virus."" 

Anyway, I figure it's a stretch but some of you may have gone or have friends/family who did. May want to let them know. 

There is also a confirmed case out of St. Benedict Catholic Church in Waterford. My extended family attends, they found out today. And half of their house is sick, days after having contact with the confirmed case (before they were confirmed, obviously.) 

When are people going to learn to stay home? And yes, I do mean my family as well. I've been trying to get them to listen to me for weeks, my parents thought it was a hoax. Now my mom is coughing for 10 hours straight, was at work all week until today, and is anti-doctor in general.

We've been sanitizing and cleaning constantly but can't keep up!

"It's terrible having people coughing and sneezing entering the store, touching things on the shelves, then placing them back down, plus standing close to each other in the checkout line. 

The risk can be substantially reduced if customers simply order online for pickup, then employees fetch for items themselves around the stores. Once gathered, the employees put it in a dropoff cart where the recipient needs to readoff their online receipt ID number from at least 10 feet away. The dropoff cart is rolled towards the customers. After the customer unload the items, they place it in the corrals. Shopping carts in the corrals are sprayed with disinfectants, then deep cleaned. Afterwards, the shopping carts are returned for reuse of employees. Rinse and repeat. Payment should be done online only  through the retailers or the mobile app. Cash is too risky.

I know it's not a silver bullet, but having tighter procedures will greatly slow down the spread."|Michigan|2020|True|0

"Out of all this time working at NYC311 as a representative, I’ve never experienced this amount of stress. We are backed up thousands of calls. THOUSANDS. Even during hurricane sandy it wasn’t like this!! It’s literally call after call after call NO breaks in between.. panicked people, screaming people, angry customer after angry customer... about the same thing.. coronavirus. If it’s not about the coronavirus it’s someone screaming for something else like a fucking illegally parked car. We as 311 operators still put our health at risk and come out, take public transportation just to get in the phone with these customers who yell at us because they’re on hold for 15 minutes like we’re not in a crisis. 

The news is the most relevant source of info right now. Our leaders are panicked themselves not knowing what to do to combat this virus besides shutting everything down. I don’t know what else customers want us to say. If the leaders are taken completely clueless, why do people expect us to know everything ?

It probably was a dumb assumption to assume that since more ppl are home, they’d just watch the news, catch up with the most updated info and not call 311 as much. I expected to get a lot of price gouging complaints or people who have no healthcare provider to call in and ask for help with this virus. But people are asking me if they have it.. if I can diagnose them.. angry at me because I can’t tell them the info they’re looking for because we haven’t received any updates.? People asking us to confirm misinformation/rumors.. This is the first time I’ve seen the city so chaotic!! 
 
At 311, a lot of my co workers are calling out every time they even see someone cough or show symptoms.. which makes it even more hectic for us because people are still going to call. I’ve called out too but I can’t use that much time. There’s still a whole year left. This is the first time I feel to stressed to go to work. I am literally hiding away from Monday. 

These city agencies are overworked and stressed, understaffed. There’s also city employees testing positive for COVID and we stillll have to go to work. I am shook. If you get a 311 agent that doesn’t have a good attitude please understand what we are going through !!  

We’ve been through 9/11.. Hurricane Sandy.. Swine flu.. Ebola..(which was much more dangerous and nothing got shut down to this extent) We’ve had worse and made it through worse but I’ve never seen the city this panicked..

"I keep seeing the President announcing that anyone who wants to get tested can get tested but besides that's, there's no information of how or where. I called 311 and was told NOT to go to an urgent care or emergency room, especially if I have no serious symptoms. The 311 rep told me that I would most likely not get tested if I was not showing any serious symptoms and that my best course of action was to stay home and self-quarantine.

They advised me to call the NYC Health and Hospitals for more information. Health and Hospitals has a pre-recorded voice message saying the same thing: that I will not get tested unless I'm showing serious symptoms and that I should just stay home. I mentioned all the celebrities that keep getting tested despite not having any symptoms and the rep told me that they are getting tested by private medical providers. I was advised to seek a private provider and get tested that way. The rep also tried to transfer me to THE on call doctor, who did not pick up the phone. He asked for my contact information and said the doctor would give me a call later (That was 4 days ago).

I followed the Health and Hospitals advise nonetheless and called my primary care provider (a private clinic in Manhattan). Guess what. They told me the exact same thing everyone else is telling me: not to go to the ER or urgent care, to just stay home and self-quarantine. 

I called an urgent care and a couple other private clinics and they all told me the exact same thing. 

I don't understand how all these celebrities and rich people keep getting tested while the rest of us are being left out to dry, and I don't understand why the government keep telling us that anyone who wants to get tested can get tested.

Hi everyone,

There’s been quite a bit of panic online lately about the novel coronavirus, Covid-19. And so, I wanted to make a thread dedicated to rational discussion and preparedness in wake of NYC’s increasing amount of confirmed cases, and the increasing social changes we are experiencing. The information in this article comes from the [WHO](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/joint-mission-press-conference-script-english-final.pdf?sfvrsn=51c90b9e_2) press conference on Feb 24, 2020, and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) website. As this situation is rapidly evolving, the numbers and information in this article are subject to change.

**Now, here are some facts about the virus.**


Covid-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a class of virus where four strains are known to cause mild illnesses in humans, such as a few forms of the common cold, and three strains are known to cause some very serious illnesses, such as SARS, MERS, and now Covid-19. 


Pathogens vary widely in effect depending on how they evolve. Diseases like SARS and MERS had very high mortality rates (~10% and ~30% respectively), but ended up petering out before wreaking global havoc. Why? SARS and MERS are not known to be contagious in incubation. And on top of that, they were most contagious after the easily-identifiable symptoms show up, which led to the ability for public health officials to rapidly identify patients, isolate them, and then isolate those they had contact with. Thus, the diseases were contained before spreading wildly. 


It appears that Covid-19 has a much longer incubation period (while it is typically 2-14 days before symptoms show up, it appears to be up to even 24 days in some cases), many mild cases that go under the radar or are misdiagnosed as a cold or flu, and even some asymptomatic cases. The virus is capable of spreading during incubation period, which means that people have no idea that they are even sick when they are going about their daily lives, potentially infecting others. 


Right now, the numbers in the news are about confirmed cases. Cases only get confirmed when a person presents with a severe enough case of the illness to warrant testing. And until recently, testing for the virus was not even offered in most cities and countries unless the person had confirmed contact with someone who was a suspected carrier or travelled to China recently. This has led to a number of cases that were only diagnosed after a patient had been in and out of hospitals for many days, without adequate preventive measures being used. 


This virus appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets (~6ft range from an infected person), but is likely to also spread in some capacity via aerosol (much longer range than 6ft) and fecal-to-oral contact (so wash your hands after using the bathroom!) 



* **How does this compare to the flu?**


In many cases, the virus initially presents similarly to influenza, symptom wise. It then often evolves into pneumonia, which can cause severe health consequences. Unlike the seasonal flu, there is no vaccine to prevent infection, and there is no known effective treatment for it (though some antiretroviral medications may show promise for treatment.) As of now, most treatment is geared around keeping the patient alive with supportive care while their body attempts to fight off the virus. And there is increasing evidence that people who were initially considered “cured” of COVID-19 may again test positive later.


**Influenza has an R0 value of 1.5-1.6, meaning that someone with the flu will likely infect around 1.5 people.** The R0 value of Covid-19 is still being established, as we don’t know how many cases there really are. Recent case numbers in Europe suggest that this virus has been spreading in the community for quite a while, undetected. And when there was a reason to test in the wake of the Lombardy outbreak, hundreds of new cases were suddenly identified. As it is, **the WHO estimates the R0 value of Covid-19 to be between 2.0-2.5,** making it more contagious than the flu. 


The flu has a relatively low mortality rate, in large part due to vaccinations and known effective treatments, such as tamiflu. Covid-19 does not have any known effective treatments or a vaccine yet, and it may be many months before one has finished development and trials. See the [CDC’s numbers](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) on the yearly burden of the flu. **Last season, the approximate mortality rate for the flu was approximately 0.1%. It is currently estimated that Covid-19 has a mortality rate of 3.4%** according to the latest announcement by the WHO, but this number varies widely depending on the healthcare system in the country of the outbreak, the age of the patient, etc. A person who is elderly with preexisting health conditions has a far higher risk of death than a young person with no preexisting conditions. For examples, diabetes, heart disease, and being over 60 are all things that significantly raise the risk of complications and death. And likewise, a person who is turned away from medical treatment due to overflowing hospitals (such as has happened in Wuhan) also has a higher likelihood of mortality. 


To conclude, while the symptoms of Covid-19 may present similarly to the flu, is is both more contagious and has a higher mortality rate than the flu. There is currently no vaccine and no particularly effective treatment. While the flu has currently killed more people than Covid-19, the flu has been spreading globally for a much longer season, whereas Covid-19 has only recently begun spreading outside of China, and at that, only first emerged in December. If nothing changes, we are likely to see significant increases in case numbers and fatalities from Covid-19 in the coming months. 


* **So, how can you prepare?**


The most important thing is to avoid panicking. Be logical with your purchases and your changes to plans. 

Especially in a city like NYC, one of the major concerns with a large-scale outbreak is disruption to the supply chain. If any significant percentage of the population is sick or quarantined, this impacts the ability of grocery stores to re-stock essential supplies in the short term. Even if the virus has 80% of cases being mild to moderate, those people would ideally stay home from work. And the 20% of people who end up in the hospital can also lead to a significant reduction in the workforce, not to mention cause a significant burden on the hospital systems. This may severely impact the amount of people available to keep a complex city infrastructure running. 


And in the event of an outbreak or an advised or mandatory quarantine, this often leads to chaotic scenes in grocery stores, where everyone tries to stock up at once and brawls may break out.


It would be wise to build a few month’s supply of essential nonperishable foods for your household when you are able to, the sooner the better. The sooner people prepare, it eases the burden on the system when things get very bad and supply chains get disrupted. Plus, it frees up resources (whether grocery items or even delivery services) for your neighbors who weren't able to prepare as well as you were. 


Cover the essential amino acids and vitamins in your diet to avoid malnutrition, and consider buying a supply of multivitamins to supplement with. Protein powders are a nonperishable way to meet your protein needs, and many staple foods, such as milk and eggs, come in shelf-stable or evaporated forms as well. Brown Rice and Lentils is a great way to meet your essential amino acid needs, and while boring, it will keep you alive on a budget. A sack of flour and a bag of yeast (or learning to make sourdough with flour and wild yeast!) is much wiser to buy than a loaf of bread at this point. Fresh fruits and vegetables may taste great, but if you’re going to stock up, dried fruits and vegetables are much wiser to get. As is meat jerky as opposed to fresh meat. 

While we obviously hope that things never get truly bad, consider that NYC is a very population-dense area, which relies on a lot of food imports from very far away.  If those supply chains get disrupted, everyone is better off if they have a significant store of food while things get reestablished. Some of the countries that supply our imports are already significantly affected (i.e. expect Parmesan shortages), and some countries have yet to see significant impact. But there's no telling what the world will be like in a few months, as more and more countries close their borders and shut down industry.


Make sure you also have an adequate supply of essential medications, from NSAIDs, cold/flu remedies, and Neosporin/bandages to your necessary prescriptions. With the fact that many of these items are manufactured in China (where factories have been closed for months now), we are likely going to see shortages in the coming months while the virus works its way around the world.


It’s also easy to overlook toiletries. You don’t want to be set for food, and run out of toilet paper, diapers, soap, sanitary products, or toothpaste a week into a city shutdown. But don't get into brawls over toilet paper, either. It's much wiser to just get a [bidet with a dryer function](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=bidet+with+dryer&crid=201KHDGITA0XW&sprefix=bidet+wit,aps,140&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9&linkCode=ll2&tag=altiora20-20&linkId=ecbf528ba5008fa887dab52dc8ed78d2&language=en_US) anyways (plus, it's cleaner and more environmentally friendly!) Seriously though, this toilet paper situation is ridiculous. 

And don’t forget your pets! Buy enough pet food and supplies to last, and make sure you have any pet medications covered as well. 

Keep in mind that manufactured equipment may also face shortages as well. Many items have parts that are made in China or other affected countries, from cars to strollers to medical equipment. If there is something that you know you will need to buy in the coming months, it may be wise to get it now instead of hoping there is still stock available in the future. And if you are expecting any major life changes soon (like expecting a baby), prepare for them now rather than later. 


* **Lifestyle Changes**


**WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY, FOR 20 SECONDS AT A TIME, WITH WARM WATER AND SOAP. AND ALSO STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE** Seriously, that is one of the things that can be most effective in protecting you from illness. You are far more likely to touch a contaminated surface and then touch your face than you are to get sneezed on by a sick person. Also, if your skin gets dried out, lotion up frequently to protect your skin. Because having micro abrasions on your hands from your skin peeling off isn't good for you either. 


Avoiding crowds is almost impossible to do in NYC, with many people taking the MTA systems to work. In any case, if there is any way to limit your exposure to other people on trains and busses, it would be wise to do so. The WHO has officially advised that people over 60 avoid crowded spaces worldwide, as they are the most at-risk for serious Covid-19 complications.


Get lots of fresh air in your apartments and offices. It has been shown to reduce transmission.


Masks are getting hard to get ahold of these days, but as it turns out, most brands are not going to be very effective in protecting you from viroid particles. They often lose effectiveness as they are worn throughout the day, and most masks cannot be re-used. If anything, it is wiser for the people who are already sick to wear the masks, as it can keep their respiratory droplets inside. 


And a mask is only as effective as the rest of the hygiene practice of the wearer. If the mask is not properly fitted, and if you’re going to touch a public handrail and then touch your face or itch your eye, you may as well not be wearing a mask at all. 


In fact, the US Surgeon General has urged the public to stop buying masks, as most of them are not effectively used. And to top it off, the healthcare workers who need them most are hitting mask shortages.


Oh, and did I mention yet to **avoid touching your face, frequently wash your hands,** and if you are wearing gloves, make sure to take off and change your gloves before touching yourself or any food. 


If you are able to, work remotely. In fact, Governor Cuomo has urged people to work remotely and stay off public transit if at all possible. And if you happen to be in charge of a company with employees, please make modifications to allow your employees to work remotely and limit exposure to others. While productivity may be higher in an office setting, it's going to be a lot lower if your employees are all in the hospital because you made them come in when it wasn't necessary. And certainly do what you can to make allowances for sick leave—the US’s habit of forcing people to come to work while sick to avoid losing their jobs or income is what leads to people spreading disease. 

If you are receiving deliveries for food or essentials, limit your contact with the delivery person (for both their safety and yours.) It is currently unknown exactly how long the virus can survive on surfaces, so it may be wise to let nonessential deliveries sit alone for a few days before you come in contact with them. However, [current research](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815307842/research-coronavirus-can-live-for-a-long-time-in-air-on-surfaces) suggests 24h for cardboard, up to 72h on stainless steel, and up to 3h in the air, in laboratory settings. Real life conditions (changes in temperature, sunlight exposure, etc.) may make those numbers go up or down. 


* **If you are feeling ill, or have recently been abroad to an affected country, be considerate and STAY INSIDE.**


As the disease begins to spread in the community, take careful consideration if you yourself begin to feel ill. Covid-19 doesn't have exactly the same symptoms in everyone, but the general consensus that people who fall ill will often experience cold and flu like symptoms, with approximately 80% developing a fever. If you are feeling sick, have a fever, or are coughing, stay home as much as possible and avoid other people, especially crowded places. Wear a mask and gloves in public, limit your contact with others, and wash your hands frequently to reduce the likelihood if you infecting others. When you go to the doctor's office, call ahead of time to let them know of your symptoms so they can take adequate precautions to protect staff and other patients in the event that you are infected. Don't just go about life as normal--even if you are experiencing relatively mild symptoms, you may spread the disease to someone who could very well die from it. So be considerate of others, and protect the other members of our community. 

If you are placed under a voluntary quarantine or isolation, actually follow through with it. You may feel fine, but there are many stories in the news of people who ended up violating quarantine to go to a concert, a school event, or some other crowded space. And of course, later tested positive. Don't be a selfish idiot, and protect your community. **In Italy, those who break quarantine are charged with murder,** because an ill person who goes about their daily lives may very well directly cause another's death. So stay inside if you are sick.  


* **Don’t Panic**


In the event that NYC asks residents to stay inside and limit public gatherings, it’s easy to get stressed out. Keep active and healthy through in-home exercise (online videos for home workouts are a great resource), and find something productive to occupy your day. Take up a new hobby, get some good eBooks to read, or get addicted to a new video game. It would be a good idea to buy whatever entertainment supplies you might need ahead of time, just in case. 


Be sure to keep up to date with the news, as well as the official CDC and WHO recommendations. We are learning more about the effects of this virus every day, and sometimes information that was thought to be correct later turned out to be false. Don’t make any major decisions out of panic, like don’t kill your pets because you read that somewhere in China, people were throwing cats and dogs off balconies. **Take adequate precautions, and also remember that we live in a society. If a neighbor in need requires help getting groceries or doing basic tasks, remember that a little humanity can go a long way.** Take adequate precautions to protect yourself, but don’t let fear and stress get the better of you. So maybe share some of that stockpiled food with a neighbor in need, or share your game console to the neighbor’s kid so they aren’t bored out of their minds.

"I just wanted to say, that God I pray Genesis is removed as manager from the ice center. The amount of employees that have been disrespected and as a result were fired or quit, the neglect to the building, the disgraceful pay of coaches, and their overall lack of knowledge about the skating and hockey community is profound. The fact that the city is even still considering genesis makes me sad. They really prioritize money over everything. 

And all of sudden, the ice center has been undergoing some LONG OVERDUE repairs. Genesis suddenly wants to act as though they care about the place, after years of neglect. It makes me sick. I am really hoping Genesis is removed as management but our city is so corrupt and Genesis has their fingers wrapped around some of our city commissioners.

"My two kids came down with coughs and runny noses so we all went to get tested at the free site on Aurora and 120th St. I signed my two kids up for appointments on the website the night before, but my husband and I were able to get tested as walk ins at the same time. The whole process was really fast and we waited less than ten minutes. They were great with the kids (they don’t stick the swab in very far with the younger ones) and it was just weirdly uncomfortable for the adults. It wasn’t painful. Just the feeling of something where it shouldn’t be, similar to water going up your nose, but more intense.

"For over a year I have had a black mold issue in the bathroom of my apartment.

I'm on the top floor and after a particularly stormy night, water was dripping through my bathroom ceiling. I submitted a maintenance request so the roof would get fixed asap. And as the leaking in my bathroom subsided, and the work order was marked as ""completed"" I had no reason to believe there was farther issue.

The day I first noticed the black mold I alerted the property manager and submitted a work order request. No action was taken. Months later, it had gotten much worse and I submitted another work order as well as contacted the property manager. The maintenance team bleached the bathroom ceiling and I was ensured that it was just a temporary fix. I was told they would replace the bathroom ceiling once the roof has been fixed. I was confused because the roof was messed up again?? But whatever. Several more months go by and the black mold has reemerged through the bleach. Big surprise. I sent ANOTHER work order and two weeks later maintenance knocks on my door asks if they can look at my bathroom. I'm like well yeah, and start talking about the mold. I am immediately cut off and they're oh no, we're here because the unit below you has a leak so we need to figure out why that is. (It was because of leaky shower handle that constantly leaks water. I asked them to fix it several months ago, but I guess they wanted to wait and see how bad it would get first!) Anyway, I asked they knew when they may get a chance to fix the ceiling and was told that they would be back to \*replace the ceiling\* the next day.

So, the next day arrives. I get home from school. They did NOT replace the ceiling. They painted over the mold. It's still visible through the paint!

I am so annoyed at this point. I've been lied to several times and they were given MULTIPLE chances to properly remove the black mold and failed to do so. This is a HUGE health hazard and they do not care at all! I decided it's time to contact someone about this and get it taken care of once and for all. I first reached out to my local Health Department. They said they can't help because they do not deal with mold. Next, I contacted Code Compliance who also told me they do not handle mold issues. I am flabbergasted and do not really know who else to contact/ what my next move is. 

I would really appreciate any other ideas or advice that y'all may have? I did think about an escrow, but I'm not 100% sure how that works and what I would need.

I am a student at Leeward CC and my group's final project is about potholes in this state.

"I'll keep it vague to not dime out my S/O but...

Y'all should know that during EVERY SINGLE dentistry appointment/exam/cleaning etc the Dr. has a legal requirement to examine you. No matter what. No matter how busy, or whatever excuse they give.

Apparently, some practices \*cough\* word that rhymes with dAspen \*cough\*, and some mom/pop shops do not examine their patients during cleanings or checkups for whatever reason.  It is black and white via state law, and the Alabama dental board/Alabama hygiene board that the dentist is required by law to examine every patient for every procedure.

If they do not, it's not only illegal but they can be subject to investigation and lose their license. So, if you have an exam and the dentist provides whatever excuse to not examine you and the hygienist or dental assistant tries pushing you out the door without seeing the DR., know your rights and know they are legally required to do so. You are paying the dentist for a service, they must provide it.

"I got a flyer in the mail today from Congressman Mike Turner.  In the flyer he claims to have introduced the Infant Act to address the baby formula crisis (AKA the ""Infants Need Food And Nutrition Today Act or INFANT Act""), AKA House Resolution 784.  A quick check of [Congress.Gov](https://Congress.Gov) shows the Congressman did NOT sponsor the bill, but instead Rep. Don Young from Alaska was the sponsor and it was introduced to the House on 3rd of Feb 2021 - over a year and a half ago.  Since then the bill has gone nowhere, referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.  In short it isn't even close to becoming law and probably won't since the ""crisis"" is essentially resolved, but that hasn't stopped Turner from claiming, in his flyer, ""Turner's bill combats baby formula crisis.""   Pure BS.

Rep Turner also claims to have SUPPORTED (not sponsored!) the Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022 which requires baby formula contracts to include a PLAN on how to combat future shortages. Note I capitalized the important word:  PLAN.  Nothing else, a plan.   A quick review of [Congress.Gov](https://Congress.Gov) revealed the bill was sponsored by Rep Hayes from CT and had 129 co-sponsors.  Rep Turner's name is not among the co-sponsors.  In fact of the 129 co-sponsors there are only two Republicans - Representatives Steel and Hayes.  Turner's name is no where to be seen as a co-sponsor.  Now he did support it by voting for it (9 Republicans in the House voted against it) so his claim of support is valid so the four formula makers that supply 90% of the infant formula in the USA now have to have a risk mitigation plan if things go awry in the future.  So basically this is a preventative measure for the future - not the past or current state. This Act was signed into law by President Biden on 21 May 2022.

Rep Turner also claims to have SUPPORTED the ""Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act"" to provide $28M in emergency funding to the FDA.  Again Rep Turner's name is not seen as a sponsor or co-sponsor per [Congress.Gov](https://Congress.Gov)  This bill has gone nowhere and is stuck in committee as of 17 May 2022 and hasn't been voted upon so I don't know what kind of support he claims to have provided.

Representative Turner also wrote in his flyer, ""The federal government should never get in the way of parents' ability to feed their children"" and ""the baby formula shortage is a product of the government's overreach in the marketplace.""   The overreach he is referring to, but doesn't spell out in the flyer is that FDA inspectors shut down Abbott's Sturgis plant that makes baby formula in Feb 2022 due to bacterial contamination, leaky roofs, and lax safety protocols. At the time, there  were reports of contaminated formula that may have been linked to the  deaths of two infants and the hospitalization of two other infants with  bacterial infections.   In short they were doing their job to protect this nation's babies from drinking formula that could make them sick or possibly die.  This is hardly ""overreach"" as Rep Turner writes in his flyer.  BTW, Abbot's Sturgis plant reopened and started producing formula again on 22 Jul 2022. 

BOTTOM LINE:  If you get a flyer or letter in the mail from a politician don't believe what they wrote.  They try to take credit for things they haven't done to make themselves look good in the eyes of constituents who take what politicians write (and say) on face value.  Do your research.

i have a couple of confirmed cases in my family we are a close family  and have been feeling tired at my training course. (very physically demanding). i stoped showing up once one of the confirmed cases reached my own house and not only at my uncles. i knew something was off about my body for a couple of days. slight fever and very fatigue was most of it. i told my instructor and he gave me 2 weeks off and i won't lose credit. i'm still showing barely any symptoms while my aunt is coughing her brains out and developed a sinus infection. i'm avoiding getting close but my main question is how can i get tested to see if i maybe don't have it (anymore) to go back to class if i barely show (ed) symptoms. i also don't have insurance|NewJersey|2020|True|1
So my friend who has a fever and a cough who might have the Coronavirus is not going to get tested because the  cost of testing is supposedly too high. In some cases already people have paid thousands of dollars, but, in my research I could not find a cost for NJ from a NJ health or Public Official.

I still dont know if I have it for sure yet, but let me tell ya. Whatever this is, it fucking sucks. Fever, coughing, muscle aches, headaches, breathing difficulties, badly congested. The congestion is what leads me to think it may be a bad flu thats not the coronavirus instead. But everything else is pretty on point. 

I’ve been isolating since Monday, but people I live with are starting to show early symptoms of mine.

It seems like these numbers are completely understated. There had to have been community infections. I have heard the story of an individual who is self quarantining with a possibles full blown case of the virus and this individual was told to stay home and monitor his condition that there were no tests available. This individual was also told by a health care professional not to go to the hospital unless his symptoms became life threatening or if his fever reached 103 or higher. It could b the flu, yes but it could also be the virus. Thoughts?|NewJersey|2020|True|0
"The past 2 days, I have experienced headache, sore eyes, chills and extreme fatigue. I didn’t want to shrug off the situation, so instead of directly heading to an urgent care without following the proper protocols, I called my town’s health department to let them know of my symptoms and that I didn’t want to show up at an urgent care unannounced since my symptoms are worrisome and I wouldn’t want to pose a risk on the public, just in case. Rather than giving me the proper guidance, I was hit with: “if you don’t have a fever, then you don’t need to contact us” and she immediately hung up afterwards. 

I don’t believe that response was at all appropriate as some people with COVID-19 are not only asymptomatic, but may only be showing a couple symptoms - which may exclude fever. I feel incredibly selfish for going to urgent care over something that I may be getting paranoid from given the current circumstances and using the limited resources when there may be people who are actually in dire need of emergency care (those who are immunocompromised, elderly, etc.). 

I have been staying in my house and avoiding all public contact. I work in a hospital and am not on the schedule until next week, but do not believe I should be going in at all. Where do I go from here?"|NewJersey|2020|True|1

"Hey everyone! 

My partner and I are planning to relocate from Queens, NY to Florida. His parents currently live by Bonita Springs. I lived in Brooklyn my whole life and recently moved to Queens as it’s closer to his work (carpenter for his family business). I’m not a fan of Queens as it’s much quieter and feel a sense of impending dread when I think of Florida because I can only see it being worse. 

Things to know:

We have a daughter and are expecting in September. Id hope to have another kid relatively soon after so it would be a three children household by the time we move. We hope to move within 1/1.5 years.

I don’t know how to drive and figure I’ll have to learn but still love walking and the convenience of the urban life I’ve been around forever. I was raised by Brighton beach so accessibility was never an issue when it came to different foods, nightlife, beach, park and activities for children. My mother made it a priority to expose me to culture and activities to the best of her ability when I was young and I had the privilege of going to museums, zoos, exhibits and so forth. 

While he prioritizes financial security, I also see no sense in moving somewhere we’d “have money” but we’d be miserable in. I value cultural diversity, accessibility and overall comfort within communities when it comes to human differences. I love how different and multicultural Brooklyn is and how accepting it is of people who step outside norms and various societal boundaries. 

I possess relatively “liberal” values and was raised outspoken when it comes to human rights issues, social acceptance for minority groups and overall equality regardless of race, gender and sexual orientation. These are values I hold really near to my heart and stimulated me going into education to teach as I believe children need a voice/support and educators can provide that. While I currently do not work, I’m finishing up my masters in education which involves student teaching which I would prefer to do when we relocate so I can better adjust to Floridas school systems. 

His father is sick and ultimately it’s important for both of us to be close to our family which is a big reason as to why we’re planning on moving. My mother might eventually move to Florida as well but it would only be near a city while his parents live in a pretty rural area. 

Is it possible to find a place there where we’d both be happy? I’m willing to make the move anywhere to be with him but I also don’t wanna crumble under the culture shock and wish to have our children raised with a good education as well as overall ethics and morals. He states I focus on politics too much when we can have a nice quiet comfortable life there but I feel as though the stereotypes of florida and stories on the news regarding schools and community values go against everything I hold close to my heart. I’ve never lived there so I constantly think maybe I am being narrow minded of the culture there as most of my information I get online. 

Does a multicultural, accessible and safe part of florida exist? Let alone a place that’s affordable, has a future for a carpentry business and happiness for children? It doesn’t have to be a city and I’ll definitely learn to drive , I’ve come to terms with it not being Brooklyn. But does any place come sorta close?"|Florida|2023|True|0

" There has been a huge amount of discussion around the compulsory acquisition of Calvary Hospital. We have heard from both sides plus various other politicians, clergy, ex-doctors, anonymous doctor(s), a former PM etc but I thought I might offer a different side from someone who has worked in Canberra Hospital, Calvary Hospital, University of Canberra Hospital and in community health.  
 

In short, the health system in ACT sucks. But it's more than just saying Canberra Hospital is poorly run. It's important to go into where the problems are, as this helps understand ACT Gov's actions.  
 

Canberra Hospital’s poor performance is because it is understaffed, it has a poor work culture and there aren't enough beds. Each of these factors perpetuate the other. Lack of beds generates a poor culture as staff are pushed to work faster and harder as they can , each department argues about who is responsible for the care of each patient. This, in turn makes ACT an unattractive place to work and hence more staff leave, worsening the culture for those that stay.  
 

Calvary Hospital is similar. There are no beds on the wards for people in ED waiting for admission. They have to stay in an ED bed until one on the ward becomes available, which leaves no space for new people coming to ED to be seen. It's called ''bed block'' and it's very common. The staffing issues are the same at Calvary as at Canberra hosp, not enough staff and poor staff management. I have to say that the culture is better at Calvary, but it is not due to any greater management or pride in the Calvary mission. It's because it is a smaller hospital. The staff tend to know each other and the patients are generally less acutely unwell since the traumas, risky surgeries etc. go to Canberra hosp, reducing the stress on Calvary staff.  
 

ACT Gov is trying to improve the culture in Canberra hospital. At least it says it is. Now it's trying to improve the lack of beds and services. It needs a larger northside hospital to cater for the booming northside population and, frankly, Calvary has refused to help. It has been pretty happy accepting ACT Gov's money to make necessary improvements such as an ICU, ED expansion, multistorey parking, while putting its own money into building a private hospital next door. It looks like now the ACT Gov is sick of paying for improvements only for those assets to immediately belong to Calvary. From what I can that leaves 3 options:

**Option 1:** Build another hospital somewhere else. But then we still have to fulfill the contract with Calvary to provide healthcare in a superfluous yet not-fit-for-service hospital.

**Option 2**: keep paying Calvary (a private company) with public money to upgrade their asset. 

**Option 3:** The compulsory acquisition. Not ideal and the way it has been handled and communicated has been terrible, but it does seem to be the better of 3 poor options.

An increase in beds and services will directly help more patients in a timely manner, reduce stress on staff leading to improved culture and hopefully attract more workers, improving the overall performance of Canberra’s health system.  


I also think the abortion/euthanasia aspect of the debate is grossly over-stated. For starters IF euthanasia is introduced, I think it will be an out of hospital ‘service’. If you need to be in hospital and want to stop life sustaining treatment, that is palliative care which is provided in both hospitals. If you don’t require a hospital admission then Calvary’s position doesn’t matter. Similarly with abortion, any first trimester abortions are available in the community, and most late term terminations are in high risk/complicated pregnancies that are already under the care of the foetal medical unit, and that’s because it is a service for a tertiary hospital, not because Calvary refuse to do it. In the few cases outside the above scenarios, it would be better performed in a single facility that does it more often than two hospitals less frequently just for the principle of it."|canberra|2023|True|0

"I thought it might be useful to collate a list of restaurants that manage their own deliveries, and don't outsource to underpaid delivery drivers. Ideally, please identify the:

The Republican war on education and our libraries continues with the full support of our Governor.

Despite all of the terrible flaws that this bill has, it has passed. Any books containing sexual education materials or LGTBQ characters are now legally considered obscene.

Now anyone, even people who do not live in Idaho, can file a complaint about library materials to attempt to have them moved into age restricted(18+) areas. If they dont, the library risks being sued. Libraries that do not have this as an option will either have to completely remove those books or make their libraries open only to adults.

This makes me sick and i'm unbelievably disgusted that our legislators continue to pass bills crafted by the Idaho Family Policy Center, an openly Christian Nationalist organization. This state will be ruined as long as we allow religion to drive our laws and policy.

"I booked my first dose in early September when they finally approved intradermal method which allowed for a lot more appointments to open up. I was told I would have to wait 2 months in between but few days ago they announced I was eligible to get it after the recommended 4 weeks as they’re allowing anyone to get the vaccine starting Oct 6. Super easy to [schedule an appointment online](https://vax4nyc.nyc.gov/patient/s/monkeypox)

I got both doses done intradermally. Here some [photos](https://imgur.com/a/fMhCzE8), I wasn’t good about taking photos daily. 

First dose:
Day 0 - got the shot, little bubble but no swelling or redness or itchiness. I went to the LIC and it was super organized and set up was great. People were super helpful and no waiting. They check your ID and ask the same screening questions multiple times. After the shot, someone is assigned to monitor you for 15 min as you wait. I went about my day afterwards. The whole thing took about 25 min

Day 1 - injection site got more swollen and red and itchy. I felt super tired and my body was a little weak. Had a small headache but no fever or chills

Day 2 - injection site even more swollen and itchier. I’m allergic to mosquito bites so that’s what it looked and felt like. More annoying than alarming. I tried my best not to scratch it. Felt tired still

Day 3~7 - itchiness peaked at day 3&4 and it looked pretty bad. By day 5, swelling and itchiness went down

Day 8~21 - formed a little red bump. Itchiness gone

Day 22-28 - less red and fading into a dark purple scar/bruise. Still a little bump and skin started to peel on the bump

I’m on day 2 of second shot and expect to go through the same thing. The first week feels the worst because it looks and feels like an infected bug bite. Itchy as fuck

Anyways there’s not much info out there on side effects from getting it intradermally so I’m just sharing my experience and I’m happy I got it."|NewYorkCity|2022|True|0

"Hello Everyone,

I’m a healthcare worker at one of RI’s major hospitals. There is a lot of talk about the “4th wave” on Reddit and particularly in the RI subreddits so I thought you all may be interested in an update “from the trenches” so to speak.

Firstly, the 4th wave is here and it’s nothing to scoff at. The number of COVID hospitalizations have doubled since October. The ICUs at Kent, Roger Williams, Fatima, Newport and South County are either full or above capacity. RI hospital last reported 92% capacity. I can’t transfer my sickest patients to get the level of care they need because there simply aren’t beds for them. These aren’t COVID patients either, it’s cardiac, trauma, and other surgery patients, I can’t transfer them for surgery because there is no ICU bed for them to recover from their open heart procedure in. I have patients who need ICU level of care and monitoring who are being treated in the ED by ICU staff because all the beds in the main unit are full.

RI’s percent positive of COVID tests went from 1.6% in late October to 5.2% on December 4th (on track to go even higher when the next dataset comes out). We have nearly 200 hospitalized covid patients in a state with only about  2,500 total hospital beds. Nearly 10% of all hospital beds in RI are filled by covid patients.  On Thursday alone we had 1,000 new confirmed cases *in a single day*.

If that wasn’t bad enough we now also have our first confirmed omicron variant case. While it is (probably) less severe, it appears to be much more transmissible and virulent which means the strain it will cause on our already near-crippled healthcare system will be significant. Even if these omicron patients do well, the beds they will take up to  recover are precious and few.

Of my 4 man team 3 have fallen ill and are home. We manage 30-40 patients between us. Our scheduling and backup system is near collapse. My shifts have gone from 5:30-5:30 to 5:30-7:30 6 days per week. We are all tired. We are all sick. We are short staffed. I have to wait literal days to get an MRI or Ultrasound on my patients. None of us feel like we are providing the quality of care our patients deserve. It seems like literally overnight I went from having 1-3 covid patients on my list to 10-20.

Most of the hospitalized are unvaccinated from my personal experience. Most of those who end up very sick or dying are unvaccinated. Anecdotally I personally have never seen a vaccinated covid patient die. I have seen several unvaccinated patients die. The data on the vaccine shows that those who are vaccinated are *significantly* less likely to be hospitalized or die from the virus. In my own practice I see this play out day after day. I see vaccinated COVID+ 90 year olds (with laundry lists of comorbidities) chilling out on 2 liters of oxygen while unvaccinated 30 year olds lie silently weeping on 10.

Please, you can help us by getting the jab, staying at home, and masking up whenever you are around others. This is not the flu. Our state’s healthcare system cannot take much more of this.

EDIT:

I feel the need to include this: None of my teammates has ever suggested or considered quitting, giving up, or giving anything less than 100% for our patients. I am simply providing some insight on the current state of the RI hospital system. We don’t want sympathy, We don’t want praise. We just want a fighting chance. We want society to do their part so we can keep doing ours.

Edit 2

Thank you for all your kind words. Please you don’t have to thank me, and please stop awarding this post. Save your coins. We are just doing our jobs. I didn’t make this post looking for compliments, I just wanted people to know how severe things are getting. Nobody outside of healthcare seems to have noticed.

So I'm not a smart man, but it doesn't appear like maine is experiencing exponential growth of the Covid-19 virus. A few months ago we were hovering at like 20-30 cases a day. Then that number shot up to the low hundreds, then quickly made it to the two hundreds. I'm certainly not complaining, but I'm just curious why we seem to be hovering in the mid 200s for the last 3 weeks. Sure we've closed down some schools, investigated some outbreaks, limited indoor capacity, and curfewed businesses at 9:00 pm. Are those actions whats kept us from continuing to see daily cases growth? Or are there other metrics that I should be looking at?|Maine|2020|True|0
"Hi all - Just a general warning, particularly to runners and bikers. I was running along the lake on the cement between the Planetarium and the water at about 2:30pm, and there two fishing lines strung from the steps out into the water about 3 ft above the ground.

"I've literally never been so frustrated over a damn trash can! I've lived in my house for 4 years and had no problems with trash pick up until this year. This year, we started off with the trash man dumping half our barrel back into our yard. We live on a busy road, so we understand that it can be hard to collect trash, but after the 4th time of coming home on a Monday and spending an hour cleaning trash out of the yard, we're sick of it. We called Waste Management, they gave us a number to call the city and complain and they said they'd be more careful. Cool, except not cool, be cause the very next pick up, my husband caught the guy driving truck dumping MORE trash into our yard! Ever since then, we've never had a clean or good trash pick up. These past 2 months, the garbage collector started destroying our barrel. Wheels are gone, giant crack up the side, and this last time, he took the lid for good measure. For the past 3 weeks it's been nothing but circles to get a new can. We call the city, they give us Waste Managements number. We call them, they send us back to the city and that they're ""escalating the issue."" I finally pulled out the Karen card and asked for a manager and number and was immediately hung up on twice after the transfer. 
I just want a new can and to get my trash picked up on Mondays without an hour work of cleaning my yard. Can anyone help me, please?! I just don't even know what to do at this point. "|Indianapolis|2024|True|0

"I don’t wanna sound…..idk weird or strange. I am 27 years old I’m a man. I’ve lived here about two years. I work remotely then also work at a restaurant where I have met a few people. But it’s mostly people that I don’t want to hang out with and they are into heavier things than I am. 

Idk where or how to meet people. I feel like I’m either at home or at work, or at the gym. But I’m not social at the gym bc I have headphones.

I want to meet friends and potential romantic interests and just….socialize. I’m feeling so desolate and all I have is my family and my agoraphobic roommate.

"Hey all! I'm that lady who has been waiting since January to renew my lease at Riverbend I finally got a call today and was informed that my rent would be increased to $1735 from $1650. I was promised $1660 by the previous company. I've been emailing and calling the new management since April when they took over and my lease was supposed to renew that month. Because I agreed to sign in January when it's slow, I got a break. 

I spoke with the property manager and he pretty much admitted that they held up my renewal and 300 others until after an ""assessment"" by the higher ups. He has the email paper trail and is going to send it all to them and give me a decision tomorrow. I agreed to $1675 to account for the addition of Valet Trash.

"We have neighbors who moved in a couple years ago. They got a lab-ish looking puppy who is now probably 3 years old. They have a fenced backyard, but the they let the dog out in the front yard loose with them. I’ve been able to pick up my dog each time, but this is going to create reactivity in my own dogs because of their failure to contain their dogs. Dog has sprinted full speed directly at my senior dog, adult dog and puppy, barks and snaps at them. Zero warning. I’ve tried avoiding their house, but can’t always and now I’m just sick of it. Loads of us have dogs. And this isn’t an issue with anyone else.

It just happened with my new puppy on Saturday and today. And now I’m sick of it. I’ve emailed Animal Control. I plan to call them on Monday. Who else do I need to contact?  We’re in a neighborhood without an HOA in Indianapolis on the north east side. 

I’m not trying to get the dog euthanized, but me talking to the neighbors hasn’t resulted in any change at all and they’ve continued to let the dog be loose out front for 6 months now. When they see us coming they hold her collar and hide her behind a car so she can’t see our dogs. But many times they’re not paying attention and she just charges us. 

So I’m sick of it and I want to scare them a little into taking this more seriously.

"The short story: I have shunned organized religion for years because of personal experience and the way it divides and creates conflict in the world. A recent funeral has made me want to get involved in a church / religious group again. I am seeking a place that is community focused, nonjudgmental, supports the LGBTQIA+ community, is pro choice, and focuses on community outreach (ie spending more time acting on the teachings of Jesus than talking about them). 

The long story: I went to a funeral recently that made me rethink church and religion and what it all means. I am hoping to get some guidance and suggestions from the community, especially since I am new to Indianapolis. 

The funeral was different than any I have ever been to. There were gospel readings and all the religious stuff, but it was ultimately focused on who she was as a person, what she cared about and the impact she made. During the service they had people raise their hands to talk about her and the impact she had on them. A lot of the people that spoke were people that met her through their church. They all talked about how she had made them feel so welcomed and took the time to get to know them. How your church community can become your family. I knew her, and hearing these stories reaffirmed that she was the amazing woman that I knew, but it also showed me that there are religious communities filled with people like her.

For background, I was raised Catholic and my brother and I were made to go to Catholic school. We were both bullied. My brother was bullied so terribly by not only his peers, but a teacher and the principal, that my parents transferred him to the public school. They forced me to stay, which they now regret. One of my closest friends passed away suddenly and tragically a few weeks before graduation. She went to the public school and her death impacted the entire community. You would think a Catholic school would be understanding of the situation even though she wasn’t one of their students, but they weren’t. There were two people at the school who were understanding and gave me grace. Neither were Catholic, hah. 

The worst offender was my religion teacher, a priest, who scolded me for taking the final exam at a different time than the rest of the class. I could barely read the questions because my eyes were so f*ed up from crying. 

He’s also the same one that, a few months previously, screamed at me because I threw up in his classroom on my first day back to school after having surgery. I went back to school earlier than my doctor recommended because the vice principal called my mom and said if I missed any more days of school she wouldn’t let me graduate. Apparently my good attendance before I got sick, great grades and acceptance to a competitive college weren’t good enough. Ugh. She made me sit in her office after school for weeks to do “make up hours.” 

I say all of the above to express that I am not interested in attending a church that just talks about God, Jesus and what the Bible says. I grew up with that and the ones spewing it were the last ones to follow it. I also have no interest in an organization that uses religion as an excuse to hate and condemn others. 

At the end of the day, I am looking for a place that praises god by going out and doing his work to help people. I want to be part of a group that takes the Lord’s teachings and applies them to life. I appreciate any advice and guidance, thanks! "|Indianapolis|2024|True|0

Hey all.  Anyone know about viruses and stuff going around?  Feeling like hell for a few days now. Tested negative for Covid.  Pollen is actually low so it's making me thing virus or something.  I think there's a flu bug going around.  Maybe I'm just rotting in place.........  ):|Philadelphia|2022|True|1
"I've pretty much run out of coping mechanisms to handle the anxiety from Covid these days. It seems the last 2 years has removed them one by one.

I'm autistic, an introvert and don't have many friends. I require a fairly simple life to cope. I don't do or like sport and have a disability so am limited in the sports I can do.

I used to go bush waking and down to the coast a fair bit to recharge. At the start of 2020 we had the bushfires in Namadgi which burned the areas I used to love bushwalking in. So there went that mechanism. Some roads have reopened, but the bridges and culverts to Orroral Valley, Lego Land and Bomboora Rocks are still closed. Thankfully the track to Gibraltar Falls re-opened but now I can't go there because I live in NSW.

Then I used to go down the coast to recharge. Then Covid came along, and from time to time, including now, that is not an option. 

I also used to go kayaking on Lake Burly Griffin and up to Gibraltar falls because that would help. But I live in NSW, and can't go to either of those locations either.

I can't go to book shops to get a book and libraries are closed, as are the book shops I think. 

Then I'd work on converting a van to a motorhome but now Bunnings is interstate and the local hardware stores don't have the supplies I need.

All of my former coping mechanisms for mental health are gone. I've already had to call the crisis team once for extreme suicidal thoughts and for the first time in my life actually starting to put a plan in action. Today I was speaking to a psychologist and mentioned all this and they started talking about deep breathing. I said a couple of times that I had tried that in the past and it didn't work for me but they kept on talking about it. I just had to end that conversation as it was clear they were not listening to me, or not taking on board what I was saying. Sure I respect that what they were talking about might work for them, and others, but they were disregarding what I was telling them.

So I'm all out of coping mechanisms and ideas. I SO want to go up to Gibraltar falls on a sunny day, but also SO understand the reasons why I can't. Not spreading potential Covid is very important. I have had a headache and flu like symptoms over the past day and today so I got a Covid test this morning. Still not got the results back yet though.

I feel like I am at my wit's end, and am just struggling to cope. I'm also getting fed up with mental health workers saying ""Oh you're so resilient."" I've worked out that's code for ""You're going through a lot of shit, I'm amazed you're still here.""

So yeah, any coping strategies that are suitable for introverts that hate sport? Oh yeah, I don't drink, smoke or use drugs either so hey, don't go suggesting them please. :)"|canberra|2021|True|0

"While I think whether other measures stick around post-pandemic might still be up for debate, Masks are probably gonna be permanent at this point. The doctors are  saying we’ll need them even after a vaccine is distributed, due to asymptomatic spread, and are now talking about how in addition to helping fight Covid, wearing them would drastically reduce the number of deaths during flu season. There’s no counter argument to that that doesn’t sound selfish. If you tell people they can save others from the flu by wearing a mask, they’re gonna do it. If the flu season comes and there’s significantly less deaths this year than usual, the doctors will hail it as a proof of concept regarding masks effectiveness. 

They might be a small anti-mask crowd remaining but more and more people will begin to comply over time and it will become the new cultural norm in a few years.

I would love ideas as well as experiences. For example hiking places you've tried that were quiet vs ones that there was very little social distancing. Drive ins that did the process safely vs things you'd recommend someone high risk avoid.

"You all may remember my Coronavirus posts over the past year, which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/fcbcem/covid19_coronavirus_preparedness_announcement/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/fm8e5a/covid19_announcement_part_2quarantine_edition/). Over the summer, we saw a decline in cases, in large part due to the warmer weather and people being responsible about gatherings and mask wearing. But as fall and winter bring colder weather, people are forced to spend more time indoors. And additionally, coronavirus fatigue is real. We’re all tired of not seeing our friends and family, and limiting contact with other humans. We’re tired of limiting grocery trips, and doing online shopping instead of going to stores. We’re worried about our local storefronts, bars, and restaurants surviving financially, and we want to feel normal again. 


**Quite frankly, this is exhausting, and we’re ready to be done with restrictions. But Covid doesn’t care.**


In 1918, there were many waves of the Spanish Flu. The second wave was by far the most deadly. And while our current treatments for Covid are far more effective than what we had during the first wave, there is still very much a real danger for severe illness. In addition to staying on top of the [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/need-to-know.html), here are some things we can do for the coming winter. 


**Wear your mask! And don’t forget to clean reusable masks!**


In the early days of the pandemic, it was thought that mask wearing wouldn’t be effective. Why? Because viruses are very tiny, and most masks (with the exception of N95), were not thought to have a fine enough mesh to properly filter it. It was thought that the virus would go straight through a cloth or surgical mask, while giving the wearer a false sense of security. 


However, recent data shows that this isn’t the case. Masks, even cloth ones, are still effective. Not only does it keep the virus from spreading outwards from an infected person, it also protects uninfected people. New research indicates that being exposed to small amounts of virus through a mask helps “inoculate” you, and [prepares your immune system](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/health/covid-masks-immunity.html). So if you do get infected, it will likely be less severe. In addition, cloth masks keep the air you are exposed to in a smaller bubble. So you’re not breathing the whole room, you’re breathing from a smaller pocket near your face. 


If you are wearing a reusable mask, [wash it frequently](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wash-cloth-face-coverings.html). Over time, oils and other gunk build up in the mask and make it less effective (and harder to breathe through!) 


**Stockpile responsibly.**


Many stores nationwide are starting to reinstitute ration limits on items such as toilet paper. Don’t just run to the store and buy everything you’ll need for the winter all at once—that puts a strain on the system. But it’s not a bad idea to buy a little more at a time, so you can limit risky grocery trips in the future. Don’t forget to make sure your nutritional needs are met when you stock up. Instant Ramen and frozen pizza isn’t going to keep you healthy all winter.


**Keep an eye on emerging research on preventive health.** 


Every day, new studies are released that show how different factors can impact covid risk. We know that things like age, smoking, and obesity can put individuals in a higher risk bracket for severe Covid. But other lifestyle factors, such as having enough Vitamin D in your diet, can potentially reduce the risk of severe illness. While we can’t say for sure yet which factors matter the most, it definitely doesn’t hurt to take a daily multivitamin, quit smoking, and lose weight. 


**There are several vaccines in development right now, with promising results.**


But don’t stake all your hopes on things immediately going back to normal once the vaccines arrive. After all, we all know how many people are reluctant to vaccinate their children against horrible illnesses, despite decades of research and proven results. With a new vaccine that just hit the market, I wouldn’t hang on to the hopes that everyone is just going to stand in line when they don’t even regularly get a flu shot. 


In addition, we don’t have large population data to say how effective these vaccines will be. We don’t even know for sure if they’ll be effective for very long—as new strains of the virus evolve (such as the concerning strain coming out of Danish Mink farms), we must face the real possibility that the vaccines we’ve been developing won’t be effective against new strains of the virus. 


On the other hand, things might be much better than expected. Maybe people will be so desperate to get back to normal that they all will get vaccinated, and we can kick Covid’s butt. But don’t stake all your hopes on that. 


**Keep your guard up, and fight the Covid Fatigue**. 


We are all so freaking tired of this. But we keep seeing that with loosening restrictions, the virus explodes. And don’t mistake a rule or law for being necessarily the best course of action. Indoor dining being open doesn’t mean that indoor dining is safe. 

Figure out what you need to do to stay sane, and do it safely. If you need regular socialization, try to figure out a way to do it online (a group gaming server, perhaps?) or outdoors with appropriate distance. Games like tennis are a far safer way to get exercise than going to the gym. 

Keep yourself busy by starting new hobbies, or picking up old ones. If you find yourself bored inside with lots of free time, try taking an online course to keep your mind active, or pick up a hands-on hobby that you can get lost in. 

**If you are in a position of power over a business, invest in safety infrastructure.** 

Now would be a great time to review your company’s sick leave policy, and ensure that jobs that can be done remotely *are* done remotely. Be mindful of your employee’s family situations. If they are immunocompromised, or live with someone who is vulnerable, try to be understanding. Keep businesses well ventilated with outdoor air, and enforce mask policies. 

If you can, install as many hands-free options as possible. See if you can install automatic doors, automatic hand sanitizer dispensers, door hinges that can swing both ways so people can open them with their feet, automatic toilet flushes, paper towel dispensers, and sinks. Arrange things in such a way that minimizes contact between customers, and allows people to get in and out as quickly as possible. Invest in online and curbside business. Protect your employees—give them plexiglass shields to minimize their contact with customers. And stand up for them if they need to enforce a policy with a customer. Safety first. 


**Keep being human, and be a good neighbor.**


So many people have lost their jobs during this pandemic, or are in financial strain. If you are in a position to help out your neighbors or friends, do so safely. Maybe cook a little extra food if you know someone who needs a healthy meal. Help non-tech savvy neighbors or elderly people navigate online shopping or meal delivery. Help people sign up for assistance programs that they qualify for, and let them know about things like [New York City's Free Meal Program,](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/food/community-meals) and be understanding if the family that lives above you is making a bit more noise than they used to.

The ACT’s health chiefs have two key messages for Canberrans worried about the impact of coronavirus: there is no need to stock up on goods such as toilet paper, and wash your hands with soap and water.

At a media briefing today (4 March), they were at pains to say that the ACT was well prepared to deal with coronavirus (or COVID-19), and as the number of cases rise across Australia, they expect to see the Territory’s first case in the next four to six weeks.

They acknowledged that the situation could worsen as the ACT headed into winter and flu cases increased, so they urged Canberrans to get a flu shot when they become available.

In the meantime, they said panic buying of the sort that cleaned out supermarket shelves of items such as toilet paper and rice at Woolworths at Cooleman Court in Weston on Tuesday night was unnecessary, and that basic hand hygiene used to limit flu transmission should be employed.

Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said she understood people’s concern given what has happened in China but the situation in the ACT was likely to be very different and health services were ready to go if and when they need to.

“We strongly encourage people not to panic buy and hoard. We have enough of everything in Australia. What [Canberrans] need to do is make sure they have enough soap at home,” she said.

The relatively small number of arrivals from overseas in the ACT has bought the Territory some time to fully prepare and, at this stage, health authorities are looking to contain any cases in the community, away from hospitals.

Officials say anybody returning from China or Iran is being asked to self-quarantine at home.

Anybody with flu-like symptoms who has recently been overseas should see their GP or go to a Walk-in Centre, but first call ahead so staff can take precautions. If they test positive, patients will also be asked to self-quarantine at home. Their contacts in the previous 24 hours will also be tracked.

If necessary, NGOs and Community Services will be able to provide wrap-around support so people will not go without while quarantined at home.

A number of options were on the table to keep pressure of hospital emergency departments (ED), including in-home testing by paramedics, a telephone triage line, online support and in-home support.

Officials say that with information still coming in about the virus, health services need to be adaptive and flexible as the situation evolves.

If and when the number of cases escalates, the ACT’s hospitals will tap their surge capacity to assess and treat people.

Canberra Health Services CEO Bernadette McDonald said Calvary Public and the Canberra Hospital had tightened infectious disease protocols, there were negative pressure treatment rooms in place and staff had personal protective personal equipment.

She was also looking at a respiratory assessment clinic at Canberra Hospital away from the ED.

“We will maintain our normal services for as long as possible, dependent on the spread and how unwell people are. We will need to keep monitoring and looking at when is the time to surge up, when is the time that our core business starts to get impacted by this,” she said.

With all public hospitals across Australia already at capacity, any such surge will hit other services such as elective surgery, potentially swamp EDs and call on beds in other areas.

Health ministers have made it clear to the Commonwealth that the states and territories will likely need more support to get through.

Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said the ACT was not considering any public control measures such as school closures or banning public gatherings.

“Quite frankly, if we get to a situation where we had very widespread COVID-19 in the community, there is limited usefulness in cancelling events and stopping people going out to community events because they are still going to be with people at work and school,” she said.

“It depends on the circumstances whether you shut down a single school; I’d be very surprised if we get to that.”

Chief Health Officers have the power to issue public health directions and there were also powers under the Emergencies Act if necessary but these are considered a last resort."|canberra|2020|True|0
Does anyone know where I can get a flu shot for free ( or very cheap, <$10) WITHOUT insurance? I do have an insurance card from a plan I recently had - if I were to take that to a CVS, would they actually check to make sure it’s currently valid before they gave me the shot? This is a ghetto idea, but obviously I’m poor and not above that. Thanks for any ideas!|Portland|2019|True|0
"Will you please share your experiences with canine influenza? Our Rottweiler is 9, we've had her 7 of those years, she's had all of her shots, and has never been sick. About a week ago she started acting a little lazier than usual, but nothing concerning. We were getting ready to travel to California for my son's wedding, and the night before we flew out she was extremely lethargic, would only drink water and had zero interest in food. She was still going out to potty, etc. Our daughters pet sitter kept a close eye on her, kept her hydrated, but none of us really knew what was going on. Once we got back from the wedding, I had more time to observe her, and she checked every box for the canine influenza. We live in a gated community, and practically everyone has a dog, it's very clean here, but that doesn't mean viruses don't circulate. I've read that it can last up to 3 weeks, and live on surfaces for 48 hours, she's responding well to the children's Robitussin honey DM, she has started to pose interest in food but still won't eat solids. I purchased a medicine syringe, and I'm giving her doses of chicken bone broth and unrefined coconut oil. She is drinking water, and a lot of it. She's looking better by the day, but this would be the entry of week 2 so I know there's more to come.

I was very sick back in October 2019 with what I thought was the regular flu, it lasted about 2 weeks and the symptoms where exact for what is described as the Coronavirus. I've lost my sense of smell to this day,  which many reporters from recovered patients shows to be a side effect. Did anyone else get very sick with Cov19 symptoms in Delaware last quarter of 2019? Im beginning to think this was around in the US prior to Jan 2020 which is when they say it first arrived here.|Delaware|2020|True|0
"Hi Boise, 

I have been sick for the last 10 days with flu like symptoms but not a hint of respiratory symptoms. Fever, chills, body aches, headaches, vomiting, skin rashes/scratchy skin, insatiable thirst. The symptoms are not all the time and change from day to day.

I went to urgent care 4 days in and tested negative for flu/Covid /cold, urine looked good too. 6 days in, I attempted to take a shower and lost my vision and was able to make it to my bed before falling - no color in face and lips slightly blue. Went to ER. Had chest x-ray, blood work, and ultrasound of my right side organs. Bloodwork showed signs of my body fighting something. Negative for cold/flu/Covid/RSV, urine looked good again. ER believes it’s some sort of virus they do not test for and to drink lots of water, rest, and it should resolve itself. 

Now I’m on day 10 (4 days since ER), and still feel like garbage and no diagnosis. 

Boise - has anyone had or is anyone having similar symptoms? We’re you able to pinpoint what the cause was? How long did the symptoms last for?"|Boise|2023|True|1
Started getting sinus pain Friday night which developed into a bad headache Saturday. This was followed by a 102 fever that fluctuates between 98 and 102 but stays around 99-100. Hasn’t subsided. No cough, no insane congestion. Tested negative for strep, Covid, and flu. |KansasCity|2024|True|1
"Not sure if this has been mentioned but just in case. 
Stay Alert: Avian Flu Could Arrive in Australia

Australia and New Zealand are the only places left without reported cases of the highly pathogenic Avian Flu (HPAI-H5N1).

With migratory shorebirds and seabirds arriving this spring and summer, there’s a chance the virus could come with them.

What to do if you see sick or dead birds:

Don’t touch them or feathers 
Keep pets and kids away.

"Hi. Here's some small advice for when you shop and Stop & Shop.

* Make sure to scan your card/enter your phone number at the savings station once you walk into the store to quickly load in the Digital Coupons. (Ex. In Hamden, the Savings Station is located on the produce side right at the end of Register 21)
* Hamden Stop & Shop closes at midnight every day unless otherwise
* If a sale is too good to be true, double check the location of an item and the tag or ask a store associate before purchasing
* At Hamden Stop & Shop, the doors on the Pharmacy side close at 8pm every night for safety reasons
* At Hamden Stop & Shop, since August 25th of this year, the service desk closes at 7pm.
* Want to keep track of how much you are spending? Pick up a Scan It by the door once you enter the store or use the Scan It app on your phone. It will also, make things go by quicker for both the cashier and the customer. 
* Want to use your Go Points for groceries? Redeem them through the App or the website. Every 100 points is $1 off in groceries.
* Monday-Saturday the store stops selling alcohol at 10pm. On Sundays, the store stops selling alcohol at 6pm.
* Purchasing cold medicine? Make sure to an ID on you. If it has Pseudoephedrine in it, the employee will need to see your ID. *(Pseudoephedrine is found in a number of cold-and-flu tablets, and is known to be an “illicit drug precursor” because it can be diverted into the manufacture of amphetamine-type substances. In some states, only people 18 years of age or older can buy pseudoephedrine.)*

"I’ve been clubbing in Europe, and I love it there. They play awesomely stylish music, and the flu-goers came there to dance, experience the music, and maybe mingle with like-minded people. 

Here in Boston, I see a lot of boorish ex-athletes wearing bad sports clothes strategizing in the corner with their nursed cheap beer, and the music that’s played always features Beyoncé’s “Crazy In Love” and maybe Notorious BIG’s “Juicy.”  **Why is this a tradition here?** Also, at our clubs, people aren’t that fashionable, and it seems that people just want to drink and pick up chicks. 

I think that I’m really just craving a dance-oriented place similar to what one finds in Berlin, London or Paris with non-boorish crowds, and a fresher music-scene. 

Am I the only one overly-annoyed that we’re still listening to Beyoncé’s “CIL?”"|Boston|2022|True|0
"Hi,

I have not had much experience with medical care in the US and I want to show myself to a primary care. I've been having flu-like symptoms for a week and tested negative (antigen test) for covid on Friday, but not feeling better. I registered for MGH only to be told that they are not accepting new patients till October.

What other options for primary care do I have? Any specific recommendations? I live in Assembly row and would prefer something convenient with the T.

EDIT: It was Mass General Brigham with which I registered, not MGH

EDIT 2: Thank you all! I did not know that I should be looking at an urgent care for this. Got an appointment for this evening at an urgent care downtown so glad it worked out - thanks for all your references

EDIT3: The appointment went pretty smooth. It was at Carbon Health downtown and they often have same-day available appointments if needed. I tested positive for covid this time. Now just stuck at home :(

Thanks!"|Boston|2022|True|1

Hello, this question is for current registered nurses. I had a question regarding the vaccine requirement. So I just got into a nursing program no problem. I was fully vaccinated with 3 boosters back in 2021/2022, but each time, I was hospitalized for nearly a week due to anaphylaxis and severe reactions. I wanted to know if most places/hospitals/HCF  require the covid shot specifically like a yearly flu or because I was already vaccinated will I be good for future employment? Just want to mentally and physically prepare myself if I have to go through that again lol I will say, after dose 2, I went in to dose 3 with an epi on stand by and that reaction was a bit better than the prior 2. I know flu shot is a yearly requirement, but I never have severe reactions to that as I did with covid for some reason. Thank you for any info yall can give!|Connecticut|2024|True|0

"It might just be me, but I get so annoyed and frustrated with businesses that are still working on a 'Cash Only' basis. I understand businesses like little stalls at Queen Vic market (even though the majority are now taking Eftpos), but a fish and chip close to where I live to insist that they cant do cards. Not only that, but they have an ATM installed inside their business, expecting you to take money out of their ATM that happens to charge an extra $2.50 to get cash out.

&#x200B;

Considering its 2022, and we just went through (going through) a pandemic with an easily transferable flu, I can't seem to get annoyed and angry at these types of places for being so cheap that they don't want to get an Eftpos machine.

"A recent post mentioned the long wait times at Rhode Island emergency departments. I've even heard stories of people dying in the waiting room because they was no space, ICU cases held in the ED for lack of beds, people in the ED for so long they actually get well and went home, etc. I know we have medical providers, emergency personnel, hospital employees etc. here so I'm curious about some of the more ridiculous reasons people have been to the ED in your experiences.   


In my younger days I worked as a tech in a hospital in RI. Part of the job was history taking including time of onset so I'll lead with a few examples:

* Infected toe nail. Not a FELON (severe infection)
* A bad dream in which they died and weren't sure if they were actually alive.
* Tired/sore feet from walking.
* A note to take the next day off from work.
* Admitted faking chest pain to skip on DUI charges (they always already booked).
* Insomnia. 
* Rear ended/work accident and attorney stated higher likelihood of a settlement.
* Nose bleed. 
* Coughed twice (pre-COVID).
* On medication from their Dr. but they hadn't gotten fully better after taking the 1st dose.
* Flu after diagnosis at another ED the previous day  but not recovered in 24 hours.
* In a bad mood.   


In many cases people didn't call their Dr, go to alternate locations or came in via 911 because: they were waiting for their shows to be over, they didn't want to drive in and pay to park, they thought they'd seen quicker, they're doctor had a <insert hospital name> on the business card. Bonus outrage for ""but I came by ambulance"" when told they had to wait."|RhodeIsland|2022|True|0

I live in southern Indiana and go to a Norton doctor. Ive been sick for like almost two weeks with a fever. I thought I was improving and was going to go back to work today but last night I had a fever of 102 again.

Anyway I wanted to go see my doctor again today but they don't have an appointment until Tuesday. This is a pattern with them. I need a new doctor's office where I can actually be seen the day of if I'm sick. I don't wanna go to the ER in situations like this because I don't necessarily think it's life threatening and it's really expensive there.

**Hotel San Carlos**

Downtown Phoenix - 202 N Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85004 [**Google Maps Street View**](https://www.google.com/maps/@33.4502494,-112.0738443,3a,75y,323.81h,97.61t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1TNEz2_lgCPJYjR2HFr2lw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1)

[**Check out this album of pictures & articles referenced below.**](https://sli.mg/a/6q3im4) 

There are places around the state that we all know are haunted. The Hotel San Carlos boast of being the only historic boutique hotel in Phoenix, but it's also common knowledge for Valley residents that the place is haunted. But by what exactly? What happened? 

* **History**

The Hotel San Carlos in Downtown Phoenix was built in 1928.  When it was completed it was the tallest building in Phoenix, coming in at a respectable 7 stories tall. However, it would lose the title of tallest skyscraper later that same year with the completion of the Westward Ho. 

[Vintage Hotel San Carlos Image 1 & 2](https://sli.mg/a/6q3im4#M_BzYNEM).

The Hotel San Carlos was built on the same location as the very first school house ever built in Phoenix. The small adobe school was originally constructed in 1874. This was before Phoenix was even incorporated as a city in 1881. During the school's 5 decades of operation, back when the Valley was as wild as any place in the west, it's safe to let your imagination roam as you speculate at the lives, stories, and tragedies that took place within its humble walls. The school was eventually condemned in 1916. Rumors of the Spanish Flu claiming the lives of young children and students at the school. 

Alfred Hitchcock filmed the opening scenes of the masterpiece ""**Psycho**"" (1960) here in Phoenix. As the first shot pans the up-and-coming skyline of the young city, you can clearly see the Hotel San Carlos in it's glory days. [Image 5 and 6](https://sli.mg/a/6q3im4)

Each of the hotel's suites is named and appointed in honor of stars that frequented the hotel during Hollywood's ""Golden Era"". Marilyn Monroe and Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio spent their honeymoon at the hotel in what is now the ""Marilyn Monroe Suite."" This is a crazy bit of trivial, IMHO. 

Each suite is unique; from Mae West and Marilyn Monroe to Ingrid Bergman and Spencer Tracy and lastly the Governor's Suite honoring stars such as Carole Lombard, Jean Harlow, Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant and Gene Autry. [Image 7](https://sli.mg/a/6q3im4)

* **The Ghost of Leone Jensen**

Back in 1928 when the hotel first opened, a young women named Leone Jensen fell to her death from the roof of the 7 story hotel. She was only 22 years old. Some say she was a heart-broken women who took her own life after she lost the love of a young man. The hopeless romantic story we are so familiar with, played out with tragic results. [Image 8](https://sli.mg/a/6q3im4)

Based on what she wrote on her death note, it could be assumed that the 22-year-old woman was physically abused by her boyfriend, a bellboy at the Westward Ho. At this time the Westward Ho was the main competitor of the San Carlos. I'm not claiming this was an inside job, but you know what they say about jet fuel and steel beams. In this case, cold facts can't silence ghost dreams.  

Speculations have been made as to whether Jensen was pregnant and/or her boyfriend was having an affair with another hotel worker. Still others claim that she jumped due to an illness that she had suffered with for many years. Other rumors remain that she was murdered by being pushed to her death, possibly by that same young man, or possibly by her competition vis-a-vis a Roaring 20's Neon Demon situation. It's up to debate. 

On May 7, 1928, The Arizona Republic reported the death of Leone Jensen. The article's headline read ""Leaps Off Roof of Hotel  - Pretty blonde jumps from San Carlos early today"". [ Image 9](https://sli.mg/a/6q3im4)

Now it is said that the ghost of Leone Jensen can be seen roaming the halls, or even standing on the edge of the roof on summer nights. Over the years, there have been innumerable accounts of sightings. I'm told that young men have a particularly high number of sightings. But women have also reported seeing an unfriendly spirit or angry energy. We can all let our imaginations fill in those details. 


* **Ghost of a Young Girl**

Another ghost frequently mentioned by hotel employees is that of a little girl, possibly around six to nine years old, who is rumored to visit hotel rooms at night and has also been seen sitting alone crying by herself. She was possibly one of the area children who attended the old school, or possibly she was affected either by the school's closing or the flu epidemic. 


* **Mystery Death in 2004**

On December 9, 2004, yet another death happened at this hotel, when an ""unidentified man"" jumped to his death from the hotel's roof. I tried researching this, and every reference to this event had it as an 'unidentified man"" which I guess is still a thing in 2004(?) In all likelihood, it's probably another sad case of someone taking their own life. If anyone has information, facts, or rumors regarding  this event, please let me know. I think people's stories deserve to be told. 


* **A Haunted Reunion**

Back in 1998, the Arizona Republic ran an article, ""Hobgoblin Hotel"" about a haunted high school reunion that took place at the Hotel San Carlos that same year. I'd like to mention no one has ever speculated that hobgoblin is responsible for any paranormal activity, but then again the 1990s were a simpler time where we didn't get hung up on official ghost classifications. 

The guests of the reunion reported some strange activity and took some strange photos. [Some of the strange pictures and an interesting account can be seen in this blog post.](http://www.whoa.org/reunions/98phx/ghost.html).

"This is going to be a little long. I recently moved to California temporarily, and one thing that’s blowing my mind is how they have laws in place for employees for minimum wage jobs. 

In California, they require employers to give lunch breaks. In Texas, I have worked 9 hours straight with no break and had to eat my food while standing between orders at Whataburger. I even had to beg to go home when it was finally time. 

California also has paid sick leave; in Texas, I was forced to work while throwing up with the flu because we were low-staffed. I was serving food to people, too. 

It’s entirely legal for Texas businesses to starve and treat their employees less than animals. 

I think it’s so fucking mental that jobs that many people in Texas say are only for “high schoolers and students” are the jobs that take entirely advantage of young kids who don’t know any better. 

So if you have a kid that's about to start working and they refuse to let your kid sit down and eat, remember it's completely legal, and you chose to raise your kids in a state that has no employee protections. Hopefully, y'all change that over there, but now that I've gotten a taste of having protections as an employee, I'm never going back. Crazy how it took working in another state to realize I was being treated less than human because I'm poor and had to work while going to college."|texas|2023|True|0

I felt wiped out after the first days of quarantining but it could have been the flu. Harvard Pilgrim says they wont cover the antibody test unless ordered by a doc.

 However when you try and register at the Clear Choice MD web site after they notify you, you have to choose between paying with insurance or pay 129 plus an unspecified amount to Quest....cant go any farther in the registration process. Then you have to scan in your license.

There is no choice for ""Insurance does not cover""....how do you get the state funded antibody test for no cost? Does the state cover the Quest charge?

"This article breaks down the numbers succinctly:

TLDR:

- It's not just 65+. 40% of people affected are age 20-50. 

- We don't have enough mask, nurses, doctors, beds, ventilators for a moderately bad flu season let alone an infection rate of 1 in 2. 

- Even some recovered people are coming out of this with lung damage and months long recovery

- If we do nothing, there's a potential mortality of 10 million people. 25x US deaths in WW2. 
More than the population of Virginia. 

- This is all about time. Buying as much time as we can to give hospitals time to 'brace for impact'.

"I currently live in the NRV  and Monday I started getting a cough, because of the high risk of exposure at my job I was told to go to the Doctors Tuesday after a sore throat came along for the ride. Sadly my clinic is overwhelmed so they told me to go the ER (LewisGale Blacksburg) over the phone, when I get there they did a strep test and that’s it. The test came up negative so they believe it’s just a cold and move me along.

My job has the policy during this situation that I must be without symptoms for 72 hours without any medication, or a doctors note. I had to take Robitussin since than to deal with the dry cough and sore throat which has now turned into a more substance based cough so my only bet was the ER again since my Doctor still can’t see me. This time around they were more cautious, going to the length of talking to me over the phone while in the room except to just check my heart and lungs which were done under extremely protective gear. The doctor didn’t understand why they didn’t do a flu test immediately on Tuesday but that test also came up negative and since I’m not in respiratory distress they won’t be doing a COVID-19 test. They said by Day 7 or 8 the virus will get worse, so by Monday if I’m better it’s a cold and I can return to work March 25th, if it gets worse than I have COVID-19 and need to stay quarantined till mid April.

Does Anyone have info on this year's flu/ stomach flu around Indy?

 Sons daycare has been hit with flu symptoms that seem to be severe for about 12 hours and then gone, no fever. Daughters school has also been hit (against small window, no fever). 

Now my wife has it, no fever, just puking. Almost like a food poisoning or ""stomach flu"".

Symptoms appear to literally be just puke, then gone. No body aches, no sniffles. No temp. No bathroom issues, just vomit it seems and maybe tiredness.

"Hello fellow CT residents.

There is a sub group of us living amounts you in CT (and the country) that REALLY really need your help, urgently.

This isn't acknowledged much but when Trump gave full immunity to the Covid vaccine manufactures, he simultaneously cut the American people out the the VICP program protection. 

All vaccines in America are covered under VICP (Vaccine injury compensation program)...EXCEPT the covid vaccines are excluded. 

When you see these rare scenarios of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, blot clots, children with myocarditis. For the first time in modern history, you are now on your own. Medical and financial help is not available to you. However, under VICP, flu shots, HPV, tetanus, etc all covered....but not covid shots.

Seriously, Tell me how this makes ANY SENSE!

&#x200B;

This is an absolutely outrageous loophole and needs to be fixed immediately. These shots should be treated the same as all other vaccines. 

&#x200B;

There is a bill that would add covid vaccines to VICP the same as all other vaccines, and needs to be co-sponsored by a Democratic Senator next week by 3/7/22. They are trying to include it in the upcoming pandemic package 3/8/22

Please reach out to CT Senators Murphy and Blumenthal immediately to co sponsor a bill by Senator Mike Lee of Utah. I am told Mike Lee's staffer Ryan Neuhaus can be contacted.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to write this in a way where it doesn't look like one of those shit spam posts but let me recap for you:

When you get a proven injury from any vaccine (rare) the government has a program in place to help you...but when its the covid vaccine trump set it up where government just tell you to go fuck off. We are not even allowed to talk about this without getting deleted because the very acknowledgment of this gets attacked.

&#x200B;

This should NOT be a  partisan issue. This should have NEVER been allowed to happen. Trump made us a shit deal.

Seriously i'm tired of hearing the left right bullshit. There is no excuse to single this shot out and exclude it from medical and financial help. This was a huge mistake and needs to be fixed ASAP.

If you think its not affecting people it...it is. There are many of us injured in CT and we are losing our homes now. Disabled and totally fucked by this loophole. Do you know what IVIG costs? shit is like $10,000 a day and I'm stuck on this shit for life now with CIDP and numb limbs... If this happened to me from the flu shot (it also happens) I would have protection. This makes no sense.

Please reach out to the CT senators and ask them to co-sign the bill with Mike Lee adding the covid vaccines to VICP, its the right thing to do and should never have been slid through like this."|Connecticut|2022|True|0
"There was a previous post with a tweet from a greens member about changes to tenancy laws. The regulation was released late Friday, um surprise. 

Here is what I can gather (I'm not a lawyer or even mildly competent):

* Notice to leave if premises being sold [section 35](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sec.35). You get 2 months notice. Previously this only applied to month to month tenancies and even then you [had to have a sale contract](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2008-073#sec.286). Now it can be if ""the lessor is preparing to sell"".
* Notice to leave if the owner or one of their family members want to move in [section 36](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sec.37). I can't find if this was a thing before or not. 2 months notice.
* They can still [inspect](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sec.17) you/your undies, show people through etc, unless: You/them are under a public health order to quarantine. Or you are over 70 or (65 and have health conditions), atsi over 50, have immune system complications. Ie. You are a [vulnerable](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sch.1) person.
* [Hardship](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sec.6) is :
   * when you have the covid19 disease, you have been given a quarantine directive, you employment is closed because of a public health direction (directly or indirectly) or you are a [vulnerable](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sch.1) person.
   * In addition to the above you also need: your income has reduced > 25% or > 30% of your income is rent.
* You can be evicted for any regular reason, except, you can't be evicted if the reason is unpaid rent payment and you [fall into the hardship category above](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sec.8). The restrictions ends Sept 29 (but could be earlier if the bat flu emergency is lifted).
* If your fixed agreement runs out you can get an [extension up to Sept 30](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/sl-2020-0057#sec.9), have to fall into the hardship definition again.

# What else could possibly go wrong?

The Trump Administration’s response to the covid-19 pandemic has been a series of calamities proving Murphy’s Law: whatever can go wrong will. This started with the [dismissal of the seriousness of the pandemic ](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/09/us/trump-vs-biden/trump-acknowledges-report-that-he-played-down-the-threat-of-the-coronavirus-calling-himself-a-cheerleader)from January 2020 through March 2020. The White House dismissed the need for a national plan, leaving the states to fend for themselves. This led to an explosion of cases, severe shortages of PPE, and hundreds of thousands of deaths. By April, the economy was shut down. Meanwhile, Trump was criticizing public health officials, both nationally and in the states.

By June, the virus was exploding in the Southeast and Midwest, just weeks after the economy started reopening. More than ten Midwestern states did not issue stay at home orders. Saving the economy outweighed public health concerns. When to reopen the schools became the next issue to divide the country.

By July, the USA led the world in infections and deaths. Once again herd immunity was considered as a policy, protecting the vulnerable and allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled. Trump and other administrative officials continued to downplay the utility of facial masks and social distancing despite the objections of public health officials and the clear science regarding the use of masks.

In September, the FDA announced it would consider emergency approval of an experimental vaccine by November 1. Drug companies start phase 3 trials involving up to 30,00 volunteers. **But** only half are enrolled by September 1.

It usually takes 3 months to start up phase 3 trials and at least 6 – 9 months to collect and analyze data. Data on phase 1 and phase 2 trials have not been published and peer reviewed. Initial reports of the experimental vaccines includes side affects such as fever, muscle pain and headaches.

Unsurprisingly, Trump has promoted the approval of a vaccine by Election Day.

There are two basic methods for developing vaccines. The traditional method involves growing large amounts, disabling the virus and using it to warn the immune system. But this process can take years. The second method, using mRNA, is new and experimental.

The experimental vaccines are based on gene editing techniques that are unstable. mRNA stands for Messenger Ribonucleic Acid. RNA regulates cellular processes related to DNA, Deoxyribonucleic Acid.

The process takes a snip of the Covid RNA and embeds it in a coronavirus that is both rare and has minimal infection impact. Being unstable, it must be kept at -100 degrees F, too high for liquid nitrogen and too low for conventional refrigerators. That means expensive refrigeration must be developed to transport and distribute the vaccine.

**THE QUESTION IS**: Will the vaccine be effective and for how long?

The plan is to make the vaccine available to the vulnerable and front line providers, such as hospital workers, police, firemen, EMTs, etc.

But he vulnerable — aged, people of color and those with underlying conditions — are not well represented in the trial population and the impact of the vaccine may not be as planned. What if the front line providers have reactions to the vaccine and are unable to work, or if the effect of the vaccine is limited and they believe they are protected but they are not?

Also, given the administration’s record of denial and disinformation, what segment of the public will trust that the vaccine is safe and effective?

Nine drug companies competing to be the first to develop a coronavirus vaccine have [issued a pledge](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/health/9-drug-companies-pledge-coronavirus-vaccine.html) that they would “stand with science” and not release a vaccine until it was proven to be safe and effective.

This is especially important in light of the [halt of the Phase 3 trial ](https://www.axios.com/astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-study-pause-22983f19-a88a-48d7-b613-d5418ada3b81.html)by AstraZeneca because of adverse reactions in one patient. AstraZeneca is working on what is reported to be the most promising of the vaccine candidates. This is standard procedure for an event like this, allowing an investigation into the event.

The big question for the future is this: What if Trump uses the Defense Production Act to overrule the drug companies and release a vaccine that has not been proven safe or effective?

# Sturgis Rally – a superspreader event?

You may have heard about the [new study](https://cheps.sdsu.edu/docs/Contagion_Externality_Sturgis_Motorcycle_Rally_9-5-20_Dave_et_al.pdf) out that claims that the Sturgis rally is linked to 250,000 covid-19 cases around the country, with an estimated cost of around $12 billion. As tempting as it is, I’m not going to comment on this, because it has not been peer reviewed and I’m not an epidemiologist. It’s something worth watching, though, especially since there are a few religious “leaders” in SoCal who seem intent on holding superspreader events of their own.

"Help needed, please. 

Long story short, I bought a British car in the early 90s, drove it for about 4 years and bought a grown up Honda. The car has sat at my parent’s property since then. I moved away and back a few years ago. 

In that time my father “sold” the car to a guy who wanted to fix it up. He never took possession of it but did get the title. He got sick and “sold” it back to me about 5 years ago but we never got the title (he died 2 weeks after). His brother, the executor, had no knowledge of the transaction and no documentation and the estate has been settled since 2018. 

Now I want to restore it but we are in title limbo. It is still sitting on my parents property a barn. 

I spoke with a DOT officer who said that there is nothing we can do which makes no sense: it’s an abandoned car on my parents property. 

Should I have it declared abandoned and “buy” it from my parents for $1 after 30 days? Has anyone had any experience in this area?"|NorthCarolina|2022|True|0

Found a place in wilson but their schools seem shitty. 

I thought Raleigh would be nice but most of the schools have low scores according to zillow. Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: thankbyou everyone this was very helpful. One last question if anyone is still reading this, according to zillow it looks like nearly every home in the suggested areas(cary, apex...) has HOA, is that true?"|NorthCarolina|2022|True|0

Now though, when I asked for a paystub and explanationto make sure I'd be getting the ESST hours, my manager said that I wouldn't receive them, due to quitting.

"I own a 2022 Chevrolet BOLT EUV Launch Edition. This car is loaded to the max. Has every possible option including Super Cruise. A little over a year after owning it, I tried to trade it towards a $5,000 car because my situation had changed, and I didn't want a car payment. That is when I found out that its value had dropped by nearly 1/2 !!!

The Salesman told me I would need to take out an $18,000 dollar loan to cover the difference. And that he could only offer me $19,500 for a car I just paid $40K for 14 months prior! I couldn't F-n believe it, I felt like it was a joke. But it wasn't. Every dealer I talked to said the same thing.

Now it's time to renew my tabs and Minnesota says its worth $38,000. And wants me to pay $506.25 to license it! Ha! I can't believe it... I'm being robbed again!!! I literally just double checked, and KBB Values it at $19,500 Private Party sale in (2% of cases) excellent condition.

Where does Minnesota get their values from? Because I'd like it if the dealers would use the same source.

Can I appeal what Minnesota has for a value?



Side Note:

I contacted GM after going to a few dealers (one who literally said they didn't want to take it in on trade). And fought with them for over a month trying to get them to buy it back or cover the difference of a normal cars depreciation rate when trading it in. They obviously refused. I am sick to my stomach, and beyond livid with GM over this situation. It's the first car I ever purchased new. And it's been the worst experience of my life!

And as far as EV's go... Worst Decision EVER. My electric bill DOUBLED from $250/mo. to $500+ when charging as much as I needed. Now I have to ration my charging, look for cheap charging stations. Not use my car (That I pay for and can't get out from under) and use my Girlfriends to go to work instead.

I Hate it, I HATE General Motors and now Minnesota wants to screw me as well. But hey at least I’m saving the environment... NOT.

"Hello! 

I work in MN (And the company is based here) and my company has recently started deducting from our PTO if we are late to clock in. At all. Ex: if I was scheduled at 2p and clocked in at 2:03, they will automatically deduct 3 minutes from my PTO balance.  Similarly, if you're sick and call out, even if approved by your boss, that day will automatically be taken from your PTO.  Many of my coworkers like to save up PTO for vacations, and this policy is throwing a wrench in those plans. 

Does anyone know if this is a legal practice? I thought part of PTO is that the worker can choose when to use it, but I've never had a company try to do this.

Hello all - long time /r/sydney shitposter, first time /r/sydney event host.

I haven't been to Frankie's in a long time - in fact, the last time I went was a few years ago as part of a /r/sydney meetup hosted by /u/tinmun. Following on from him and old timer ~~/u/Roguey~~/u/Rougey, I feel like it's time to give it a crack and do something myself. Also I wanted an excuse to drink and socialize with new people.

******

**DATE:**  Friday 23 April 2021

**TIME:**  From 4pm onwards (Happy Hour is 4-6pm)

**LOCATION:**  [Frankies](https://www.frankiespizzabytheslice.com/)  (50 Hunter Street) - closest stations are Wynyard and Martin Place.

**PLAN:** Happy Hour drinks at Frankies then who knows...

******

**Slightly edited FAQ (stolen from tinmun)**

**Q:**  What can I get for cheap during Happy Hour at Frankie's?

**A:**   Delicious pizza slices, nice beers (no VB, Carlton, or others, just good stuff!), wines and more. Best to ask the bar staff what is exactly part of the happy hour though so you don't pay full price accidentally. A popular /r/sydney go-to is whiskey with freshly squeezed apple juice.

**Q:**  Why should I go?

**A:**  This is an awesome pub, and this deal is absolutely the best that I've seen in Sydney. I mean, it's ~~_three dollars_~~ _four dollars fifty cents_  for drinks or pizza in an awesome place! 
Also you can meet some new awesome people along the way.

**Q:**  OK, but do they have pinball machines there?

**A:**  Of course!, AC/DC, Metallica, and many others! Not sure of the cost since I personally don't participate in the pinball debauchery aspect of Frankie's.

**Q:**  Can I go?

**A:**  Yes. Unless you're sick and/or unwell. Then do us a favour and not ruin it for the rest of us by staying home (there's always next time).

Since I knock off early on Friday's, I'll be there when the place opens. If you're lost, I'll be the Asian guy with long hair, glasses, a white/cream coloured hoodie and a beard with most likely a beer in hand.

"Dunno if anyone else is suffering a massive influx of German Roaches at the moment, but wondering if anyone has any tips/treatments...

For context: I live in a 1st floor apartment but haven’t had this big a problem since I moved in 3 years ago (mainly just get the seasonal big fatties that my cats keep to a minimum). One of my exes had a major problem in a large apartment complex, and he ended up having to live with it, so I know its pretty normal, but I’m fucking pissed given I lost my microwave to the bastards on Thursday - nested in there and fucked the wiring up. And tbh, kinda sick of having to clean all my cookware and crockery before every use bc it kinda defeats the purpose of washing up to begin with.

I’ve tried some way-out essential oil concoctions (from leftover vape juice concentrates) which only seem to work as a point-and-shoot killer. I’ve got some standard Mortein roach baits around the place that only worked for the first 2 or 3 weeks - the bastards have gained a tolerance by the looks. I have a can of point-and-shoot spray, but I’m highly allergic and really prefer not to use it after waking up unable to see/breathe properly the next day...

The other critical factors here are: I have cats and a good ecosystem of spiders that I’m trying to keep around to control flying bugs/for genuine Entomology research (long story, don’t ask). So I don’t want to poison the fuck out of my pets (vertebrate and invertebrate)

So, given all of that, has anyone got any suggestions for low/no-allergen roach controls? I’m aware my high standards make it that much more difficult to remedy, but any advice is welcome.

"I am in Year 10 currently and I am hoping to apply and gain acceptance into a Sydney selective school, with my goal set for Caringbah High School.

This is mostly is because my best and my most prioritised friendships are in selective schools, and frankly, I'm sick of the culture at my Catholic school.

My grades are pretty good, with my Year 9 yearly report being mostly As with a couple Bs and one C, achieving As in all core, although my upcoming half yearly might not be as promising as I'm really unhappy at school and only really bothering with maths because that's the only class I feel challenged by and enough to care about.

My friends say it's super hard to get into selective schools, and my grades might not be super for half yearly, but my strong suit is my IQ, always achieving 95th-99th percentile for IQ.

Would I be best suited for selective schooling? Even though I may not be as 'try-hard' or well rounded as my peers?"|sydney|2021|True|0

1) reduce number of feeders  
2) use feeder types which don't allow birds to congregate  
3) put less food out at a time and clean between refills  
4) sweep up underneath - I built a paver patio underneath my feeders which makes that much easier   
5) remove bird baths - I have a waterfall feature in the yard so that will be the water source.

"According to one group, MN is one of the least free states.  I think we value and have freedom in many ways.  We were the only state to vote down marriage discrimination and voter ID.

 This year we gained legal cannabis with home grow, right to repair law, sick and family leave at work, and school meals, which help students' health and learning for a better chance at success and pursuit of happiness.

Yes, this all costs taxes, but we have a property tax refund which is unique and helps middle and lower income folks, the highest median household income in the region and we do well in many quality of life measures.

"Animal control officials in Burnsville, Minn., say they’ve seen an “unusual number” of reports of raccoons that are sick or acting strangely in recent months.

In a news release this week, the city said its Animal Control staff has received 39 such reports since July — compared to just 17 in 2022.

“These raccoons have been observed to be staggering, experiencing seizures, unafraid of their surroundings and allowing people to approach them, or laying/slumped for an extended period of time,” the city reported.

The reports have been “widely spread” across the southern Twin Cities suburb.

“Two raccoons were recently taken to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Clinic. One animal tested positive for distemper and salmonellosis. The test results for the second raccoon were uncertain but the raccoon may have died from salmonellosis,” the city reported.

As a general rule, authorities said, people should stay away from raccoons or any other wildlife they may encounter. But if Burnsville residents see a raccoon that does not show fear of people or other animals, or displays other abnormal behavior, they should call the city’s Animal Control staff at (952) 894-3647.

I’ve been struggling my entire life with what I wanted my career to be, I never had any direction or much good sense as a kid, which led me to a life of trouble, drugs, and eventually prison (two separate trips) and 7 felony convictions in Texas. I just realized that there is a HUGE need to help house the homeless and needy that are stuck out in the cold, and all they want is a warm, safe place to get back on their feet. Don’t get it confused, I’m not talking about a “wet” shelter that allows people to go out and abuse drugs all day and come back to a free roof. I know of a few non profits that have strict rules, and you aren’t allowed to drink or use drugs, if you’re caught in any way then they kick you out. Violence and threats of violence will not be tolerated either. I digress, my point is, I’m 36 years old now and I feel my calling in life (now that I’m clean and sober for 4 years) is to start a non profit to help house the less fortunate in either Vermont or New Hampshire. I have an entire lifetime of dealing with this type of lifestyle and this particular niche group of individuals. I have been homeless due to drug addiction and lack of desire to work, and also homeless again due to a divorce and the ex wife taking everything. Being married and sober for several years and being a step father taught me a lot. When she left me suddenly and silently, I knew then that I would probably either go back to drugs, or just become a shell of a person and have no desire to live due to lack of purpose, which would eventually send me back out into the cold without direction or guidance. I have a history of PTSD in my past and it affected me for many many years. I still deal with it, but I cope much better and I don’t have panic attacks like I used to. Anyways, what I’m getting at is that I know that just because you’re homeless does NOT mean you are necessarily on or abusing drugs. I lost my house, my car, 95% of my belongings, and had nothing but a hiking backpack, snow boots, 4 pairs of clothes, and the herpes virus she was gracious enough to leave me with too. I lost my marbles for about a year, ended up back on the streets or in psychiatric hospitals. Cost of living and rent in both states are so ridiculously high that there are more and more people becoming homeless without any underlying addictions or issues, other than lack of financial stability and rising costs of living. I would absolutely love it if someone who’s been in the 501c3 market and has experience with securing grants and financing, I already have a non profit model “incorporated” and on paper. I even know a perfect location in Vermont where it’s populous, but there’s no shelter. Any type of input or feedback would be greatly appreciated. We’re all humans, we all fall on hard times eventually in life, some worse than others. But homelessness doesn’t make you any less human nor does having an addiction. There’s root causes and trauma that are the main root of addiction, and the world is lacking compassion for each other nowadays. My heart just wants to help so badly to give homeless people who have a desire to set aside a plan and goals to get back on their feet a warm and safe place to sleep, and a good meal. I want to see the community thrive. I have first hand experience in the client area of non profits, and have developed friendships with 2 people who did HR for a shelter in VT. I am no longer in contact with them, because they are not being good stewards of the money they’re receiving, and I’m confident that they will be exposed one day. It was a very unfair and unacceptable environment for addicts. They condoned and enabled clients to smoke weed on property, smoke crack, come in drunk, etc. you could come and go and you please, and if they liked you, they played favorites and still to this day do not truly live by their mission statement. I also have first hand experience in this situation because I lived there for 8 months, fresh from Texas, all the way up to Vermont. They didn’t like outsiders, but I am good with people. I became a favorite and would sit back and watch HIPPA laws being violated, clients being shown major favoritism over others who they would kick out as soon as they found an excuse, and the HR manager (the guy mentioned earlier) was conversing with me via phone and text after I was placed on the DNA (do not admit) list. Fast forward a couple of months and a shelter worker reached out to me via text (she’d gotten my number from my intake paperwork before it was shredded) and she asked me how I was doing-she genuinely meant it. Fast forward another 2 months, the HR dept. and executives found out she had contacted me and they fired her on those grounds. I’m not a lawyer, but is anyone else reading this and thinking “wow, people use non profits to their personal advantage for monetary gain, and work at these places because they feel they are invincible to the law they randomly decided to write all of the sudden?” They cut corners everywhere after receiving funding allocated specifically for a purpose, but they only pocket it. Even their public tax documents are sketchy. Anyways , I’ve ranted and digressed so much that I’ve gone off topic. My point is- I need help. Suggestions, laws and rules that are in place surrounding grants, securing funding, etc. I have an excellent mission statement and community purpose that can and desperately needs to be fulfilled. Please give me any feedback you can. Constructive Criticism is welcome too. I just need more knowledge. And one person alone can’t start and run a non profit. Thanks for reading.|Vermont|2024|True|0

**Increased Patient Volumes in Emergency Departments Straining Vermont Health Care Systems**

Respiratory viral activity and nirsevimab update

**BACKGROUND**

A surge of  respiratory illness is straining health care systems across Vermont. To  help reduce this burden, clinicians can encourage patients to remain up  to date on vaccinations, test and treat for respiratory  illnesses appropriately, and remind patients to avoid others when sick.

In Vermont,  significantly increased activity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),  along with co-circulation of influenza virus, rhinovirus, COVID-19, and  other respiratory viruses, is causing a high incidence  of respiratory illness. This surge of illness is straining health care  systems across the region, causing bed shortages, staffing shortages,  and long wait times for medical care.  Long wait times in Emergency  Departments have been attributed to high patient  volumes in inpatient settings, both in hospital inpatient settings and  in long-term care and behavioral health facility types.

**REQUESTED ACTIONS**

**Providers and Healthcare Facilities**

Primary  Care Practices and Urgent Care Centers should consider communicating  availability of office hours outside of normal business hours (extended  hours and weekend hours for sick  visits) to patients and provide information related to the types of  injuries and illnesses appropriate for primary care or urgent care, , as  alternatives to an Emergency Department visit.

Long  Term Care Facilities or Congregate Living Facilities who have access to  in-house medical care should prioritize on-site medical care whenever  available and indicated. If on-site  care is not available, consider Primary Care Practices and then Urgent  Care Centers, before Emergency Department Level of Care.

Consider  the use of Telehealth as a resource for patients who may be effectively  seen in a virtual setting and when in-person options are not available  or necessary. Telehealth may  also be available for physician consult in some cases.

**Vaccinations**

All eligible Vermonters should stay up to date on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations.

&#x200B;

* Walk-in clinics remain available, with expanded weekend and evening hours to accommodate a variety of schedules, namely  families with school-aged children. 
* Everyone 6 months and older is recommended to receive an annual influenza vaccine. 
* Everyone  5 years and older who has gotten their primary COVID-19 vaccination  series is recommended to receive the COVID-19  bivalent Omicron booster. These booster shots are widely available, and  studies indicate that they are highly effective against currently  circulating Omicron variants. 
* Given  the recent increase in nirsevimab supply and the manufacturers’ plan to  release an additional 230,000 doses in  January, CDC advises healthcare providers to return to recommendations  put forward by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  (ACIP) on use of nirsevimab in young children. Infants and children  recommended to receive nirsevimab should be immunized  as quickly as possible. RSV activity remains elevated nationwide and is  increasing in parts of the country.

&#x200B;

* &#x200B;
   * All infants aged less than 8 months and children aged 8 through 19 months at increased risk of respiratory syncytial  virus (RSV), are recommended to receive a single dose of nirsevimab. 
   * Pregnant  people 32 through 36 weeks gestation should receive RSV vaccination  through January. Pfizer Abrysvo  is the only vaccine recommended for use in pregnant people.  Administration of both nirsevimab and RSV vaccination for pregnant  people is not needed to protect most infants.

**Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions**

Staying home while sick, masking and other measures can help keep others safe.

&#x200B;

* All persons with acute respiratory symptoms should stay home while ill, especially students and those who work in health  care, child care or long-term care, even if they have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies. 
* All persons with respiratory symptoms should wear a mask and practice social distancing when around others.
* People may consider masking and social distancing when around young children or medically-vulnerable people. 
* All persons should cover their mouth using a tissue or bent arm—not their hand—when they cough or sneeze and should  wash their hands frequently throughout the day.
* Infants  under the age of 6 months are most at risk for severe RSV disease.  Families of young infants should be counseled  to practice good hand hygiene. Types of contact that increase the risk  of RSV transmission to infants include holding, kissing or touching the  hands or face of an infant. These types of contact should be limited to  essential caregivers as much as possible  during RSV season."|Vermont|2024|True|0

### Ada and the Lost Horizon

A choose-your-own-adventure-style game where the only limits on choice are your own imagination; a scavenger hunt within the confines of your own home; a real-world Ready Player One experience; and a community-oriented coronavirus quarantine activity that takes you on an imaginary journey to another world -- while taking you on a physical journey away from your computer screen.
 
The premise: A young woman named Ada wakes to find herself alone. She was supposed to be here with her younger brother, Teddy. She was supposed to be watching out for him. But Teddy has disappeared in the night. Ada must find him, but her only clue is a ransom note. What the ransom note says, where it leads her, and if and how she ever manages to see her brother again… that's completely up to the player.
 
Every other day, the next scene in Ada’s quest will be posted to Twitter and Instagram, along with a task for participants to complete. How you choose to complete the task will determine the course of the rest of the story.

### The History and Cosmology of LSD With Hamilton Morris and Chris Bache Ph.D

Join the Brooklyn Psychedelic Society this Bicycle Day for two in-depth discussions and Q+A with Christopher Bache, Ph.D, author of LSD and the Mind of the Universe and Hamilton Morris, chemist, writer, and host of Hamilton's Pharmacopeia on VICE.  
 
In his book LSD and the Mind of the Universe, religious studies professor Chris Bache chronicled his 73 high-dose LSD sessions that were carefully designed to follow the protocols established by Stan Grof, the historic LSD psychiatrist and researcher. While LSD is frequently touted for its psychological and therapeutic benefits, Chris's careful pursuit of LSD as a catalyst for spiritual insight is a path only a handful have publicly talked about.
 
Hamilton Morris is a chemist, writer, host of Hamilton's Pharmacopeia on VICE, and a walking and talking wikipedia with footnotes when it comes to psychedelic science and history. We'll be talking about the scientific and cultural history of LSD, with some assured detours into hopefully adjacent topics. 
 
Our interview with Chris will start at 3p. Our interview with Hamilton will start at 6p. Each talk will be followed up with a live Q and A from the audience.

Okay, so not officially but I feel like this would be a good idea. Also, the last time I went there I got MASSIVELY sea-sick (so embarrassing, I was on a first date, I swear they were manually creating turbulence because the river was calm as can be......!)|NewYorkCity|2020|True|0
"Okay, so three weeks ago, I wrote a [post about how to prepare](https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/fcbcem/covid19_coronavirus_preparedness_announcement/) just in case the situation with SARS-CoV-2 and Covid 19 gets serious here. 


**Okay, so where are we now?**

As of the time of writing, nonessential businesses are shuttered, gatherings have been banned, and most of the country (NY included) is ordering people to stay inside except for essential reasons (groceries, medical care, etc.) In fact, the federal government recommends that all US citizens stay at home for at least the weeks of April 6 and 13 in a desperate attempt to reduce disease transmission. 

Our morgues have filled up, refrigerated trucks are filled with the deceased, and there are talks of temporary burials in public parks for those currently dying.

So I think it’s safe to say that things are serious now. But that doesn't mean it's too late for your actions to matter. Our next few weeks are going to be bad. That's undeniable. But it could be a lot worse, and how bad it gets will depend on you and your actions. 

You heard that right. 

**The first and foremost concern facing NYC right now is flooding the medical system**—filling up ICU beds and using ventilators until there aren’t any left, and doctors are left to choose which patients to try and save with the limited equipment they have, which is what has happened in Italy. 

*What can YOU do to help?*

Stay home. If you keep yourself as isolated as possible, limit nonessential trips outside your place, and avoid contact with others at all costs, you are less likely to get sick. And less likely to be competing for a non-existent ICU bed with thousands of other patients.

And remember, it’s not just about you. Even if you’re young and healthy and in a low-risk group, even if you don’t think getting it will be a big deal for you, it is a big deal for the doctors and nurses and hospital staff that are risking their lives to treat you (without adequate PPE for that matter!)

And it’s a big deal for the people who will contract it from you because you went out before you knew you had anything and touched the same door handle that you did. Remember, even if you are feeling fine, that doesn’t mean you aren’t an asymptomatic carrier. You can still get others sick, just by coming into contact with them.

**Another concern facing NYC right now is resource distribution.** 

Right now the city is divided between people who can work from home, people who lost their jobs and have no income, and people who cannot work from home and are still going to work, often for essential jobs like medicine, pharmacy, distribution, and food services.

*What can YOU do to help?* 

If you are in a position where you have enough money or cash flow to help your vulnerable neighbors, especially the elderly, immunocompromised, and those who have lost their jobs, do it. Ask if there are any necessities you can pick up or order or pick up for them. Shelf-stable food, diapers, baby formula, feminine supplies, cleaning supplies, etc. Share your wifi password if they don’t have access.

Keep in mind—the delivery apps that most young people are familiar with can often be confusing and difficult for the elderly. If you can, help your elderly neighbors set up food, prescription, and other essential delivery by either ordering for them or helping them learn to use the apps (keeping a safe distance, of course).

You can also organize a list for your building, where you collect the info of people who are willing to chip in to help and people who are vulnerable and need help. Coordinate with others who are financially able to help, and make sure that your neighbors aren’t starving while you continue to take home an ample paycheck. 

You should also do this without the expectation of repayment, if at all possible. Be human. 

The city is currently offering [3 free meals/day for anyone who shows up](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/food/free-meals). If an immunocompromised neighbor or someone with limited mobility needs access to that program, consider picking up food for them. 

* What else can you do to help? 

**Consider what you can do to reduce your burden on the system.**

First of all, when you buy stuff, don’t re-sell it at a profit. I don’t care how desperate you are, profiting off of a crisis is a shitty thing to do. 

At this point, people are going without because people are making a run on the stores and buying enough for several months. The time for that was before the virus hit, as I urged people to do over a month ago in my first post. At this point, we need to keep things stable. Buy only what you need so that there is enough for everyone. And consider if you are buying a specialty product, that there are other people who may need that product more than you. 

For example, you might be out of TP. But don’t switch to baby wipes, because there are plenty of parents who actually need to use them for their intended purpose (cleaning babies). 

Don’t buy up more medicines and cleaning products than you reasonably need. It sucks when you find out that your relative who needs regular insulin injections can’t buy rubbing alcohol to clean their injection site because there isn’t any alcohol left in the stores.

**Think if there is a way for you to contribute something to others.**

For example, if you are a pet person, many animal shelters are experiencing strain right now with fewer volunteers to take care of their dogs and cats. Consider fostering or adopting.

If you have extra PPE or medical supplies, donate them to a hospital please. Doctors in Brooklyn are already wearing the same mask for days at a time. I promise, doctors need it more than you do. 

Consider doing something to help brighten things for others. Write an encouraging message on your window (backwards, so people outside can read it!) Plant tulips in your window. Share positive and encouraging things on social media. 

**Go back to sustainable basics—many of the things we consider essential now weren’t even around 50 years ago.**

This includes luxuries, even using a washing machine. See this [guide on how to do your laundry in your tub](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fmml5j/a_new_yorkers_guide_to_doing_your_damn_laundry_in/) for info on how to avoid a shared laundry room or Laundromat. 

Think about how your grandparents lived, and what they considered important and essential. There are detailed instructions online about how to DIY a bunch of things we take for granted, and tons of information about the way people used to live.

If you read about WWI and WWII, there was a big push for people to do their own vegetable gardening so that food could be sent to soldiers abroad. They were called Victory Gardens, or War Gardens. It’s not always practical in a NYC apartment, but there are lots of tutorials online for vertical gardening that you can use to grow tomatoes and other fruits and veggies inside or on a balcony. Plus, it will give you something to do while stuck inside! 

And also, do you think that people always had toilet paper? Now, I’m not saying to go gather leaves and pinecones or anything, but getting a peri-bottle and then hopping in the shower or wiping with a washable rag (and then washing it, please! Don't flush!) does the job if necessary. Or get a bidet (assuming you still can), as I mentioned in my first post. Just don't flush fabric that you used to wipe, as an unfortunate neighborhood in California recently found out, when they experienced a large sewer blockage due to people flushing fabric scraps.

For most of human history, babies were cloth-diapered, and cloth wipes were used. If you can’t get the disposable diapers you would usually use for your kid, you can either buy or make cloth diapers using online tutorials and fabric you already have. 

Don’t let things to to waste. Use the fresh food you have before it goes bad, and come up with new and creative ways to combine your food that would otherwise end up in the trash. Make freezer meals if you make too much to eat at once. 


**Be mindful your mental health, and the mental health of others.**

Here is the [CDC’s page on stress and coping, which has good resources.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html) 

This kind of situation is enough to make just about anyone depressed, stressed out, and anxious. And it’s perfectly normal to feel that way! Reach out to people who can support you, and try and be a reliable shoulder for others to lean on (with a 6ft+ distance of course). 

Routines are important. Build a routine with in-home exercise (which is proven to help with anxiety and depression!), using online videos as a guide. Give yourself tasks to do. If the news is making you more anxious, turn it off. Take up painting, drawing, or writing. Keep in contact with others through social media. Learn a new subject or language that you’ve always been interested in. And make yourself follow your routine, even if you don’t want to.

If you are living with others, do what you can to keep the peace. Recent numbers in countries across the globe show that both the incidence of domestic violence and the incidence of divorce are going up significantly during quarantine. Remember that you and your family are a team, and you’re in this together. Don’t go to war against each other. Let the little things slide. And especially don’t hit people. Seriously. 

Remember that kids especially are going to have a hard time with this. They don’t have the framework and coping mechanisms that adults do. It’s hard enough to have seen this coming and been mentally preparing yourself since January when we started seeing the news out of China. It’s another thing entirely to have been playing with your friends in school one week and then find yourself locked inside for the foreseeable future the next week. Kids don’t react to stress the way adults do, either. They may experience behavior regression, act irrational, or just more difficult and needy. That’s a normal and natural response, and it’s important to be patient during this time. Getting angry at them over something that isn’t in their control (even if you feel it is) isn’t going to help anyone. 

I’ll be adding more to this as I think of more to write.

But in the meantime, stay safe and stay healthy, New York! We can do this!"|NewYorkCity|2020|True|0
"> On March 20, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State will be going under PAUSE. The policy, which stands for Policies that Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone, places more restrictions on the entire state population, with different regulations for vulnerable and non-vulnerable populations.
> 
> Vulnerable populations cover those who are 70 and older, and those who have compromised immune systems. Provisions for the vulnerable populations, which Cuomo has called “Matlida’s Law,” include remaining indoors, but allows for outdoor solitary exercise. All visitors must be pre-screened by taking their temperature and the vulnerable population cannot go visit households with multiple people. Vulnerable persons should wear mask in company of others, and everyone in presence of vulnerable should wear mask. Finally, all vulnerable individuals must stay at least 6 feet from individuals and should not take public transit unless it’s urgent or necessary.
> 
> For the non-vulnerable population, all non-essential gatherings have been cancelled, and any concentration of individuals outside home prohibited unless essential. Individuals should also limit outdoor recreational activities to non-contact as well as limiting their use of public transportation unless absolutely necessary. Sick individuals unless they are going to receive medical care.
> 
> Finally, all non-vulnerable populations must continue to practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from others, and businesses that are essential must implement rules to make this possible.
> 
> These new provisions will take effect on Sunday. Additionally, all nonessential businesses will have 100% of their workforce stay home. 
> 
> “This is the most drastic action we can take,” said Governor Cuomo. “These provisions will be enforced. These are legal provisions. There will be civil fines and mandatory closures for businesses that do not comply.”
> 
> However, Cuomo held firm that this new plan is not a shelter-in-place order.
> 
> “It’s not a shelter-in-place order,” said Cuomo. “People are scared and people panic. Why am I increasing the mandates? Because the numbers are increasing. I said from day one, this is science and math. Watch the trajectory – you have the density control valve. If the numbers starts to go up, tighten the valve. If the number doesn’t slow down, tighten the valve more. If the number doesn’t go down, close the valve. We’re closing the valve.”
> 
> At the time of the conference, New York State has 7,102 cases of coronavirus, with 1,255 people hospitalized and 35 deaths. 32,427 people have been tested so far. New York City has the most cases in the state with 4,408 cases.
> 
> During the press conference, Cuomo stated that the state is looking for ventilators. If a health facility has a ventilator that they are willing to lend or sell to the state, they should contact the Department of Health.
> 
> In addition, Cuomo announced that all evictions will be paused for 90 days.

"I have a question as I notice a trend of work habits by companies who are doing this:  
Hiring people claiming to offer Sick days along with days off under the system of PTOs. So for example, Person 1 works certain hours a month and accumulates hours towards a PTO day.  When it comes to using a sick day, the company uses the same accumulated PTO day as it would for a PTO used for a vacation day.  
My question is this. With the NY Paid and Sick Leave Law enacted in 2014 ( [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/about/paid-sick-leave-FAQs.page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/about/paid-sick-leave-FAQs.page)), is this a violation of the Sick day law?  
Can companies force employees to use their earned PTO time for a Sick day? If the NY law exists, shouldn't it be a separation of guaranteed sick days and earned vacation days?  
Thanks."|NewYorkCity|2020|True|0
I'm staying in New York for 3 months to take an acting course. My dad doesn't want to send me there because rent is extremely expensive and he's worried I'd get sick or would need health insurance that covers emergencies and a bit more (like if I contract coronavirus for instance). Can anyone help me find a cheap/affordable health insurance that would cover me for 3 months while in New York? I won't be working while I'm there so I do need something cheap and very affordable.

Hi everyone,

There’s been quite a bit of panic online lately about the novel coronavirus, Covid-19. And so, I wanted to make a thread dedicated to rational discussion and preparedness in wake of NYC’s increasing amount of confirmed cases, and the increasing social changes we are experiencing. The information in this article comes from the [WHO](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/joint-mission-press-conference-script-english-final.pdf?sfvrsn=51c90b9e_2) press conference on Feb 24, 2020, and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) website. As this situation is rapidly evolving, the numbers and information in this article are subject to change.

**Now, here are some facts about the virus.**


Covid-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a class of virus where four strains are known to cause mild illnesses in humans, such as a few forms of the common cold, and three strains are known to cause some very serious illnesses, such as SARS, MERS, and now Covid-19. 


Pathogens vary widely in effect depending on how they evolve. Diseases like SARS and MERS had very high mortality rates (~10% and ~30% respectively), but ended up petering out before wreaking global havoc. Why? SARS and MERS are not known to be contagious in incubation. And on top of that, they were most contagious after the easily-identifiable symptoms show up, which led to the ability for public health officials to rapidly identify patients, isolate them, and then isolate those they had contact with. Thus, the diseases were contained before spreading wildly. 


It appears that Covid-19 has a much longer incubation period (while it is typically 2-14 days before symptoms show up, it appears to be up to even 24 days in some cases), many mild cases that go under the radar or are misdiagnosed as a cold or flu, and even some asymptomatic cases. The virus is capable of spreading during incubation period, which means that people have no idea that they are even sick when they are going about their daily lives, potentially infecting others. 


Right now, the numbers in the news are about confirmed cases. Cases only get confirmed when a person presents with a severe enough case of the illness to warrant testing. And until recently, testing for the virus was not even offered in most cities and countries unless the person had confirmed contact with someone who was a suspected carrier or travelled to China recently. This has led to a number of cases that were only diagnosed after a patient had been in and out of hospitals for many days, without adequate preventive measures being used. 


This virus appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets (~6ft range from an infected person), but is likely to also spread in some capacity via aerosol (much longer range than 6ft) and fecal-to-oral contact (so wash your hands after using the bathroom!) 



* **How does this compare to the flu?**


In many cases, the virus initially presents similarly to influenza, symptom wise. It then often evolves into pneumonia, which can cause severe health consequences. Unlike the seasonal flu, there is no vaccine to prevent infection, and there is no known effective treatment for it (though some antiretroviral medications may show promise for treatment.) As of now, most treatment is geared around keeping the patient alive with supportive care while their body attempts to fight off the virus. And there is increasing evidence that people who were initially considered “cured” of COVID-19 may again test positive later.


**Influenza has an R0 value of 1.5-1.6, meaning that someone with the flu will likely infect around 1.5 people.** The R0 value of Covid-19 is still being established, as we don’t know how many cases there really are. Recent case numbers in Europe suggest that this virus has been spreading in the community for quite a while, undetected. And when there was a reason to test in the wake of the Lombardy outbreak, hundreds of new cases were suddenly identified. As it is, **the WHO estimates the R0 value of Covid-19 to be between 2.0-2.5,** making it more contagious than the flu. 


The flu has a relatively low mortality rate, in large part due to vaccinations and known effective treatments, such as tamiflu. Covid-19 does not have any known effective treatments or a vaccine yet, and it may be many months before one has finished development and trials. See the [CDC’s numbers](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) on the yearly burden of the flu. **Last season, the approximate mortality rate for the flu was approximately 0.1%. It is currently estimated that Covid-19 has a mortality rate of 3.4%** according to the latest announcement by the WHO, but this number varies widely depending on the healthcare system in the country of the outbreak, the age of the patient, etc. A person who is elderly with preexisting health conditions has a far higher risk of death than a young person with no preexisting conditions. For examples, diabetes, heart disease, and being over 60 are all things that significantly raise the risk of complications and death. And likewise, a person who is turned away from medical treatment due to overflowing hospitals (such as has happened in Wuhan) also has a higher likelihood of mortality. 


To conclude, while the symptoms of Covid-19 may present similarly to the flu, is is both more contagious and has a higher mortality rate than the flu. There is currently no vaccine and no particularly effective treatment. While the flu has currently killed more people than Covid-19, the flu has been spreading globally for a much longer season, whereas Covid-19 has only recently begun spreading outside of China, and at that, only first emerged in December. If nothing changes, we are likely to see significant increases in case numbers and fatalities from Covid-19 in the coming months. 


* **So, how can you prepare?**


The most important thing is to avoid panicking. Be logical with your purchases and your changes to plans. 

Especially in a city like NYC, one of the major concerns with a large-scale outbreak is disruption to the supply chain. If any significant percentage of the population is sick or quarantined, this impacts the ability of grocery stores to re-stock essential supplies in the short term. Even if the virus has 80% of cases being mild to moderate, those people would ideally stay home from work. And the 20% of people who end up in the hospital can also lead to a significant reduction in the workforce, not to mention cause a significant burden on the hospital systems. This may severely impact the amount of people available to keep a complex city infrastructure running. 


And in the event of an outbreak or an advised or mandatory quarantine, this often leads to chaotic scenes in grocery stores, where everyone tries to stock up at once and brawls may break out.


It would be wise to build a few month’s supply of essential nonperishable foods for your household when you are able to, the sooner the better. The sooner people prepare, it eases the burden on the system when things get very bad and supply chains get disrupted. Plus, it frees up resources (whether grocery items or even delivery services) for your neighbors who weren't able to prepare as well as you were. 


Cover the essential amino acids and vitamins in your diet to avoid malnutrition, and consider buying a supply of multivitamins to supplement with. Protein powders are a nonperishable way to meet your protein needs, and many staple foods, such as milk and eggs, come in shelf-stable or evaporated forms as well. Brown Rice and Lentils is a great way to meet your essential amino acid needs, and while boring, it will keep you alive on a budget. A sack of flour and a bag of yeast (or learning to make sourdough with flour and wild yeast!) is much wiser to buy than a loaf of bread at this point. Fresh fruits and vegetables may taste great, but if you’re going to stock up, dried fruits and vegetables are much wiser to get. As is meat jerky as opposed to fresh meat. 

While we obviously hope that things never get truly bad, consider that NYC is a very population-dense area, which relies on a lot of food imports from very far away.  If those supply chains get disrupted, everyone is better off if they have a significant store of food while things get reestablished. Some of the countries that supply our imports are already significantly affected (i.e. expect Parmesan shortages), and some countries have yet to see significant impact. But there's no telling what the world will be like in a few months, as more and more countries close their borders and shut down industry.


Make sure you also have an adequate supply of essential medications, from NSAIDs, cold/flu remedies, and Neosporin/bandages to your necessary prescriptions. With the fact that many of these items are manufactured in China (where factories have been closed for months now), we are likely going to see shortages in the coming months while the virus works its way around the world.


It’s also easy to overlook toiletries. You don’t want to be set for food, and run out of toilet paper, diapers, soap, sanitary products, or toothpaste a week into a city shutdown. But don't get into brawls over toilet paper, either. It's much wiser to just get a [bidet with a dryer function](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=bidet+with+dryer&crid=201KHDGITA0XW&sprefix=bidet+wit,aps,140&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9&linkCode=ll2&tag=altiora20-20&linkId=ecbf528ba5008fa887dab52dc8ed78d2&language=en_US) anyways (plus, it's cleaner and more environmentally friendly!) Seriously though, this toilet paper situation is ridiculous. 

And don’t forget your pets! Buy enough pet food and supplies to last, and make sure you have any pet medications covered as well. 

Keep in mind that manufactured equipment may also face shortages as well. Many items have parts that are made in China or other affected countries, from cars to strollers to medical equipment. If there is something that you know you will need to buy in the coming months, it may be wise to get it now instead of hoping there is still stock available in the future. And if you are expecting any major life changes soon (like expecting a baby), prepare for them now rather than later. 


* **Lifestyle Changes**


**WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY, FOR 20 SECONDS AT A TIME, WITH WARM WATER AND SOAP. AND ALSO STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE** Seriously, that is one of the things that can be most effective in protecting you from illness. You are far more likely to touch a contaminated surface and then touch your face than you are to get sneezed on by a sick person. Also, if your skin gets dried out, lotion up frequently to protect your skin. Because having micro abrasions on your hands from your skin peeling off isn't good for you either. 


Avoiding crowds is almost impossible to do in NYC, with many people taking the MTA systems to work. In any case, if there is any way to limit your exposure to other people on trains and busses, it would be wise to do so. The WHO has officially advised that people over 60 avoid crowded spaces worldwide, as they are the most at-risk for serious Covid-19 complications.


Get lots of fresh air in your apartments and offices. It has been shown to reduce transmission.


Masks are getting hard to get ahold of these days, but as it turns out, most brands are not going to be very effective in protecting you from viroid particles. They often lose effectiveness as they are worn throughout the day, and most masks cannot be re-used. If anything, it is wiser for the people who are already sick to wear the masks, as it can keep their respiratory droplets inside. 


And a mask is only as effective as the rest of the hygiene practice of the wearer. If the mask is not properly fitted, and if you’re going to touch a public handrail and then touch your face or itch your eye, you may as well not be wearing a mask at all. 


In fact, the US Surgeon General has urged the public to stop buying masks, as most of them are not effectively used. And to top it off, the healthcare workers who need them most are hitting mask shortages.


Oh, and did I mention yet to **avoid touching your face, frequently wash your hands,** and if you are wearing gloves, make sure to take off and change your gloves before touching yourself or any food. 


If you are able to, work remotely. In fact, Governor Cuomo has urged people to work remotely and stay off public transit if at all possible. And if you happen to be in charge of a company with employees, please make modifications to allow your employees to work remotely and limit exposure to others. While productivity may be higher in an office setting, it's going to be a lot lower if your employees are all in the hospital because you made them come in when it wasn't necessary. And certainly do what you can to make allowances for sick leave—the US’s habit of forcing people to come to work while sick to avoid losing their jobs or income is what leads to people spreading disease. 

If you are receiving deliveries for food or essentials, limit your contact with the delivery person (for both their safety and yours.) It is currently unknown exactly how long the virus can survive on surfaces, so it may be wise to let nonessential deliveries sit alone for a few days before you come in contact with them. However, [current research](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815307842/research-coronavirus-can-live-for-a-long-time-in-air-on-surfaces) suggests 24h for cardboard, up to 72h on stainless steel, and up to 3h in the air, in laboratory settings. Real life conditions (changes in temperature, sunlight exposure, etc.) may make those numbers go up or down. 


* **If you are feeling ill, or have recently been abroad to an affected country, be considerate and STAY INSIDE.**


As the disease begins to spread in the community, take careful consideration if you yourself begin to feel ill. Covid-19 doesn't have exactly the same symptoms in everyone, but the general consensus that people who fall ill will often experience cold and flu like symptoms, with approximately 80% developing a fever. If you are feeling sick, have a fever, or are coughing, stay home as much as possible and avoid other people, especially crowded places. Wear a mask and gloves in public, limit your contact with others, and wash your hands frequently to reduce the likelihood if you infecting others. When you go to the doctor's office, call ahead of time to let them know of your symptoms so they can take adequate precautions to protect staff and other patients in the event that you are infected. Don't just go about life as normal--even if you are experiencing relatively mild symptoms, you may spread the disease to someone who could very well die from it. So be considerate of others, and protect the other members of our community. 

If you are placed under a voluntary quarantine or isolation, actually follow through with it. You may feel fine, but there are many stories in the news of people who ended up violating quarantine to go to a concert, a school event, or some other crowded space. And of course, later tested positive. Don't be a selfish idiot, and protect your community. **In Italy, those who break quarantine are charged with murder,** because an ill person who goes about their daily lives may very well directly cause another's death. So stay inside if you are sick.  


* **Don’t Panic**


In the event that NYC asks residents to stay inside and limit public gatherings, it’s easy to get stressed out. Keep active and healthy through in-home exercise (online videos for home workouts are a great resource), and find something productive to occupy your day. Take up a new hobby, get some good eBooks to read, or get addicted to a new video game. It would be a good idea to buy whatever entertainment supplies you might need ahead of time, just in case. 


Be sure to keep up to date with the news, as well as the official CDC and WHO recommendations. We are learning more about the effects of this virus every day, and sometimes information that was thought to be correct later turned out to be false. Don’t make any major decisions out of panic, like don’t kill your pets because you read that somewhere in China, people were throwing cats and dogs off balconies. **Take adequate precautions, and also remember that we live in a society. If a neighbor in need requires help getting groceries or doing basic tasks, remember that a little humanity can go a long way.** Take adequate precautions to protect yourself, but don’t let fear and stress get the better of you. So maybe share some of that stockpiled food with a neighbor in need, or share your game console to the neighbor’s kid so they aren’t bored out of their minds.

"Hi all,
I have been eating inordinate amounts of spinach lately (at least half a small bag every day, if not more). I have also received an email from Coles stating their records show I purchased an affected product.

I experienced a range of symptoms (Minor slurring of speech, dry mouth and skin, flushed face, heart racing, among others. No delirious episodes that I'm aware of).

Maybe I'm being a hypochondriac, but I am concerned. I plan to go see a doctor to get checked out for peace of mind. 

My main question is this: I've already consumed the spinach and thrown out the packages. Am I still entitled to a refund? Is there a body I should report my experience to in case there are longer term consequences?

" I  (22F) am definitely long overdue to see one, but a bit apprehensive  since all my previous experiences with psychologists were... Not good.

My  #1 choice would be someone who can see me via telehealth, since I  actually live a few hours out of Melbourne. I understand that this may  not be possible, so I'm also open to suggestions for people in the CBD  or along the Gippsland line (Pakkie, Dandenong, Clayton, Caulfield etc)  who I can travel to. I'm looking for people who are currently accepting  new patients, which I know rules out a lot already.

I'm  looking for someone who's experienced with female ASD and ADHD. Would  strongly prefer someone who's experienced working with young adults. Not  expecting to find someone experienced specifically with cult-related  trauma, but someone who works with emotional abuse or something is  probably close enough.

I find it  very off-putting when psychologists try to dive into a very rigid  approach (such as immediately making me choose whether I want to do CBT  or DBT, when I mention having symptoms of anxiety). I guess I'd probably  rather have someone with whom I can talk everything out with.

I'd prefer someone who's friendly/warm, but also a good psychologist. Bulk-billing would be a cherry on top, but not necessary.

"Hi everyone,  


I'm originally from Chile and I moved to Somerville more than 1 year ago.  


In the multi-family building apartment that I live in, there's a parking lot with a big dumpster, the problem that I have is that every day I see at least one or two rats going on it and running from me when I'm taking out the garbage or getting into my car.  


In Chile rats are dangerous because they transmit hantavirus, so if you see a rat you're not going to rest until you kill it, your whole family will join forces to kill that son of a bitch, but here in my building, my neighbors don't seem to care at all, I've asked my landlord many times to do something and... he doesn't do anything.  


I've seen traps in the parking lot, but... they are already full of rats and I haven't seen anyone changing them for new ones.  


Is this normal in the US/Boston? I've seen rats in other places, TD garden is full of them but that's a construction site, so I guess that's ""normal"", aren't they dangerous in here? if you tell that they're just ugly then I don't really care about them, I just don't want anyone in my family to get sick, specially my 10 month old son.  
What should I do? can I call the City Hall or someone to pass a fine to my landlord, maybe that way he'll do something about it."|Boston|2019|True|0

"So I've spent the better part of the day trying to stifle my rage after getting a letter from the school about my 1st grader's attendance.  He's missed 11 days of school this year and in thinking back that came from a bout of the flu, rsv, pink eye and a couple of colds.  Given that I send my germy kid to a school with hundreds of other germy kids, this doesn't seem too bad to me over a 7 month period. 

The letter went on to talk about an intervention plan if he misses any more school, getting juvenile courts involved, etc. and I'm just galled by this whole ordeal.  I realize this is just the school doing what is required from state law so I'm directing my ire there.  

I wonder how this arbitrary amount of time was chosen and who wrote these idiotic laws?  Not to make this political (although all things end up being that way), this state is run top to bottom by ""we love small government"" republican party so I'm struck by how hypocritical it is that ""they're from the government and they're here to help!""  I've read on some other sites how school funding is tied to attendance so I see the monetary incentive to hound me for a naked cash grab.

Overall this strikes me of a bygone ethos of ignoring communicable illness to ""power through it"" like it's some kind of badge of honor to show up sick and work through it.

"This was just (11/17 1 p.m.) released by the state:

The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has identified rabies in two stray kittens from North Conway, New Hampshire. DHHS is advising residents to avoid direct contact with any stray, feral, or wild animals, including cats and kittens, and exercise caution around unvaccinated pets, which can be infected with rabies by wild animals.

A concerned citizen picked up the first kitten with rabies and took it to the Conway Area Humane Society. Two veterinary practices cared for the kitten before it exhibited symptoms of rabies on November 11th and subsequently tested positive for rabies on November 13th.... A second kitten tested positive on November 16th and investigation is ongoing to identify people who may have been exposed.

Rabies is a virus that impacts the brain and other parts of the central nervous system. It is transmitted when an infected animal’s saliva makes direct contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. This usually occurs when a person or pet is scratched or bitten by an infected animal. If a person or pet does not receive appropriate medical care after a rabies exposure, the virus can infect the brain, cause neurological symptoms, and ultimately lead to death. Human infections are extremely rare in the United States, and preventative treatment is recommended for people who have an exposure.

All dogs, cats, and ferrets should have up-to-date rabies vaccinations. It is also highly recommended that certain livestock species receive rabies vaccinations."|NewHampshire|2023|True|0
"A couple days ago a NH native complained to me in the comments of another post that transplants don't give enough back to the community, and while I can't think of a single thing that isn't better in NH compared to FL other than maybe the variety of food and restaurants, it did remind me that I want to start doing more volunteer work as I'm closing on my  first year here and could really use the social aspect of it since as an autistic person I really struggle with making friends and even with my super kind neighbors I'm always scared of annoying them or overstepping my welcome. 

I've done volunteer work at the humane society and for local pet charities back home, but I feel like I'd be more useful doing something tech related and one thing I feel would both be very fulfilling for me and also give a lot back to the community is volunteering my time to educate older people on general use of technology like opening and replying to emails, getting pictures from their phone into an email, docuSign, creating online accounts, keeping their software up to date, keeping their computers virus-free and usable, and accessing the internet as a whole. Internet security and avoiding fraud and scams as well. 

The rest of this is just talking about my experiences as an employee of companies who serve these communities in finance and stuff and why I think it's important, but **TLDR** is that I have the patience and the knowledge to sit down and explain the basics to older folks who might need extra time and repetition to really understand what they're doing, and **I would love to know if there are any charity / non profit / social services groups out there already doing this stuff who need more help.** I know this is a kind of niche thing and a smaller state like NH probably has services like this under a different more broad charity and maybe I'm simply not googling the right things to find them.

\---

I have worked in non-IT call-center type jobs for finance and insurance companies over the last decade or so, and my first job was at a computer repair shop that did physical repairs and also virus removal and system restoration. Tech has rapidly become a necessity these days and it's very difficult to get by in modern times without a smartphone or computer at home. Banking, Insurance, utilities and a lot of healthcare resources are all very much online these days and a very common complaint I run into with our older customers (50s+ generally but it varies, poorer communities are also less likely to have tech savvy people even in their 20s-40s unless they have kid/teen/young adult children with the patience to sit them down) is that they really struggle with technology and often they even say they would like to learn but don't have anybody at home to help them with it.

I have had to spend a few years recovering from a car accident with a drunk driver that left it very difficult for me to walk and chronic pain that fucks with you soooo much both physically and mentally. I'm doing great now 7 years later, but I still suffer from chronic pain in my hands and fatigue from the fibromyalgia I developed as a result of my injuries. Today I spoke with and set up a car insurance policy for a 65 year old guy who has a few illnesses he didn't tell me the names of but also pretty severe gout in his hands, was struggling to even hold his phone up to his ear, was no longer able to write because of his hands, and told me he probably wasn't going to live past the end of the policy expiration as it was but he still needed his truck to get around as he didn't have anybody around who could help him. He expressed that he did not want to do anything online because he couldn't figure it out, said he would love to but doesn't have anybody to help him, and didn't even want me to walk him through it because he had already given up and again couldn't stay on the phone that long anyways because of the pain he was in. Really, this guy needed help years ago and didn't get it so it got to this point and I know from experience that it's really hard to learn stuff when your body is in constant pain.

It's already so hard to ask for help.  I personally believe that the vast majority of people CAN learn how to use tech at any age (sans disability or cognitive decline) but if it's not being explained to them well enough it gets frustrating and they give up, or pretend that they get it when they really don't out of embarrassment.  

Unfortunately not having the knowledge and education on computers and the internet as a whole exposes one of our most vulnerable populations to online scams, data breaches, and people trying to defraud them. A lot of companies charge more for paper billing and mailing out / signing documents (which tbh I can't blame them because it costs a LOT more to print stuff out and mail it than do it digitally and instead of building it into the price of the product and making people who don't use the thing that creates those extra costs, why wouldn't they only charge the people who want it printed and mailed for them?) and most retirement age folk are on fixed incomes and often really can't afford the extra cost. I'm more familiar with the communities in FL but I can't imagine the average social security retirement or disability check goes very far in NH either. 

Media literacy is also an issue too, a lot of people genuinely do believe most of the stuff they see on social media as true and misinformation spreads like wildfire online. I'm not talking politics, I'm talking ""Don't flash your headlights at someone who is driving without theirs on at night because it's a Hells Angels/Blood gang initiation thing and they will chase you down and murder you if you flash your lights at them"" or dozens and probably hundreds of other digital folklore myths that get spread around by well-meaning people just trying to keep their community safe. The issue with a lot of this is that these made up scenarios inspire REAL criminals to actually commit those crimes and give real life traffickers ideas on how to mark and get their next victims.

NH does have a more educated population than many other states, but we have an aging population too and lots of rural towns and I'm sure we have some communities that need more help than others. I have googled around and know there are paid services out there for people with the means to pay for it, but as someone who has spent most of my life just above poverty level and has a soft spot for retirement age folks, I'd rather do it with a charity or non-profit group. I think eventually as I work my way up the software development totem pole, it's something I'd maybe like to turn into a career. 

I also encourage anyone who has older parents / grandparents / friends and neighbors who maybe haven't asked for help but you can see are struggling and have the time to do it, please sit down with them and help them with their damn insurance paperwork and smartphones. You're showing them you care about them, protecting them from elder abuse and fraud, often saving them money, and also helping them with something that can be really frustrating and frequently embarrassing for them. The people in the building or call center at their bank / insurance company / doctor's office are rarely equipped or trained on how to efficiently walk people through their online services and often aren't that tech savvy themselves.

I've linked an NPR story, but I think it's important for locals to know that most media isn't covering this whole situation well.

1) formaldehyde, one of the ""less toxic"" chemicals being created as the spill breaks down, is known to cause spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) and infertility. 

2) they mention the EPA is taking air samples, but there is no mention of water sampling. Nearby cities and states along the Ohio River are testing their water and finding these dangers compounds 60+ miles away from the crash, indicating that they are in the Ohio River.

3) the Ohio River flows directly into...the Mississippi, so in a matter of weeks these chemicals are going to add to our already polluted water and air. 

If you can, it's a good time to invest in a high-quality filter. But we should also consider fighting for time off (sick leave and personal leave) and appropriate safety measures for rail workers, and stronger nationwide air and water protections.

"Register and comment here: https://www.bostonplans.org/news-calendar/calendar/2023/01/26/public-meeting-on-inclusionary-development-policy

Boston is seeking to increase the required amount of inclusionary zoning from 13% to approximately 20% (inclusive of vouchers).

While I urge everyone to participate in the public process, as someone who tried to afford a place in Boston proper and was unable to afford anything near work, it’s immensely frustrating to see the city adopt policies that prevents new residents from entering the city meaningfully

This proposal is unaccompanied by additional density bonuses or other types of upzoning. Inclusionary zoning puts the burden of cost for rent controlled housing on the developers, and the current proposal is backed by an economic [analysis](https://www.bostonplans.org/documents/projects/inclusionary-development-policy/inclusionary-development-policy-analysis-draft-exe). The city seeks to try and achieve the minimal return return that allows developers to profit. The study, however is flawed in this use of a low 5% interest rate and changing of measured return measures as needed between sections (between COC and IRR but not both at the same time) both symptoms of consultants seeking a desired outcome. 

This policy will likely further reduce housing production in Boston by making it required for developers to sell other market rate units at a higher price to cover the cost of income-restricted housing. 

Moreover inclusionary zoning been found in studies to increase market rents by an additional 1-3% per year [[citation]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26999944), which means that over the last ten years between $200-$600 in rent per month may be from Boston’s IZ policy. Thus, while 7,000 affordable unit’s have been added from the IZ policy, an additional 11,000 may have been displaced based on area AMI due to the greater increase in market-rate rents. (Contributing to the over 40k waitlist for income-restricted housing) 

Building more is the only way out and this policy discourages developers from building more housing by increasing the developer fees required for new production. This was noted as happening in Cambridge in the City’s own study “In the five-year period after the change, there was a 2% increase in the cumulative number of affordable units built and a 33% decrease in the cumulative number of market rate units built.” And even in Somerville where market-rate housing increased, it notes that most units stemmed from the pre-IZ zoning policy

A better way forward for income-restricted units is the high density AHO overlay that Cambridge has: https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Projects/Housing/affordablehousingoverlay. This overlay which allows between 13-25 story’s in height for 100% income-restricted housing has doubled the rate of new affordable unit production since its implementation"|Boston|2023|True|0
"Hi, I wanted to ask if anyone has any recommendations for PCPs in the BWH network that have some understanding of autoimmune disorders. My partner has psoriasis (where I figured out he has based on symptoms) and celiac disease (where my mom figured it out). The doctors here in Boston looked at my partner’s symptoms and never considered them to be autoimmune related until he mentioned it to them. 

Since my mom also has celiac’s and several other auto immune problems, she’s had a lot of experience with PCPs not being able to understand any of her health problems (and have even suggested prescribing antidepressants). I just don’t want to repeat that cycle for him too. 

I know there are specialists who can focus more on these conditions but if there are any general PCP recommendations I would appreciate it. Thanks"|Boston|2023|True|0

"I know many people are discussing the very real reality that protesting right now will likely lead to an influx of cases. I haven’t yet seen a conversation from those of us who are choosing to protest - how are you managing risk on a daily and weekly basis?

My partner and I are both deeply committed to justice for Black people and feel showing up for protests is important for us to do. Here are the kinds of things we are planning to put in place to keep others safe from us should we have the virus. Neither of us have a compromised immune systems, we don’t live with or care for our parents, and both of us work from home. Other than protests, we are only around other people when we need to grocery shop.

We are thinking of doing the following:

- obviously wearing masks during protest, using hand sanitizer etc.
- attending 1 protest a week so that we can hopefully catch COVID symptoms before we go to the next one (recognizing that we could be a symptomatic spreaders). 
- if we feel sick AT ALL, we will not attend a protest. 
- driving or walking to all protest, no public transportation
- getting tested (we are trying to figure out how often we should do so, as we don’t want to over use the resource)

I would appreciate any other ideas on how people are minimizing risk while committing to the important practice of protest. I understand many will not make this choice due to COVID, but hopefully this can be a space for those of us to feel strongly about protesting AND care deeply about public health. After all, racism and COVID are both public health issues!"|Boston|2020|True|0
"Story time!    
     
My roommate has been serving tables at a rather popular family-run restaurant in the city for the better part of four or five years now. Recently, he noticed that the head chef who owns a 10% stake in the restaurant has been harassing one of the female employees about her weight.    
    
A couple examples he recalled to me:    
Calling her over to ask that she settle a dispute between him and one of the other chefs over who weighs more, the busser or herself    
   
Telling her she's not allowed to wear clothing that shows off her midriff during pre-open prep hours (casual clothing outside of the uniform is allowed during pre-open prep) unless she loses some weight.    
   
Numerous times, its resulted in his coworker crying and due to her timid and sweethearted nature she has apparently just been rolling with the punches. My coworker finally got sick of seeing it happen and decided to try and do something about it.   
    
Now, the store manager (my roommate's boss) is actually below the head chef in the hierarchy, so he felt that going to his boss to complain about his boss's boss would be fruitless. So instead, he went to the only person with any real semblance of authority over the Head Chef: The Owner.    
     
He told the owner what was going on and had what he hoped was a productive conversation, and specifically asked that he remain anonymous in all of this. Well, an hour or two later he gets a call from his manager cussing him out and screaming at him. So he hangs up and calls the owner again, who tells him that she'll smooth it out.    
    
He got to work today and the manager has cut his hours in a  very obvious show of retaliation.     
     
Now that I've chewed your ear off bringing you up to snuff with whats going on, my questions is: What recourse does he have here? Should he go speak to a lawyer? Is he SOL because of At-Will Right to Work employment? Do Federal labor laws protect him in this situation, would he count as a whistleblower receiving retaliation even though the entire exchange happened internally?    
     
Just trying to figure out his best bet for approaching this."|Louisville|2022|True|0

\- Wearing masks. It doesn't look or feel weird anymore, and would be a good thing to see more people wearing them during flu season.

\- PTO. Should be available for all so workers don't have to come into work sick.

"This is a random question, but my son plays hockey and the city owned ice arena (in Wayne County) does not provide soap in the bathroom of the locker room. Upon contacting them, because 1) it’s disgusting and 2) our son, a few other players, and 2 coaches got the flu in February (despite flu shots)...the Recreation Director says that the city will not provide soap. He stated they’re in compliance with Wayne County Health and Michigan State Health Depts since it is a locker room and not a public restroom.

I can‘t figure out who regulates though - it’s not an OSHA situation since employees have other bathrooms, but I can’t find anything online. MAHA and USA Hockey (2 umbrella organizations) published a statement about frequent handwashing, but the Rec Director is not budging - even for disposable soap bottles. I’m tempted to buy bottles myself for all the locker room bathrooms, but I’m also just annoyed at the snarky response I got from him, and want them to take responsibility.

Any help for regulatory guidance? Are they technically within the guidelines? Do I just need to drop it and keep a bottle of soap in our hockey bag??

"Estimates of the R0 — the basic reproductive rate, or how many secondary cases you can expect for each new infection — vary enormously. There's a lot of missing information, so a lot of guesses are being made in mathematical models. Most of the estimates are around 3-4, and that's *before* any public health measures are taken. With SARS, it started out around 3, but after preventive measures were enacted, it wound up at 0.38. So don't panic about transmissibility.

Secondly, there are about 41 confirmed deaths from 1200 confirmed cases. That suggests morbidity and mortality are likely to be low as well. There will be deaths that have not yet been correctly identified as being caused by 2019-nCoV, and they will be added to the tally as testing catches up. However, there will be many, many more cases found in people who didn't get sick enough to visit a doctor or hospital. The mortality rate is number of deaths divided by total number of cases. So the raw number of deaths will increase, but it's likely the reported mortality rate will decrease.

Some cause for concern: the virus has a latency period where someone has the illness without symptoms. Some estimates say 6 days and others 16. That's a worry. However, now that we know about the epidemic, there will be a lot of contact tracing going on, based on flight and travel records. What we don't currently know is how *much* contact you need to have with someone who has the virus in order to acquire it. Most of the clusters we've seen have been families, where even a condition that is quite hard to transmit will be passed on, because families live in close proximity and spend a lot of time together. So — watch this space on that one.

Should you avoid Chinese people, as some posts have suggested? Fuck no. Wuhan is 11m people out of more than a billion. The odds of meeting someone from Wuhan are extremely slim, and those slim odds also apply to *all the other Chinese people* in Sydney. While I'm addressing ethnospecific fears, I'm seeing tweets claiming that China 'hid' the epidemic. That's not even remotely true. It took a while to identify an epidemic in the first place, because it's a novel virus and we hadn't isolated it to test for it. China learned from the SARS epidemic and access to data on this epidemic has been exceptional. They have also taken rapid action, although this epidemic coinciding with CNY is not great luck.

Lastly, P2/N95 masks... there's good evidence that this virus is *not* airborne. If it were, given the kind of crowds that pass through the initial cluster site (a fresh market), we'd be seeing tens of thousands of cases. Most coronaviruses are not airborne. Indeed, what we call the common cold is caused by a group of coronaviruses. They are passed on via tiny traces of mucus or saliva, which you encounter in your environment, you get some on your fingers, and then you touch the mucus membranes on your face — your eyelids, your nostrils, your mouth — and BAM, you get the cold. (I'm religious about washing my hands, using a knuckle to press lift buttons or ATM buttons, using a shirt-tail to open toilet doors, not touching my face, etc, and I pretty much never catch a cold.)

So you don't need to worry about airborne transmission. A P2/N95 mask might help if it keeps you touching your nose/mouth (and you don't rub your eyes). A mask may also help contain *your* body fluids and provide some protection to others, if you have an URTI. But you don't need to worry about airborne contagion in crowds.

"People fucking suck.

I guess I can get a bit more specific. I work in a hockey rink while wrapping up my bachelors' degree. Nothing crazy, at least before the pandemic. Just your usual condescending, ""know-it-all"", selfish hockey parents and of course there's good parents but they stay quiet, watch their kid play and go the fuck home. They don't slam beers in the parking lot.

Well we had our first taste of a large hockey tourney since the pandemic started, we've had plenty of college and HS games but those are done in a few hours. This tourney was stretched across 12 sheets of ice in multiple rinks with nearly 100 teams participating. With about 20 kids on a team, that's about 2,000 families and around 7,000-10,000 people traveling from 3 different states to most likely watch their kids team lose. One even wound up in the hospital, fun but not unusual.

What got to me though was, with the rink being the closest to reaching max capacity in 14 months and about 20 signs saying a mask is required to be in the place, there was only about 20% of people wearing a mask. The rest clearly didn't even have on them. The teams did not wear masks at all. I know for a fact none of those kids are vaccinated, I can't say the same about the parents but based on how most of them bitched about lockdowns and covid I cant imagine it was very many. Our locker rooms are not big, with them playing multiple games a day for 3 days and using locker rooms that are occupied 16 hours a day there is no way covid was not transmitted. I can't speak for cross-team exposure but if any kid had it, they most certainly spread it too many teammates who will then give it to their parents.

This shit is fucking stupid, I just couldn't believe it. If we were close to herd immunity, fucking fine, not ideal but fine. But we're not even kind of fucking close to that point and with this shit going we will never be. And all for what? Shit triple a hockey cash grabs? So you can slam beers in our parking lot while your kid plays and your other 2 run around the fucking rink like a daycare? So you can brag to other dumbass parents about all the shit you've ""gotten away"" the last year or about how tipped the first waitress that served you without a mask on $40 because you're just so fucking special? Sorry this just became a rant but my god people are fucking stupid. Even if everyone there was vaccinated except the kids, which they weren't considering many were Dakotans', the kids are still gonna be mass spreaders. If you have a kid in hockey you know that it's pretty much a god damn guarantee that after a 3 day tournament they'll be sick on Wednesday. But nah, fuck the classmates they'll inevitably force into a quarantine.

&#x200B;

But yeah, to sum it up, we'll never see herd immunity and it's very ironic since the people who bitch the most about covid and lockdowns are the very reason for that."|Minnesota|2021|True|0
"I was gifted some tickets to a midweek concert at the Palais which was awesome, but my last experience getting to and from the Palais on public transport wasn't great.  Without traffic, I'm 50 minutes to the Brunswick East 96 tram which takes a further 80 minutes to get to the theatre.  Last time, there was absolute bedlam getting back on a tram and it took over two hours to get home so close about 4.5 hours to travel 130km round trip mixing car and PT.  This was pre-pandemic so the evening rush hour and heaps of students in the CBD.

I hate to be that ""one more"" car on the road, but it's the long trip home when there's very little traffic is what has me considering driving in.  Google has driving to the Palais at about 55 minutes without traffic so you could double that with evening traffic.  I haven't been in the city much since WFH has been a thing, so I'm not sure if I'm talking myself into saving time or just creating a big headache.  Even if it takes two hours to get there, I could still save a hour off the return trip potentially, but then there's parking problems etc.

Thanks in advance."|melbourne|2022|True|0

"Hi all!

I'm not sure who to ask so I thought I'd turn to you lovely people for help! 

I currently work on an office floor that's split by a thin wall and shared ventilation between two businesses (the company that I work for + a company that is currently undergoing complete renovations). It is during these renovations that they are tearing their side of the floor apart, and both my coworker and I feel like we're getting sick and nauseated inhaling the smells during all their construction work. These orders smell like a combination of paint fumes and chemicals, leaving us with headaches, sore throats, and coughs. I've tried opening all the windows at the office, but the smells just come through the shared ventilation!

Ive talked to the building manager this morning saying there's nothing he can do, Ive let my boss know last week and he said he'll work on it. What options do I have? I love working for my company, but I literally cannot tolerate this toxic smell anymore without feeling severely ill!"|melbourne|2022|True|0
"hiya,
firstly - PLEASE only recommend from personal experience. i’ve been running round in circles for months!! 

tldr - if you have ADHD and have been to a psychologist who was able to help you, please let me know. i am hoping for someone in the inner north, but i am happy to commute if need be. will begrudgingly accept telehealth if i absolutely have to 

 i have been looking for a new psych for a year now and i’m getting to a point where i don’t feel like i can keep waiting. the issue i keep running into is that i have severe ADHD so very few psychs are actually trained to work with my brain.  i have tried talking to psychologists who don’t specialise in, or have ADHD, and i find myself spending every session explaining my symptoms instead of doing therapy. it’s a waste of time and money. the issues i want to work on aren’t all specifically ADHD related, but obviously it plays into literally every part of my life so it’s important to have a therapist who is good at working with it."|melbourne|2023|True|0

"I've been dealing with mental health issues for nearly my whole life but things started getting really bad when I was 15. I'm 27 now and have tried many different medications and have been seeing psychologists and psychiatrists for a long time.

I currently dealing with anxiety, depression, ADHD, OCD, Anhedonia, Depersonalisation/ Derealisation. I also have been dealing with POTS symptoms for the last year and a half.

I've tried many medications including SSRIs, SNRIs, Antipsychotics, Lyrica, Gabapentin, Mirtazapine, Clomipramine, Nardil etc. with not much success. Benzos and stimulants help a lot but I try not to use them much. I use Benzos twice a week and I don't have access to stimulants because I'm still on the waiting list for a Psychiatrist that can prescribe them. 

I've started seeing a new psychologist and have had a couple of sessions with her. I'm waiting to see a Psychiatrist, I have to wait another 2 and a half months. I've been waiting for this psychiatrist for most of the year. 

I really struggle and feel like my quality of life is really low on most days. I deal with suicidal thoughts but will not go through with it because I don't want to put my family and friends through that and I genuinely believe I can get better. 

I'm struggling during the wait to see this psychiatrist and waiting another two and a half months is going to be horrible for me. I eat healthy and am trying my best to live an active lifestyle. I'm meditating more often as well.

Can anyone in this sub offer some advice or is anyone in a similar situation?"|melbourne|2023|True|0
"Stupid me used Exit Mould to clean the mould from the bathroom ceiling. Though windows were open and the bathroom door was also open as I read the instructions before using. Double N95 mask, wearing a cap, glasses, gloves and made sure no drop touches me anyway possible. I was cleaning the mould for possibly 25-30 mins but a break to walk away every 7-8 mins. 
Went to play soccer post the cleaning session and started feeling slight pain in the eye. Cut to next day, a minute looking swelling in the lower eyelid. Day after, visible eye stye and I visited a GP for meds. I have never experienced any eye styes before this. Now I’m feeling not 100% breathing sometimes like the lungs are not full.

Preferably looking for someone that does in person appointments and specialises in treating men’s mental health specifically.

I think McMansions are just another symptom of our terrible housing market and I'm not bothered by them, in fact I somewhat appreciate them.

People just want somewhere nice to live... if all you can afford is 350sqm, why not just plop the biggest house you can afford on it? It's a side effect of people not affording to have their massive house on 1000sqm with a lovely set back and a nice backyard anymore. Space unoccupied by house is a waste. A garden you just have to maintain, it's space you can't use, a spare bedroom you don't have...

Take the one linked above in question in Balwyn, if that was on 2000sqm, with a lot more greenery, set much further back, in the middle of a large block, I doubt it would bother anyone at all. But because it has no set back, and is close to both neighbours who also have large houses, it's a 'monstrosity'. And if the McMansion style is what they like, so be it.

It's better than the endless sea of Colourbond Monument copy-paste jobs in all the new estates.

I worry Australia (read: capital cities but it's not like region is 'cheap' anymore) is quickly following an old adage I've heard about Hong Kong's real estate (paraphrasing).

"I started renting an apartment in Melbourne 4 years ago that was never advertised. I initially applied for the apartment above and the landlord had an identical apartment on the ground level with exactly the same floor plan.  I accepted the contract and my medical records show that I started to get sick 6 DAYS after moving in with fatigue and lethargy. I had just gone though a break up and I associated my mental state and lack of energy with severe depression. 

There was no visible black mould on site until about 2 years of staying in the apartment. Black mould spots started forming on the ceiling of the bathroom after the paint on the wall started bubbling and cracking. I reported this to the landlord immediately who sent a person over with a bucket of bleach who cleaned the walls. Later a plumber came over, replaced the broken pipes in the wall and replaced the whole shower. 

Soon after I started to develop peripheral neuropathy - where I get numbness my hands and feet. Initially my finger-tips pruned up and return to normal within 1 minute while sitting on the couch. Then I started to get muscle cramps though the back of my skull, now my hearing is damaged with buzzing tinnitus in both of my ears. I lost my employment due to brain fog, though I got the Covid-19 redundancy payments. Being out of work, I spoke to the gardener one early morning over a cup of tea. It turns out he's a relative of the landlord. We got into a conversation as why the up stairs apartments have remained vacant for the past year or so. He informed me the landlord legally cannot rent them out, as the foundations of the apartment block are moving. This explains the busted pipes in the bathroom wall. Neither the landlord of real-state agency I lease though have ever notified me of the premise being condemned.

Months later I got diagnosed with mycotoxic poisoning through a urine test via my Naturopath. The toxin levels in my system are 8 times higher than dangerous (trichothecene group) and over 3 times higher than dangerous (ochratoxin A) . I moved out of the apartment about 6 weeks ago now, but my bodily damage has barely improved. I now have constant numbness though 70% of my body. My naturopath has given me an 18 months prognosis for recovery due to the severity of my poisoning. I now have a significantly high chance of bladder cancer, auto-immune diseases, lymph node necrosis, severe liver damage, body-wide tumours, gut health issues, T and B cell issues... amongst a long list of other likely future problems. I'm booked in with a respiratory specialist late September for a medically licensed prognosis.  

I've spoken to five lawyers from separate law firms so far. To summarise; ""We've all had absolutely no success in suing for black mould related injuries, when it comes to pain and suffering, even if the landlord has intentionally put the residents lives at risk, which has resulted in harm. In most cases it's almost impossible to prove that as well. These matters are normally handled by VCAT who only award claims for direct loss and damages. You need to have at least a 5% Whole-Body-Impairment to make any claim. You can't make a claim if you sustained impairment began over 3 years ago, and your symptoms started 4 years ago. We won't take your case."" The last lawyer I spoke to reconfirmed the above, stating ""Now, I'm not going to defend the law - but this is how it is..."". WHAT DO YOU MEAN... you're not going to defend the law? She was saying that some of the laws that are accorded to are over 30 years old, where the long term dangers of mould weren't understood.

....

This seems criminal. A person has put my life at risk numerous times, which has caused me severe bodily harm, for their own financial gain... and lawyers have told me there's NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. I have too much brain fog to process this.

TL;DR - Black mould poisoning. Landlord likely rented me a previously black mould condemned apartment he legally couldn't advertise. He failed to notify me the property is condemned to to structural damages too. I now have severe health damage. Lawyers have in round-abouts-words informed its somewhat of a VCAT embroiled, landlord protection corruption racket."|melbourne|2023|True|0

"I'm a bit late to post, as I have been walking the streets of Newstead and The Valley all morning, bridle swaying in my loose grip as do I - after last night - attempting to piece together what could have happened.


Rode into the city from Hendra, later on last night, bareback save for a saddle blanket. St. Patrick's Day and craic. 

It was a lovely night, serene in fact, and riding into town was less to draw attention to myself and more for the joy of getting Clagg out for a trot around the town after a couple of $10 jugs at the Hammo with good company earlier...

..though attention I did soon get; 

**If it wasn't** the young bloke on a newfangled electric velocopede, who shot to me a look of disdain as I dismounted at Newstead house to kick a freshly laid family-pizza sized horse shit into the gardens (whilst Clagg found joy in devouring the Hibiscus, oblivious to the haters)... 

**If it wasn't** the irate screaming of a middle aged woman in a black Porsche Macan with short bottle-blonde hair whose number plates read 'TAMPAX' or something equally as ironic for someone so blatantly menopausal... 

**Then it was most certainly** the brigade of airpods and activewear zombiss in their animated shuffling gawking at me, over *there*, swatting and swiveling on my unstable mount like a madman due to the fuckin' *mosquitos*. 

The floods had infested the area around Brekky Creek with mosquito larvae. I had been practicing for that, doing my PV exercises, and with the almighty discipline of a Shaolin monk I clenched my urethra shut so hard you would probably be able to hear it snap closed. 

^*Pip!*

I didn't want to get that Japanese virus that makes your head big but your brain dumb, and for my increasingly greying matter to squirt out like paté in a clenched fist. Each beleaguered wave of my arms to fuck these little bastards off seemed to only scoop more toward me, and to the swish of Clagg's automatic insect wipers kicking into gear, I realised 'they' were right. *This was a fucked idea*. 

*This was a FUCKED idea!*

I had to get the fuck outta there - but of the two of us 'enjoying' this evening saunter toward the city, *I* was the one more likely related to a mule - as my arrogance simmered with my blood, which now no doubt contained all manner of mosquitoborn pathogens. We moved steadfast, at a deliberately slow pace that held up every cunt for miles, until eventually we took a creative left turn and ended up at the City Botanic Gardens. 

Couldn't stop here at night, it's crack country. Somebody would steal my shoes - or the horses. Might even end up stealing my horse. I'm not sure whether the laws on horse theft are equally as archaic - though I would hope so - but I didn't want to risk it with ol *seabiscuit.*

Earlier in this quest I had remembered some helpful redditor's advice from last week's thread, wherein they explained there still exists an archaic law for equine hospitality on behalf of the publican, and as such I sought to stable my horses at The Vic for a quick beer.

I reined old Claggs around and paced up a couple blocks, and forced my way through the line like a mounted copper to state my business there. The bouncer wouldn't fucking hear of it, nor did his cocked eyebrow lowering into an indignant glare indicate that he appreciated a lecture from somebody on their high horse, as it accompanied a sharp if not overly polite ""Yeah, look, fuck off mate"". 

*Righto cunt* I thought, *I know of a place with looser standards* - and gee'd my steed to turn tail on a dime, thrusting an arm out to give The Victory hotel the reverse Victory sign whereby I almost immediately went arse up and had to scramble like a cat in a shower so as *not* to go arse-up, then I clumsily advanced like ten pounds of shit on the back of a ball-crushing machine to the valley - to RGs..

And loose it was, at it always is.

I dismounted, tied the reins around a fixture outside of Blutes, and gave Clagg's a thorough pat - swatting a fee straggling mozzies in the process, with a now red right hand. The Vic might have not known about horsepitality, but the kind staff *here* did when I presented them with a galvanized pail that looked very much like one that was on a table outside RGs moments earlier - and they gladly discarded the contents (why would Claggs want to drink something so reminiscent of his own piss?), and filled it with fresh water for their ornery old new best friend. 

The bouncers here were no trouble at all - in fact it wouldn't be unfair to say they had their blinkers on for trouble, as I walked up bow-legged and sore from my bare-back misadventures (not unlike most in line), my horses' lumbering gait crushing my balls on his wither with every bounce as I had no stirrups to lean into. 

My balls were sore and they were swollen, thankfully quite unlike my brain - which still produced ample rattle when I nodded back to the bouncer disinterested in my documentation - and my bladder surely distended with several jugs full. 

To the pisser I go, tenderly handling my goods without it looking too sus, and relaxed my urethra. 

^*pop!*

.. it flowed forth like an everlasting bottle of champagne. Holy fucking shit, isn't it the best feeling in the world? I was lost to ecstacy, eyes closed in bliss as the urinal dutifully received my piss. 

It was at the urinal that I bumped into a wee lad - quite literally, accidentally elbowing the green glittery plastic top-hat from his head as I zipped up in an overly triumphant manner. The portly man of smaller stature, in a green velvet sportcoat over a bright green silk vest, bent down and gingerly picked his hat from it's slow drift along the the length of the urinal, shook it three times and then put it back in place atop his bobbling head, before *then* hauling in his hog with both hands and fastening the button on his trousers. *Ah, of course - a leprechaun.* 

St. Patrick's Day and all. 

Now, I did make to apologise, but he waved me nonchalance with his piss-drip flinging hands and shuffled over to the sink and retrieved a small glass of beer that he stashed there, and stood under the hand dryer, the warm air tussling the shocks of red hair hanging beneath the rim of his hat. 

His cold stare prompted me ""sorry mate, didn't see ya down there, you caught me off-guard""

The stare lingered upon me as I lingered in the bathroom, feeling like a bit of an asshat in the moment, I looked at his empty glass. *why the fuck to people take glasses into the toilets?*

""Aye 'tis nothin', I suppose you caught me - wit ye elbow""

""..."" 

""...""

*Oh, I get it. Because he's a leprechaun and you've got to catch them or someshit.*

He let out a gigantic boisterous laugh that boomed through the acoustics of the bathroom, handed me a rolled up 50 from his breast pocket and said """"Oil shout te first roun'"". 

I looked at the glass in his hand, and thought I'd make a joke of my own: ""Pot of Gold?""

His cheery disposition faded. *Ah, fuck*. He didn't see the craic in it, and replied in a lower, measured tone. 

""Ah, p'aps a pony will do.. ""

Being quick witted, I realised with awkwardly slow pace that he meant the 140ml measurement 'Pony' glass. I hadn't heard that for ages - but then I don't usually rub elbows with smaller folk very often.
Must be a responsible drinker, this very reasonable fellow.

Have you ever tried to get to the bar at RG's during some fuckery event that the entirety of Brisbane uses as an excuse to get on the piss?

You'll know what was in store, then. 

I suggested my newly met benefactor kick it outside, maybe smoke a Wee Willem, while I waited in line. 

It must have been 40 minutes - bank app gives me 10:39pm - and for 40 fucking minutes I listened to awful covers of Darryl Braithwaithe's 'Horses' that must have been requested three or four times in that period, before I managed to get to the cursed counter. Drinks in hand, a nagging thought in the back of my mind came to - I had forgotten the my own horse was tied up outside Dominos and thought I had better fuckin' check that it hadn't kicked over the bucket of water the generous barstaff of Blutes had kindly provided, or that some moron - who had walked here in their RMs after getting kicked out of Johnny Ringos for being a bit *slightly too much* of a fuckwit and reeking of house-bourbon - wasn't trying too hard to prove some point nobody else gave a fuck about. 

Tied to my obligations of locating four foot five of festive fury in the crowd of frothing fuckwis to deliver his drink, I spent a solid fifteen minutes of earnest searching before I forfeit and went to check on Clagg. 

*Clagg?* 

I get out there. Horse, gone. Just a high-stool laying on it's side. 

*That little bastard.*

Beside me, a clusterfuck (as is the collective term) of drunken Dominos patrons were in a heated argument with the staff about pizza diametres, screaming and crying, a vein bulging in the shaven dome of the one nearest me as he attempted in vain to lift the barricade from its footings..

Slightly less inebriated than these fuckers, holier-than-thou *I* interjected at this precise turning point of the mayhem ""Ay mate you seen any horses?"" 

Baldy froze, and stood upright as a strange transitional calm swept through his body. *Was this thought in motion?* After a very special moment akin to primitive man discovering fire, I thought with some relief that he'd finally illuminated a flickering lightbulb in his mind. 

He swayed forward, opened his mouth as if to speak - and in it displayed to me the works-in-progress of tomorrow's inevitable shit - before he closed his mouth again and swayed backyard, stiff as a board about to topple.. 

..and just at the peak of his arc, he suddenly plummeted onto his haunches in an ungodly slut-drop on the pavers and into a completely expected and reasonable Gollum impression: ""Yeasssss, we've ssseeen your precious whorsesss. They're at love and rocketsess"" 

I could rolled my fuckin' eyes. *Fuck's sakes*. I guess everything is funny when you're drunk. I thanked him for the information with a curt response; ""Arsehole"", bulged my reddening cheeks with breath and let out a long exhale of defeated contemplation of the sort I would imagine many saintly hospo workers are familiar with, and walked off in that direction regardless of the lack of eager helpfulness to be found in the shit-tier pizza lovin' *neanderthale* that inhabit the valley on every night of the week. 

And I loped off. At least that part of the night I couldn't forget - the rest.. 

..I cant remember quite yet recall. I have a mild headache that pains me still, and my thinking is cloudy. I'm piecing together my transactions and recollections tonight in effort of relocating my faithful friend. 

**Did anyone see a good boah last night or this morning? I can't fucking locate him.**

His name is 'Clagg' - though he doesn't come when you call it. Bay in colour, few fucks given in temperament, has a white *blaze in the northern sky* on his forehead which I lean forward and scritch in reassurance when he's been of particularly good service, and likes hanging out in gardens.

"With the impending lockdown and likely wave of cases in Canberra, the question remains whether COVID testing in Canberra is adequate to service the population. This should entail the type of clinic, hours of operation and eligibility requirements.

Of the 6 testing sites available (https://www.covid19.act.gov.au/stay-safe-and-healthy/symptoms-and-getting-tested/where-to-get-tested-in-the-act?utm_source=Popularlinks&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=Popular%20links), 2 are clinics requiring appointments, 2 are drive through only and 1 is Indigenous clients only. Only the Weston Creek testing site effectively ""anyone, any time"".

None of the testing sites are in the population dense areas of Canberra CBD or Gungahlin. You can't get a COVID test at a GP or hospital. To my knowledge, every other state and territory offers COVID testing through GPs and several have home testing regimes.

As someone who doesn't drive, noting that the respiratory clinics will no doubt be overwhelmed immediately, my only option to responsibly get tested is the Weston Creek testing site. How do I get there? I can either pay the privilege of a $100 Uber round trip and risk infecting 1 person, or take public transport for over an hour each way while sick with symptoms including a fever and risk infecting a bus and light rail full of people.

"I got my second Pfizer shot yesterday afternoon and, although I had zero side effects with the first round, the second shot has lived up to its reputation. I feel physically terrible, but I know that it's just my body learning to fight off those pesky spike proteins, and I'm so happy to be fully vaccinated (although I know it will be a few weeks before the highest level of immunity actually sets in).

Depending on the pathway this virus takes us, I have need to be in Darwin over Easter this year.  Would I be right to assume that even in the best of circumstances, Easter in Darwin is a pretty boring affair?  I'm staying in the CBD if that makes a difference.|darwin|2020|True|0
"I'm tired of paying $50 (after medicare rebate) for a 5 minute annual blood pressure check + cholesteral order, then paying $50 two days later to hear that there are no issues with the test results.  Seriously - $100 for 5 minutes of 'face time'. It's a rort.

I'm looking for a bulk biller that can get me in, take my blood pressure and ship me out for whatever pissy amount the bulk billing service fee is.

And when I get genuinely sick - eventually - then I'll book a real appointment and pay a fair fee out of pocket.

Any recommendations?

Edit: Google often won't say if they bulk bill."|brisbane|2017|True|0
"I find people (at work, anyways) are pretty black and white about it - either you get it and it's fine, or you got it once and it made you horrifically sick so you avoid it at all costs.

Unfortunately I'm in the latter, got it once and I got extremely sick, so haven't had it for a few years. However, I'm thinking of running the gauntlet this year. 

What are you doing? What have you experienced before? Do people get it/not get it at your work? Does everyone get sick at your work?

"My doctors say I'm sick, the treatment is going to be rough.  No idea what happens at the end of it.  The weight is dropping off me pretty fast so I'd like a record of what I look like right now (which looks healthy enough) before things go south.

Any recommendations for a studio or photographer who can do some stuff within a week?  I'm weak and can't drive anymore, so please let me know where you're at before I can say yes.  I'm reasonably close to the CBD.  I'm a woman, and I only need a head and shoulders portrait.  Just the one shot.

"I have been moving house these last few weeks, and stumbled upon a letter from my old residence asking me to attend jury duty.

It advised I had to submit my eligibility by the 10th of March to be placed in the second ballot to be potentially selected for a case started April 10th.

I'm worried sick as the top of the letter advises they can fine me $1000 or 2 months jail time. I called up the QLD government and they advised I would need to call the Supreme Court tomorrow on 07 3247 4313 as they are closed now.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I have a legitimate reason I could not have attended, however I doubt they will be interested eligibility after the cut off period, and with having just moved over the last few weeks I genuinely have not seen the letter until just now.

EDIT: For anyone following or having the same issue in the future. I called the Supreme Court number provided above, had a two minute conversation with a guy on the phone. He told me to go online and submit my application for it (The one due in March) and it would be fine. 

I did that, along with a letter from my employer advising why I should be exempt. 2 Hours later I get an email saying everything's fine and there will be no penalty. Good result."|brisbane|2017|True|0
"Ok, I know this will probably be controversial but I'm at the end of my tether and I'd really appreciate the chance to hear from people who have had similar experiences.

Partner and I have recently moved into an apartment in a small complex of 3 units. The landlord owns the whole building and our lease includes the following statement:

>Tenants and their guests must NOT smoke inside the property, on the balcony or in the courtyard area.

So one of our neighbours smokes several times a day and seems to be home all the time. I largely work from home so I cop a lot of smoke. We don't have aircon so summer was unbearable, closing windows was not an option. It seems like this person is actually smoking more than they did when we first moved in, and it's driving me nuts. I also have asthma so sometimes I'll get struck with a coughing fit while I'm in the kitchen or office where the smoke is the worst.

I don't want to tell this person how to live their life, but I don't think they should be doing this when it's written into the lease that they can't. Has anyone else had to confront neighbours about this? I'm not sure how to go about it. I've never met this person. I don't want to be a complete arsehole but I'm sick of feeling like shit whenever I'm home. Any advice very welcome, thanks."|brisbane|2017|True|0
"With Phoenix getting its first dust storm of the 2020 season today, there’s certainly a lot of excitement around, especially from newcomers to the desert. As a lifelong Phoenician, I can say this: **Stay indoors when there’s dust outdoors.**

Why? Well, the dust can carry fungal spores called Coccidioides (or cocci), which can cause Valley fever. While we’re all talking about another respiratory infection this year, Valley fever is something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The symptoms can be flu-like, and although most will recover, some will have long-term complications.

If you can stay inside during a dust event, you’ll be better off."|phoenix|2020|True|0
"Hey, Phoenician redditors. I hope I chose the correct flair.

I'm scared and don't know where else to turn.

My girlfriend suffers from chronic depression, the symptoms of which are becoming increasingly more intense. She is open to in-person counseling, medications, and even voluntary in-patient psych holds, but I've been having difficulty finding a facility or counselors that will answer or even return my calls. Some of these places just hang up on me.

She works minimum wage and has a cheap health plan with Aspen Insurance, and requires whichever option I find not plunge her into medical debt. She doesn't want tele-health counseling during COVID, and I've heard horror stories about mental hospitals who dehumanize their patients or need them to strip down in front of an examiner. I fear she'll become uncooperative over an experience like that. Balancing budget with quality is a nightmare, let alone getting someone to answer the phone. I'm willing to drive her as far as she needs, but anything in the North Valley (near the 17/101) is preferable.

We're both young, dumb, broke, and live together. Since I've been tasked with this I feel so helpless and distressed watching my soulmate fall apart, I'm trying to stay strong for her but don't know what else to do.

"Not what it sounds like. I’m trying to help my 70 year old dad. He says he can only get his pain meds from a clinic. That his regular dr can’t prescribe them.


So he’s been driving to this separate clinic for a few years now. They occasionally call him for pill counts. No issues. 

Except Monday they call him. He’s at the hospital with my mom bc she’s had a heart attack. He tells them why he can’t make it; they demand proof. My mom’s dr says she’ll fax his drs office info to prove he’s not lying. 

So they say fine but you need to come in tomorrow. He goes in Tuesday…he’s off by one pill in the count. They called him yesterday and dropped him as a patient. 


My mom can’t help bc she’s still in the hospital and my dad is freaking out. I’m trying to help but I don’t understand why he would be dropped after this. I also don’t understand why his dr can’t help him find another clinic or Dr to go to. 


I understand the epidemic in our state but I cannot understand how or why a 70 yr man with a huge history of medical issues is being treated this way. 



Any help or advice here? It’s not pill seeking druggies. It’s my elderly dad and I hate he’s being treated this way especially in such a high stress time with my mom being sick. "|WestVirginia|2024|True|0

"My last post on here wasn’t very critical really and maybe I had came off too strongly and didn’t really state what I wanted too do even though no one asked me and was focused on other things I plan too try too get into West Virginian politics these are some things that I want too do that I think could greatly help our state not everything but some things for those who saw that post 

-Legalization of marijuana 
-reform how we treat and deal with drugs I feel like we need too focus more on fighting against drug dealers, producers and distributors and I propose the idea for state rehab centers where instead of sending addicts and those possessing in prison we could send them instead too a state rehab center where they could get the proper help needed as well as educational opportunities and job/career training and opportunities and we stop making drug possession a felony and make it a minor crime while actually hammering down against drug dealers, possessors and distributors 
-homelessness is merely getting worse I propose a Housing first program as well as public housing too try and combat it as well as possibly a career training program 
-I propose a sales tax on both tobacco and alcohol of 30 percent it would bring in more revenue for the state 
-I propose raising the corporate tax too 25 percent 
-I propose a sugar tax of 15 percent too try and combat obesity as well as introduce a soft drink tax 
-I propose putting subsidies on family farms, Small Businesses, pharmaceuticals and towards the manufacturing industry 
-put more investment into education and infrastructure 
-use natural gas and coal revenue too create a dividend of 1,550 Dollars for all West Virginian citizens 20 years old and older as a way too help with poverty and unemployment 
-subsidize and invest more into renewable energy 
-reform the zoning laws too try and get housing costs lowered as well as attempting too incentivize local government too repurpose city owned properties for housing and allow Ancillary  dwelling units and try too fight against corporate investment into single family homes and try too get more public and social housing as well as subsidized apartments 
-increase police training and establish a independent committee too investigate police instead of the police investigating themselves 
-raise teacher pay 
-subsidize community college too make it more affordable 
-increase minimum wage too 10.25 an hour 
-invest more into nuclear energy 
-invest more into cleaning up our water and invest more into natural parks 
-LGBTQ+ protections in the work place 
-I propose a 35 hour work week 
-improve worker rights in general like sick pay and longer maternity leave 
-increase parents authority in education as well as parents choice"|WestVirginia|2024|True|0

"This is a throwaway because I post here often and don’t want it tied to my account. I haven’t gone outside in weeks. I’m running low on groceries and there’s no safe time to go. I live next to a major street and looking out my window I’ve seen so many people treating this like a vacation. Big play dates, large gatherings of people all walking together in close quarters. 

I’m 25. I’m lucky that I still have a job I can work from home, but I don’t know if I’ll be laid off soon. I’m terrified to even get something like Instacart because my friend said she got postmates and her delivery person was coughing and looked visibly ill when she dropped off her food. 

I don’t want to die, guys. I really, really don’t. I’m terrified. My doctor told me in no uncertain terms I have to stay inside — for how long? Months, most likely. Maybe your outlook is that this is a bad flu and you’re going to be fine or that it’s a free country or whatever. But please, when you’re out there disregarding all these pleas for social distancing and hand washing and staying home if you’re sick...take a minute and think of me in my apartment, terrified and alone and running out of food.

I have so many hopes and dreams and I am a real, full person. I don’t want to die. You can help save my life, and many others. So please.

"I want to have a rational discussion about the choice to mandate all restaurants and bars close.

tl;dr My question is, is it worth the economic hardship on our working and middle class to do something that really doesn't help the people truly under threat?

Things I am not: not a Trump supporter whatsoever and not saying his admin's response has been anything but awful, not advocating for people to ignore basic precautions, not saying anyone's life 'doesn't matter'

We know Covid19 affects about 80% of the population much like the flu...symptoms will be minor or non-existant for some, mild-moderate for others. In the high-risk groups, which we have identified and know how to protect, symptoms for Covid19 are again much like the flu. High risk groups can be a severe infection and without proper care die.

We need to start thinking about the cause/effect of our decisions more clearly, imho

Yes, closing restaurants will inarguably have \*some\* effect of slowing down infection...slowing down, but by how much? Is it going to protect high-risk groups more?

***There's no causal link between closing restaurants and lowering fatalities and severe cases among the high risk groups.*** 

Everywhere seniors and other high-risk people live is under lockdown with precautions in place. If someone is dumb enough to not take precautions now before they contact a high-risk person, closing restaurants won't make them less-dumb. There's no cause-effect...just the vague impression of it because of hysteria.

My question is, is it worth the economic hardship on our working and middle class to do something that really doesn't help the people truly under threat?"|Portland|2020|True|0
"I am so fucked. My partner was exposed to the disease, and I likely have it. I can’t breathe, and every resource says to avoid emergency rooms and urgent care if you think you are infected. WHERE DO I GO? WHO DO I CALL? I could not get a virtual visit with anyone anywhere. This is a nightmare.

UPDATE: so i said fuck it and went to the ER. They tested me for the flu, and after that was ruled out they drew blood and submitted the coronavirus test. It’s unclear when I’ll get my results back. They gave me rescue inhalers and hooked me up to a breathing treatment. AND, there was a surprise bonus to going to the ER: turns out I was allergic to the antibiotic I was prescribed by another doctor, who thought all this was a bacterial infection. The feeling of being choked was an anaphylactic response. So going to the ER may have saved my ass twice. Thank you so much to everyone who responded, telling me to do exactly this."|Portland|2020|True|1
"### PCC Public Relations & Community Engagement <PCC-Community-Engagement@pcc.edu> 

4:37 PM (37 minutes ago)to current\_students 📷

Dear Students,

Portland Community College knows that the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) throughout Oregon is of concern to our students, staff and community. PCC is committed to providing a safe and healthy educational environment, and recognizes the way we provide service may need to shift for a time in response to recommendations from the Governor, Oregon Health Authority, public health officials, Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help slow the rate of exposure and potential illness.

**The state does not recommend that Oregon’s colleges close at this time, and PCC will stay open and operational.** From a business and services continuity standpoint, the college has made operational decisions in response to the COVID-19 uptick. These decisions were made in the best interest of our students, faculty and staff, both to reduce the risk and spread of the illness and to maintain continuity of instruction and services.

Effective immediately,

* PCC will move toward a higher level of response that continues necessary operations of the college but that seeks to reduce the frequency of in person interactions among students, faculty, staff and visitors throughout our campuses, centers and facilities.
* Our goal is to maintain college operations and exercise social distancing, defined by the[ Centers for Disease Control and Protection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) (CDC) as avoiding crowds and mass public gatherings. In so doing, we are continuing to follow guidelines set by the CDC, the[ Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx), and our local county public health agencies.
* PCC campuses and centers will remain open to serve students. In the spirit of social distancing, we encourage you to contact us by phone or email, however, we’ll be here in person, as well. Please note that some services may be impacted or modified due to staff absences or to improve access for students during this time.

**Now, how do these decisions impact you? And what can you do to stay informed?**

*First and importantly -* ***regularly check your PCC.edu email for updates and critical information***. This is the way that the college will be connecting with you. MyPCC Announcements also will be used to communicate critical information.

Below is initial information that addresses the operations changes and available support that you can expect in the upcoming weeks. Follow-up communications, with more details and guidance, will be coming your way next week. *Again, check your PCC.edu email and MyPCC frequently!* 

**Finals Week (the Week of March 16):**

* *Reach out directly to your instructors* to ask questions related to your final exam(s).
* Faculty, if they haven’t already done so, have been encouraged to find alternative ways to offer final exams other than in-person.
* Faculty have been asked to relax proctoring procedures and practices as often as possible, enabling students to finish the Winter Term. 
* Should in-person finals need to take place, they will take place as scheduled.
* All college service areas - including food pantries and other [support resources](https://www.pcc.edu/student-leadership/services/free-resources/) \- will be open. 

**Spring Break Week (the Week of March 23):**

* All college service areas - including food pantries and other [support resources](https://www.pcc.edu/student-leadership/services/free-resources/) \- will be open for business. Note that many communications with service areas can happen remotely - via phone, email, or even “chat” in some departments. Check PCC.edu for information on specific department hours and services.   

**Spring Term:**

* For the first three weeks of Spring Term -- through Friday, April 17 -- *instruction for traditional, face-to-face classes will be offered remotely, using college-supported technology to assist remote teaching (Google Hangouts, etc.).* During this time period students will not be required to come to a campus or center for instruction.  
* There will be some, limited, courses that must meet in person. For these, we will do everything we can to adhere to social distancing best practices in the learning environment on campus.
* *Regularly check your PCC.edu email* for explicit directions and guidance from your instructors about your Spring Term classes. This will be sent as early as the week of March 16.
* The start date for spring term, as well as published add, drop, and payment due dates will not change. See the [Academic Calendar ](https://www.pcc.edu/enroll/registration/academic-calendar.html)for more information on key dates.
* We are working on requiring that all classes have a syllabus and introductory statement on how instruction will take place for your class during the first three weeks posted in Brightspace (D2L). This does NOT mean all classes are “online.” The consistent use of Brightspace to post a syllabus and communicate the instructional delivery plan will ease this adjustment during this time. **Please become familiar with PCC’s** [**Student Online Learning Resource**](https://www.pcc.edu/online/students/) **if you are unfamiliar with Brightspace.**  
* Computers will remain available in the libraries and labs for use by students for the online, remote delivery of classes. Hours for these resources will be adjusted to accommodate need for access by students. Please check the[ library website](https://www.pcc.edu/library/) for updated hours.
* The college will make a decision on Wednesday, April 15 about returning to regularly scheduled, in-person classes for the rest of Spring Term. Again, more information to come -- *check your PCC.edu email and MyPCC Announcements*.

We will continue to update[ the college's coronavirus website](https://www.pcc.edu/coronavirus/) on PCC.edu, so please remember to regularly check it for new information. And similar to our operations for inclement weather, updates will be posted on PCC.edu and via[ PCC Alerts](https://www.pcc.edu/public-safety/safety-alerts-and-timely-warnings/), among other communication channels should a closure become necessary.

And here is a reminder of the  best preventative measures for COVID-19 that we encourage you to follow:

* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds with warm, soapy water or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, especially after using the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Stay home when you are sick. If you’re sick with flu-like symptoms, plan to stay home until you are symptom-free (as in, no fever) for 24 hours. 

Following are links we’ve shared in previous communications for helpful background. You also can call the state’s general information number, 211.

This is truly an unprecedented and evolving situation, and we greatly appreciate your support, grace and effort to protect the health of our college community."|Portland|2020|True|0
"This is not just the flu, its on a whole different level, and people are looking at me like I'm crazy for wearing a mask on a crowded bus. (yes masks DO help despite what so disinformation would have you believe)  Here are three studies that prove it. Yet nobody is wearing them. People are walking around coughing on everything without even covering their mouths, or if they do cover their mouths they aren't doing it properly. No consideration to the fact they might be spreading a virus to people who can die from it. Nobody cares. Schools are still open, churches are open, concerts are open, no testing is being done. In two months our entire hospital system is going to be overrun if people keep on like this. Put a freaking mask on people or stay home. You can spread this whether you feel sick or not. Its already here. You might have it. The time for business as usual has passed. Take 20 minutes away from your instagrams and do a deep dive into this virus and then stop acting like its just the flu and there's no reason not to go out this weekend. Our government isn't going to act until its too late obviously so its up to us to change our behaviors. Come on Portland, you are smarter than this.

"“PSA regarding COVID-19: A Warning

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic and misinformation by arming you with sourced knowledge, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from outbreak zones such as Seattle, Australia, and the LA area. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now ready yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through [Herculean efforts](https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1237020518781460480).

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [100,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep. That means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186). 

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and possibly breathing as well** (*see bullet point below*). But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[NOT PEER REVIEWED]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing as well. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: ""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now."" [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer. Also please note that this study has not been peer-reviewed, but due to the implications is included here out of an abundance of caution.)

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.**

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)--especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world and has [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients. [Toronto Star soberly warns hospitals can’t cope if coronavirus outbreak worsens in Canada: March 6th.](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/06/hospitals-warn-they-cant-cope-if-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-in-canada.html)

* A surgeon working in the heart of Italy's outbreak gives a harrowing testimony and urges everyone to heed the warning that it can easily overwhelm hospitals ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffa2tf/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/fjx5tc8/) / [Original](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)).

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

* People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html))

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. Follow the streps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper).  The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* Practice social distancing.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO.

* Carry disinfectant with you.

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* If you have extra face masks, consider donating some to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months. Masks in the right hands is to your benefit, as they slow the spread. Hoarded masks are actually detrimental to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitaizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Always remember the top three: Disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine. 

([Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/)) 

#**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China.)

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include those who meet *any* of the following conditions:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart, lung or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking/vaping](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""** Additional: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source.](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds))

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf))

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* It's still far too early to know for sure, but the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is estimated to be 0.94% (0.37%–2.9% with a 95% CI) ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Though [here](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) is a recent Slate piece that mentions a CFR between 0.2 to 0.4. South Korea, after doing 140,000 tests, reports a CFR of 0.6% ([source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html))

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, as SARS-like virus can have long-term consequences: ""Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: says a [15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5)"". And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal--that and I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, which will always be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).

"Since they’re not telling us anything or testing anyone... let’s at least round up some anecdotes. 

- One friend has self quarantined; has all the symptoms. Male 30s in SE. No test. 

- Friend’s coworker has the symptoms; called hospital and they told her not to come to hospital or to call in advance if she comes to ER. (?!) Got conflicting info from another nurse. My friend called to find out what to do about the office and the nurse was totally flippant (“do whatever you would do if she had the flu.”)

"Call me crazy, a prepper, or any other name, but I think it is time we flood our leaders inboxes with demands for action. Sure, they are more or less hogtied due to our nations ineptness, but sitting on your hands while people attend large events on the daily is insanity.

The numbers speak for themselves and we only have so many beds in hospitals. This is going to be bad and Kate needs to stand up and urge her constituents to take the necessary measures. Bills need to be crafted where defaults on loans are wiped during these type of crisis and so forth. People are going around acting like this is the flu when I know when my dad gets this, he will be fucked.

Please, for the good of our community, raise your voice. Email your local and state reps. Sure, it is already here, but we are far too reactive.

Last week my son came down with cold or flu-like symptoms but nothing horrendous.   He missed one day of work.   Friday I started coughing and by Saturday felt like death warmed over.  I went to a clinic and tested positive for Influenza A. We live with a 71 year old who by Saturday was coughing and having trouble breathing.  He got to the point where we called 911.  The first responders came in, worked on my sick friend and I mentioned that I had Influenza A.  All 5 of them slapped face masks on right away.  After they left we were thinking that out of consideration for them when we called 911 we should have mentioned there was flu in our home so the paramedics could have masked up before entering.  They are true heroes.  Imagine walking into a strange home not knowing what germs or viruses linger in there.  I don’t think I could do it but love the first responders who will without question.  Woohoo first responders!|Portland|2020|True|1
"First of all, some info:
- I go to high school in Galveston County
- I have COVID and so does my friend (I’ll call them A)
- A is asymptomatic and I’m not

I had some friends over Saturday and started showing symptoms Monday afternoon and I told them to get tested and quarantine, they do, everyone is negative except A. We both reported our positive tests to the school, I’m quarantined until either a negative test or Tuesday after next and A isn’t quarantined at all. If A doesn’t go to school they’ll be given unexcused absences for something out of their control, if A does go they’ll put students and faculty (many of which are upper 50s and 60s) into harms way. A shouldn’t have to make that choice. At a time when COVID is soaring nobody is required to contact trace, wear masks, or even quarantine. This is obvious neglect, the school does not care about us in the slightest and only wants us up there instead of wanting us healthy and safe, which you think would be a to priority of a school in a less fortunate area. The only thing the school cares about is if we’re present and presentable, nothing else. What is supposed to be a voice of authority in our lives shouldn’t be forcing tough lose-lose situations to a group of teens.

Meet Shiny, a super sweet soft and fluffy kitty who needs a home! He is a stray that would sure love to come inside. He is fully tame but is unfortunately bullied by the other stray I have rescued, otherwise I would keep him. I have gotten him fixed, flea treated and dewormed and up to date on all vaccinations. He is estimated to be 4 years old and weighs 12 lbs. He has spent a little time inside and is a bit nervous but doesn’t howl and seems pretty happy. He loves pets and cuddles and will drool up a storm when he gets attention. He is FIV positive but has no symptoms and should be able to live a fairly normal life. |Portland|2024|True|0

# Abolish the death penalty.

Humans are fallible, we’ll never get the right answer 100&#37; of the time. 4&#37; of the people on death row are not guilty of a crime and have been wrongly convicted. A system that puts innocent people to death is indefensible and should be reformed. We want justice for the American people but killing innocent people on death row is the exact opposite.

# Enact common-sense gun regulation

92&#37; of Americans want expanded background checks, 54&#37; want a ban on assault weapons, and 54&#37; want a ban on high capacity magazines. We agree with the majority of the American people and support these measures. Over 30,000 Americans die every year from gun violence, including over 10,000 homicides. The time to act is now to address this public health crisis.

# Combat homelessness

More than 600,000 Americans are homeless on any given night, including over 57,000 veterans. Studies show the cost of leaving a homeless person on the streets is $30,000 while the cost of housing them is just $10,000. Addressing this crisis is both the moral and fiscally responsible thing to do.

# Enact police reform

We believe in the core idea of policing — to serve and protect the community. Police are a vital part of American society and that is why it’s so important to reform the system to make it serve all Americans. For\-profit policing and for\-profit prisons should be abolished. Police training should be retooled to emphasize deescalation tactics, and body cameras should be mandatory on all officers. Furthermore, community oversight boards should be created and broken windows policing should be eliminated. Stop & frisk — which disproportionately targets blacks and latinos 87&#37; of the time — has a 97&#37; failure rate. On top of being discriminatory and ineffective, it’s also unconstitutional and should be ended. Special prosecutors must also be appointed to hold police accountable.

# Implement comprehensive immigration reform.

We won’t give an inch in our opposition to Trump’s outrageous proposals. Ideas like a ‘total and complete’ shutdown of Muslim immigration and deporting all undocumented immigrants are anathema to America. We will fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. America is a proud nation of immigrants.

# Protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid

Republicans have been trying to privatize and cut earned benefit programs for decades. Corporate Democrats have been willing to go along with them under the guise of a ‘grand bargain’ and ‘reform’. We pledge to staunchly oppose this. Social Security reduced the elderly poverty rate from 35&#37; to 10&#37;. 3.4 million Americans would immediately fall into poverty without Medicaid. Gutting these vital programs is not an option.

# Ensure paid vacation time, sick time, family leave, childcare.

The United States is one of just three countries in the world that doesn’t offer paid maternity leave, the others being Oman and Papua New Guinea. We are the only industrialized nation that doesn’t offer paid vacation time. This should be changed immediately.

# Defend and protect women’s rights.

We support the Paycheck Fairness Act. We oppose Republican cuts to Planned Parenthood and women’s health clinics all across the country. In 2016 alone, 60 TRAP laws targeting abortion were passed in 19 states. We will vigorously oppose all efforts to dismantle reproductive rights.

# No Longer Sell Arms To Human-Rights Violators

Ban arming human rights violators. We recently gave Saudi Arabia billions in weapons and watched the civilian death toll in their vicious bombing campaign in Yemen tick up. We continue sending Egypt arms as they violently crack down on peaceful protesters. Israel received $38 billion in aid and promptly announced new settlements. The first step to peace is not enabling nations who regularly violate international law. We must be bold enough to stand up to human rights violators who aren’t just our enemies, but our allies. We don’t weaken our allies by holding them accountable, we strengthen them.

# End constitutional overreaches.

Ban the NSA from bulk data\-collection and warrantless spying. Shut down Guantanamo Bay and all extrajudicial prisons. Prosecute torturers and those who violated the Geneva Conventions, Nuremberg Tribunal, International law and US law. Return habeas corpus and due process. Pardon whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. We shouldn’t be leading from behind on human rights, we must be the home of liberty. We should practice the values we preach.

# Block bad trade deals like the TPP and oppose outsourcing that will further damage the middle-class.

As a result of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China and the WTO, Americans have lost millions of decent paying jobs. It’s time to end the race to the bottom and renegotiate these rigged deals that only benefit elites. We should not sacrifice our sovereignty, the only people who are allowed to make laws for the United States should be the American people, not multinational corporations.

# Ensure Universal Education as a Right

Educating the citizenry of a nation pays dividends in the long run, with the economy getting back much more than is initially put in. Crushing student debt for higher education would no longer burden young men and women trying to improve their lives through hard work. We should strive to have the best education system in the world.

# Create the Renewable Energy Revolution

Scientists are sounding the alarm on climate change. In order to avoid the worst case scenario and a dystopian future we need a massive green revolution. It’s time to drastically and immediately move away from fossil fuels and develop the technologies of the future. This will be a giant boon to both the private and public sector, as well as a necessary response to a global crisis. We can and we must be #1 in sustainable energy production in the world.

# Create the New New Deal

Our infrastructure gets a grade of D from the Society of Civil Engineers. The government should invest trillions in rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, schools, levees, airports etc. There’s no reason why we can’t have the world’s #1 infrastructure.

# End the Failed War on Drugs

The goal is legalization, taxation, and regulation. Prohibition only makes drug cartels more powerful, increases crime, and makes drugs more dangerous due to lack of enforced safety standards. What you put in your body is your own business, and your right. A free society should allow individuals to make their own choices about their bodies. While most users are recreational and moderate, rehabilitation and treatment should be provided for people struggling with addiction. Additionally, those serving time for non\-violent drug offenses should be pardoned.

# End Unnecessary Wars and Nation Building

The United States maintains 800 military bases worldwide at a cost of $100 billion a year. This is money that can be spent at home creating jobs, rebuilding infrastructure, and investing in the future of the people. The disastrous war in Iraq cost trillions, the war in Afghanistan is 15 years in with no end in sight, and we’re currently bombing 7 different countries. We spend more on our military than the next 8 countries combined. Despite countless lives lost and destroyed, terrorism has only gotten worse. It’s time to end the wars and the perverse monetary\-incentive structure that makes politicians flippant about sending young men and women to die. Unilateral U.S. military force should only be used as a last resort to defend the nation. The current budget could be cut drastically if we used our department of defense for what it was intended—defending us, instead of waging interventionist wars.

# Ensure Healthcare is a Universal Right

The United States should catch up to every other modern nation and implement a single\-payer, medicare\-for\-all system. There’s no reason we can’t be #1 in the world instead of #37. It’s time to end the destruction of American healthcare by rapacious, price gouging, for\-profit, private health insurance middlemen.

# Secure a Living Wage, and Tie it to Inflation

This is about justice and basic human decency. If you work hard and you work full time you shouldn’t live in poverty. Furthermore, we support strong unions and collective bargaining.

# Oppose Bigotry

We must speak out against racism, sexism, xenophobia, and all forms of bigotry. Non\-discrimination protections that currently apply to race, religion, and gender should be expanded to include the LGBTQ community and the atheist community. Making all Americans equal is not asking for special privileges, it’s asking for the rule of law—justice and equality for all as outlined in the United States Constitution.

# End Tax Dodging and Loopholes

Corporations dodge $450 billion a year in taxes by using offshore tax havens. We should end this injustice, as well as chain the capital gains tax to the income tax, increase the estate tax, and implement the Buffet Rule so that no millionaire CEO pays less in taxes than his or her secretary. It’s time for a tax system that benefits the middle\-class and the poor, and makes the top 1&#37; and multinational corporations pay their fair share.

# Abolish ICE

ICE was created in 2003 as a reaction to 9/11. Since then, it has turned into a state\-funded terror group that regularly violates basic human rights. We don't need a special enforcement agency for undocumented immigrants. We can rely on our existing criminal justice agency to arrest those who have committed a crime, just like we did before 2003.

# These ideas represent what the Democratic Party was supposed to represent all along.

Opinion polls in the United States demonstrate that these policy positions are overwhelmingly popular. Indeed, throughout the industrialized world these ideas are considered moderate. This is a movement about freedom and justice. And it’s a movement by and for working people. If the Democrats refuse to embrace this platform, they’ll continue to lose, either to Republicans or to us. The future of the Democratic party is the Justice wing, not the establishment wing.

"**Covid Preparedness Update Part 4: Vaccines, Variants, and Masks**

In the last 6 months, we’ve seen vaccine roll out, and life started to return to a semblance of normal. Mask mandates have been lifted for the vaccinated, cases are relatively low, and our hospitals weren’t overflowing anymore. And then Delta happened. Vaccine mandates are being initiated, people are starting to talk about mask mandates being reinstated, returns to the office are being delayed, the AAP recommends masking kids in schools for the next year, and new waves of Covid are starting to crest, despite it being summer time. 

**So let’s talk Variants.** 

First, it’s important to understand how viruses evolve. Every single time a virus copies itself, it tries to copy its genetic material as exactly as possible. However, it will make mistakes every now and then. Those mistakes, or mutations, can lead to changes in the structure of the virus. Sometimes those mutations might make it weaker. Some might make it more infectious. Or less infectious. Or more deadly. Or less deadly. It’s completely random. 

However, evolution is driven by something called “selective pressure.” That means that random mutations that let the virus reproduce better will probably end up reproducing more. Thus, we should see those mutations becoming more common overtime. Covid variants that we hear about on the news, such as Delta, are versions of the virus that spread more easily. Delta is much more contagious than the original strain that started circulating in 2019, due to mutations in the spike protein (the part that binds to our cells). 

In addition, the viral load in infected people is much higher, regardless of vaccination status. The implications of this are unclear, but it would stand to reason that more virus being exhaled would mean that there is an increased chance of catching Covid outdoors, if in a crowded setting. In addition, masks may be less effective, due to viroid particles escaping around the edges in higher numbers. I would recommend using an N95, and changing it after each usage as opposed to a cloth mask, if you have the means. Costco online has relatively affordable KN95's and N95's in bulk. 

**So why does this matter?**

Let’s talk about immunity, both vaccinated and natural immunity. When someone is infected with the virus, their body is exposed to all the parts of the virus. The spike protein, nucleocapsid proteins, etc.) Our immune system builds antibodies to those proteins, so the next time we are exposed, we can fight it off before getting infected again. Current data suggests that natural infection results in long lasting immunity, even after serum antibodies fade. So your immune system stores a memory of the infection, which is ready to go on exposure, even up to a year later (and maybe beyond). https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-immunity-vaccine-no-infection-parties

The way the vaccines work is to expose us to the genetic instructions to make spike protein. Our cells make some spike protein without the rest of the virus, so we can build antibodies that recognize spike when we are exposed to the virus, ideally not getting infected. Similarly to natural infection, we should develop a long-lasting immunity after a full vaccination course. The jury is still out on whether fully vaccinated individuals will need booster shots to maintain that immunity to the original Coronavirus strain, but the US plans to roll out booster shots soon, to try and combat delta. 

HOWEVER, both natural infection during 2019 and most of 2020, as well as the vaccinations build antibodies towards the ORIGINAL version of spike protein. As covid mutates around the globe, some of those new variants have spike proteins that look a bit different than it originally did. Sometimes, that is different enough that antibodies from original infection or vaccination won’t recognize it very well, or maybe not even at all. This is called an immune escape variant. 

Breakthrough cases occur when someone who is vaccinated against Covid gets infected anyways. Sometimes, that’s just because their bodies didn’t properly mount an immune response (it didn’t work). This was previously estimated to be somewhere around 5% of people. However, variants like Delta are much better at infecting vaccinated people. Because this virus is more “fit” than other versions, being both more contagious and being able to infect vaccinated and previously infected people at a higher rate than the other variants (the exact numbers are still out on this, though current CDC estimates are 66%), my advice would be that people should not drop precautions entirely. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm

**So, I’m vaccinated/immune, even if I do get infected with Delta, it’ll be mild, right? So why bother wearing masks or still being cautious? The unvaccinated had their chance, screw em!**

At present, the vaccine is still not approved for children under 12. Even though it seems that most children have mild infections, some do not. Additionally, the long-term complications of Covid infection in children are still largely unknown. However, children who have had Covid are being diagnosed with diabetes at a higher rate, and many children also develop Misc-C and Kawasaki. 

There is also a percentage of the population who cannot get vaccinated due to allergies, and many who are immunocompromised, which can lead to the vaccine not being as effective. 

As for the willingly unvaccinated/nonimmune, it’s true that they have had ample opportunities to get vaccinated. There are a variety of reasons that people may choose not to get vaccinated. Some may not have days off of work to deal with side effects. Some may be afraid of future health complications due to the vaccine being a new technology. Some may know people who have had bad reactions. And some may have no reason whatsoever other than they don’t want to be told what to do. Regardless of the reasons, new variants put us back a few steps. 

Both unvaccinated/nonimmune people (and to a significant degree, vaccinated and immune) people can transmit Delta. It can be transmitted to children, immunocompromised, and those who can’t or won’t get vaccinated, in addition to other vaccinated people. And they can keep transmitting it. Every single infection is a chance for further mutations that can escape immune response. Every single person who avoids infection by avoiding large gatherings, continuing to wear a mask, and getting tested if they feel ill or suspect exposure is helping to protect the vulnerable, and protecting humanity against future variants.

**Is it all over then? What else can we do? Are we all destined to get Covid?**

There is significant data that improving your general health can drastically reduce infection and improve Covid outcomes. Making sure you're not Vitamin D deficient (or deficient in anything, really), can have a huge impact. Get exercise, be fit and healthy. A huge proportion of Covid deaths and severe disease are among people who have comorbidities, or other health issues. So if you have any health issues that can be improved through a healthier lifestyle, improving your chances against Covid is another big reason to start making those changes."|NewYorkCity|2021|True|0

Here’s something that has been bugging me for awhile. There are several temporary no parking signs on my girlfriend’s street for no apparent reason, eliminating several potential spaces on an already crowded street. With a simple google search, I found that I could buy identical signage for a few dollars. A phone call to PBOT yielded no results except vague advise to look on the website and the promise that my inquiry would be “passed along.” There must be a system in place where folks with a legitimate timely interest can apply for parking to be blocked off for a period of time. However, I’m wondering if this is one of those cases, or some random neighbor who’s sick of having cars parked in front of his house and hoping no one calls him on it. Another possibility; there is a renovation company that appears to be doing some intermittent work on one of the houses (whenever they get around to it). Anyone have any insight on determining legitimacy of parking restriction signs, or is this process as opaque as the rest of government?|Portland|2017|True|0
"I've been in Portland about a year now and so far haven't had too many negative experiences with native Portlanders. Tonight, however, I was at a friends house in Southeast and parked my car a few houses away. My cousin left to grab something from the nearby dispensary and on his way back saw a neighbor throwing eggs at my car. When he asked him, ""Are you throwing eggs at that car?"" He exclaimed, ""Yeah I am! Fuck you liberal hipsters.""

My cousin came back to the party to tell me what had happened and I didn't really grasp the situation that well. I thought he was just being high. When I went to check it out the guy was waiting at his front porch smoking a cigarette. Trying to understand the situation I asked if there was a problem and he instantly snapped at me yelling, ""Fuck you New York hipster. Don't park your fucking car in front of my house."" Well shit this guy was serious. In an attempt to reason with him I asked why he would throw eggs at my car. ""Fuck you, you liberal piece of shit."" Totally thrown off I asked why he would be acting like this and he followed by complaining, ""I'm sick of you fucking up the traffic. Go fuck yourself.""

"When I was little in the early 90s, I was a pretty sick kid and was in the ER a lot. At the time, they used to give kids these teddy bears made from like quilting cotton, and I seem to remember they were made by volunteers. I had quite the collection when I decided to donate them back, a couple of trash bags full of them. 

I’d forgotten about them until a bit ago. 

Does anyone else remember these? Do they still do this? A quick search only turned up donations for Christmas during quarantine, and they had to be new and unwrapped for kids who were admitted. I was under 10, so I don’t remember a lot of details about the program, but I remember the bears having a lot of impact for me.

"Dear Mr. French,


As a school speech-language pathologist, I am beyond disheartened to hear of the canceling of contact tracing and surveillance testing. I understand that Omicron moves quickly and that these methods are not foolproof in preventing the spread, but they are a layer of protection that has brought a level of security to our schools. The proposed guidance would have only unvaccinated students and staff complete rapid testing. What about those of us who are vaccinated? I am vaccinated and have the booster, but I still appreciate my weekly surveillance test because it ensures that I am not working with students while positive and asymptomatic. If the weekly testing ends, alternative measures must be put in place for vaccinated individuals who may be spreading Omicron willy-nilly without knowing it! Additionally, putting the burden of testing on parents means that there will without a doubt be fewer total tests. Parents may be too busy, less informed on the science, or otherwise unwilling to do the required testing. COVID cases WILL be even more undercounted as a result of this decision. 


Another reason this change in guidance is particularly troubling to me is that, as a special education provider, I work closely with children who are more likely to have comorbidity and be at higher risk. At times, I provide articulation therapy, which can be challenging even with clear masks, which do not provide the same level of protection as a KN95. It is also harder for me to do my job while maintaining proper distance and safety protocols. The loss of weekly testing means that I might be spreading COVID to high-risk students, potentially putting their lives in danger. This is unacceptable. 


I'd like to believe that the department's guidance is based solely on science and regard for others, but given my experiences in the schools and research on the virus, I have a sinister suspicion that the decision was at least partially made based on convenience, a desire to save money, and the need to suppress case counts to further ensure that schools do not close, no matter what. I really, really hope this isn't the case, but the administration has consistently been dropping the ball and ignoring science since last fall. Prove me wrong, Mr. French. Show that your main concern isn't money after all, but a real desire to follow the science. You claim to speak for teachers and how burdened we are by contract tracing. Well, you aren't listening to us, and you don't speak for us. We are begging you to actually help us and our students. We will remember the results of your action or inaction, and you will be judged accordingly.

He either received a false positive from the ClearChoice test or the virus ran its entire course while we were waiting for the results.

He always speaks very fondly of going on vacation in the summer to Tawas, generally around his birthday. It was the part of his childhood that was good, before his dad got sick and died. He'll be 40 this year and is not looking forward to it, so I wanted to take him up there as a gift. Anywhere is fine, but I was really hoping to figure out which ones he stayed at as a kid. The problem is, all I know is a vague detail - it had an arcade. And this was in the mid to late 80s, so wouldn't everywhere have had one? I know they were separate cottages with kitchens, and that's it. I don't know if it was on Tawas Lake or on Huron itself, either. He just refers to it as ""Tawas."" 

He's also very intuitive and clever so if I try to ask any leading questions, he's going to have it figured out in about 10 seconds flat, so I'm trying not to show my hand here.

"As you all may or may not know, the ""stay home"" in Michigan order does not apply to healthcare workers. Now yea, some employers are decent, but other's like my mom's? Trash. She's a Nurse Manager in a assisted living facility. They literally have had under the bear minimum amount of PPE for ~ 2 months now. 
All the staff keep calling off because they are scared of getting Covid, so my mom always goes in and takes care of some of the residents herself. Two of them had Pneumonia, and they only allow PPE to be used for covid now, so she used a cloth mask she had, but it wasn't enough. 
A couple days later she started spiking a high fever, fatigue, cough, and severe muscle pain -- ALL common symptoms of covid.   She immediately quarantines and gets tested so she doesn't get this high risk population sick. roughly a week later, the test comes back negative and they do a chest x-ray and find pneumonia. 

Now her work is threatening to terminate her because she took time off and it wasn't due to covid after all. What, they wanted her to come in with Pneumonia and a fever of 102 F?  

Anyway, she talked them down from that- but the big deal is that she NEEDS a letter from a doctor or the department of health stating she had  covid symptoms (note: not diagnosed, just symptoms) and thus was required to quarantine for that one week prior to her testing coming back negative for Covid. 

This is really important, because my mom was going to have pre-cancerous breast cells removed early April, but it was cancelled due to the COVID outbreak. Her work states that without a letter stating she had covid-like symptoms and was urged to quarantine, if she chooses to go though with surgery in her reschedule for june to get half her breast taken out, she will be terminated since this technically wasn't covid.

I am SO SO frustrated for her!!! Why do SOMES Employers in Michigan ( and the rest of states too) treat their helathcare workers like trash??? It's because THEY don't have enough PPE that she has Pneumonia. Not only do you refuse to count this as a work related illness, but you'll terminate her if she gets breast surgery due to CANCER? 

Now, I'm a covid case investigator in MA. I'm epidemiology trained and sit in on a lot of employment calls that help people be excused due to covid symptoms here in Mass. It's frustrating I can't help my own mother get a simple later stating she was required to quarantine due to covid potential.

"My mother was complaining about how Whitmer's plan is way too overbearing (they are the types who would have been in Lansing protesting...).  This is light of she has TWO daughter in laws who work in hospitals dealing with COVID on a daily basis.  After complaining about how they can't get potting soil, she told me about a story of our uncle who has some property in Gladwin.  He is a high-risk individual and his wife works for Meijer.  To avoid becoming sick, he left town and went up north to 'quarantine'.  He has comes back a couple times for medications, supplies and such.

Here is where the story gets interesting.  He said he received a text message from the state warning him to stop travelling and receives a phone call from Lansing.  The person starts interrogating my uncle asking him a series of questions about why he is travelling and that he is violating the SAH order.  After explaining to them the circumstances, the official explains that he might get arrested.  If that happens, he will have to show up to court and explain himself to a judge.

Has anyone encountered this speaking to the surveillance aspect?  I assume the surveillance is based on license plate trackers and the state references their other databases to identify people who appear to 'travel'.   Is his story BS?  I can't find any news story that would corroborate the story saying this is a thing."|Michigan|2020|True|0

"With all the negativity about the shutdown, what have you noticed that's changed for the better? On a personal level, I've enjoyed cooking more and not having as much stress with traveling for work. But for all of society there are a few things I hope we can keep after this:

\- Letting small breweries deliver beer and self-distribute. It should be expanded to allow shipping within the state, and ideally outside the state for beer, wine, and liquor producers.

\- Wearing masks. It doesn't look or feel weird anymore, and would be a good thing to see more people wearing them during flu season.

\- PTO. Should be available for all so workers don't have to come into work sick.

\- Preparedness and sanitation. I think people realizing having some food (and toilet paper) on hand is a good thing, and how important hand washing and cleaning common surfaces is. I really hope that continues."|Michigan|2020|True|0

"Really, really sick of this person and their bullshit, but they've told me they'll leave when they want to, not when I say.  So it's time to take the legal option.

I know they qualify as a tenant since they've stayed so long and have a key, but I can't find the correct notice online to get them out, since all the ones I can find are for landlords evicting tenants with contracts for nonpayment of rent and damage of property. 

So I have a lot of questions.  Does anyone know where I can find an eviction notice that works for kicking out a month-to-month tenant not for lease breaking, but just for being an asshole?  Or if I write one myself and send it to them by email, is it legally binding, or does it have to have very specific wording?

As a side note, the landlady doesn't know they're there, and I'd like to keep it that way.  I'd rather this not end with me getting tossed out myself for having an unlicensed tenant, since they were  never supposed to be one."|Philadelphia|2018|True|0
"**Have you ever had, or suspected you had, an infection with dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus or have you been vaccinated against yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis virus?** 

If so, we invite you to participate in a research study at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (PVAMC). 

These viruses are transmitted by mosquitos, cause flu-like symptoms, and are found globally in the tropics and subtropics. For more information about arthropod borne viruses (arboviruses), please visit: 

[http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/](http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/)

With your participation, we will be able to learn about the human immune response to arbovirus infections and how that response changes over time. We hope to one day translate these findings into the development of safe and effective vaccines. 

To qualify for participation you must: 

o Be between 18 and 93 years of age 

o Have lived in or traveled to tropical or sub-tropical regions in the past **and** 

o Have had a confirmed or suspected infection with dengue, chikungunya, Zika, or a related arbovirus, **or**

o Have received the yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis vaccine(s)

o Not be currently anemic 

This is research, not treatment.

Participation involves a travel/medical history questionnaire and a small blood draw. If first blood test is consistent with past virus exposure, a second blood draw may be performed. You will receive a $20 gift card with each blood draw.

"Background story ahead, see TL;DR for question

Late last year I moved into a rental unit on a one year lease. The unit is pretty old and run down but functional. I was left alone until the first inspection six months in (recently). The landlord and agent attended this inspection. During the inspection the landlord was talking about various changes he wanted to make in the bathroom. He decided he wanted to repaint the bathroom to paint over some mold stains on the ceiling that were persistently beginning to regrow some mold. He and the agent told me that the landlord would come on the same day as the painter to redo the grout in the bath/shower and change the toilet seat to a new one. Fine. I take a day off for the painters and the owner doesn't show up on the day. The painters use oil based paint and the house is poorly ventilated (bathroom window doesn't open all the way and its next to the bedroom) so I breath the fumes for several days while it airs out.

The agent emails me the same day saying the owner wants to come the next day instead to look at the paintjob. I say can he please come on saturday morning. He agrees. On saturday morning the owner attends and brings his wife. His wife looks around the place and asks me personal questions that I politely endure. He ends up not changing the grout, instead he sprays a basic cleaning solution on it and says it ""just needs to be left for an hour then cleaned, then he will see how it looks and go from there"" looking pointedly at me. Keeping in mind it is in MUCH cleaner condition than it was when I moved in. The tiles in the bath were filthy so this is not a new discovery. I say I'll follow his instructions and I'll send him photos (thinking I can keep him from coming yet again and move on).

Today, literally a few days later, I get yet another email from the agent, the landlord wishes to come by together with the agent and the painter to ""inspect the paint job"", on Monday or Wednesday next week. Didn;t he already come voer to inspect the paintjob? I agree to wednesday moring. This is annoying as I feel pressure to keep the place in inspection conditoon for these visits, and am spending my time after work during the week to do so, instead of having a break. I've been sick with the flu as well which has helped.

The entire time the agent is also sublty pressuring me and stressing how I don't HAVE to be there he can just let people in with the keys while I'm not home.

I am a very private person, and this my first time renting. I;m paying higher rent to rent by myself for a reason, and that is that I wish to be left alone. I keep the house reasonably clean and tidy, they ahd no complaints at the inspection and actually thaked me for keeping it in that state.

I have work six days a week including saturdays and I have been making requests at work to change my hours here or miss a day there to be here for these visits.

What recourse do I have? At what point are these visits considered excessive? This is the owners only investment property, and as his wife told me ""öur retirement fund"".  To me it seemed like he was planning to continue to slowly renovate or improve the place while I'm living there. He didnt show up as he advised me on teh agreed day with the painters and then said he would ""swing by"" the next day. I took a day off work for that and I can't be available at his beck and call. Further I'm female and young and dont wish to have strange men going through my home when Im not there.

Do I have to put up with this or am I being pushed around due to being a young person renting for the first time alone?

Also to me there is  a difference ebetween making aesthetic improvements and actual maintenance. His current issues have been purely aesthetic improvements, that he could have made before renting the place to a tenant and inconveniencing/ disturbing their privacy.

Further I'm going to be away for a week in early July, and at this rate (been having weekly/ bi -weekly visits, including twice in one week) they will want to b in the property while I'm away. This is not ok with me.

The final thing is I have a feeling I'm in for further repainting, as the apinter had plans to let the owner know of all the  ""areas he could do for a great price"". This will be an issue as I cnt miss more work but I dont want strangers in my home when Im not there. Or even when Im there trying to get some damn rest. Nor do I want mroe nasty fumes.

tl;dr: At point are landlords visits considered excessive and what is considered to be necessary maintenance? What can I do about this?"|melbourne|2018|True|0

"So I've been sick with Covid 19 for 4 weeks and I filed for Unemployment and was getting $832 a week because the $600 Stimulus Package was added to my $232.
I've gotten better now, despite being afraid of catching and spreading the Virus, I eventually went back to work at my Liquor Store. learned my hours were cut from 46 to 42 hours making my normal paycheck $356 instead of 406.
So basically how is it logical for me to work around tons of sick people, I've gotten no raise even though Liquor sales are through the roof, to work 42 hours a week while being unemployed almost triples that.  I don't think I qualify for a 46 to 42 hours becayse I'm still getting 40..

"TL;DR: Someone in the household is getting tested, doc says the whole house has to quarantine until results come back. My girlfriend's workplace won't let her leave. Anything I can do? 






*Massive Edit:* They are allowing her to leave after hours of arguing through text and on the phone. They said that she would be on a mandatory 14 day quarantine, regardless of test results, if she left work. 

The catch is that they are asking her to stay for 2 more hours because she is the only available person that can give medication. So they want her to touch the pills that are going into the patients' mouth (they don't have gloves)! When she asked them about that, they said ""you're the only one trained"" this place is a joke. 




So me and my girlfriend are living with my parents. My stepmom has become sick with a fever, and some other covid like symptoms. They are going to test her for the Covid-19 virus, but her doctor ordered that she and all people who have been staying in the house should quarantine until the results come back.

My girlfriend works at an assisted living type place where they have to be with their residents 24/7. I called her at work to tell her she should quarantine, but her workplace won't allow her to leave. They have been monitoring temperatures for a few days on all employees, and said as long as she doesn't get a fever she doesn't need to leave.

I feel that the company is putting their residents at risk by allowing someone who potentially is carrying the virus to continue to have physical contact with their residents (who are most certainly in the high risk category when it comes to Covid).

Is there anything she can do? She offered to provide paperwork from the doctor, but they ~~won't accept it~~ don't want her to send it. If she was to be fired, would that be unlawful termination? Any help is appreciated!

Edit: They are now telling her not to go home tonight, as if she has somewhere else to go, so that she won't be contaminated.

I went to another doctor today to try and get a referral to a specialist. She got very defensive when I said I had seen another doctor and already had a diagnosis. She angrily told me ""she was a great doctor"", (I had said nothing to suggest otherwise, I was literally describing my symptoms), and then said ""you've picked a great day for this"" because it's Sunday before ANZAC day. She refused to send me to a specialist and prescribed tests I've already gotten to tell me what I already know. This isn't the first time something like this has happened.

I'm in a kafkaesque sisyphean nightmare and I want OUT. PLEASE.

Is there ANY GP in Brisbane that doesn't mind referring someone who isn't getting better to a specialist. I just want a doctor who doesn't think me SEEKING HELP for a medical condition is an INSULT to their DOCTORING ABILITIES or whatever.

"TLDR; had bed bugs for the first time during the summer and want advice on whether not I should throw out my upholstered bed frame after not experiencing BB symptoms for 2 months.

I recently had my first experience with bed bugs, it was very minor and, in total, I only saw (and killed) about 5. I had exterminators come, treat the room, I heat treated everything myself and followed every bit of advice I read on the internet. 

The beg bugs were only found on my relatively new upholstered beg frame. There isn’t any obvious marks on the bed frame. The bed frame was expensive and is comfortable.

It’s been 2 months since I’ve seen any bugs or had any bites. I’m about to move into a new apartment and I can’t decide whether or not I should throw out the bed frame and get a new, cheap, basic metal one to avoid any future risk of bed bugs. 

How risky is it to keep the bed frame and bring it with me to my new apartment? 

If there’s been no evidence of bed bugs for the last 2 months is it still possible they will come back or am I in the clear? I would hate to waste a great bed.

1) They only offer it once per day, forcing me to take a sick day (currently work from home).  I have days, others don’t. 

2) My doctor’s office is ten minutes away. The testing center they sent me to is over an hour round trip. I have free time and transportation, others don’t. 

3) They made people STAND OUTSIDE. Apparently the place was understaffed, so the tester was only testing in the vestibule between the two doors.

makes a little of this misery go away and warmed my heart. shit makes your symptoms tolerable by the way. highly suggest if you’re a sick kid like myself. baristas, i agree with sick people not being allowed to come in and order but please agree there is a correct way to get relief (not medicine!) via this drink. <3

"This is a public post from the recent ex-manager of spacebar that likely many locals havent seen and contains information that may influence informed patronage. As a lover of spacebar, I would love to hear the other side of the story, however sharing because numerous former women employees have come forward or shared their similar stories in the past. 

“ [Captain’s Log: 3.27.24. Mission Compromised. Emergency Evacuation Deployed.] I quit spacebar. My crew followed. This is why:

In 2018, I found myself utilizing Spacebar as a late night coffee shop. Basking in neon bathed nostalgia at the bartop became routine while I was running my own business. It was one of my first third spaces. Eventually, I was offered a bartending position. Once I was behind the bar, I fell in love with it. It became my entire focus. As the community knows, I poured all of myself into it for 5 years. My goal was to buy in.

Ultimately, I put up with toxic behavior and abuse for far too long. Why? It was an important part of the community. It was connection. Energy. A safe space. My home. OUR home. Endless blood, sweat, tears, passion, and sacrifice went into that dream.

When you’re looking through rose colored glasses, all of the red flags just look like flags. I hung onto a rope that burned my hands, and was finally forced to let go. I was ride or die in the front seat. Now… I’m car sick.

Here is what I need to highlight:

- There was a toxic element aboard the ship - Our “Captain” succumbed to space madness. Professed his love to me. I told him I wasn’t focused on intimate relationships - Just Spacebar.

- I was pushed out of my job because I didn’t want to date my boss.

- The crew that restarted Spacebar after we crash landed on Kepler 22B was nothing short of incredible. That space is what it is because of the crew and passengers. The connections that were made and the memories that we’ve shared were worth it. 

- If you are a woman, be cautious about working there. There are many other stories like mine/worse.

- You can separate the art from the artist. There is still one good owner who deserves support.

This post is about transparency. “Loose lips sink ships,” I was told. It sounds insane. It is. I have receipts. I lost everything I’ve worked for, and someone who I thought was my friend.

While I’m somewhere between heartbroken and filled with rage, I am so proud of what Zack, my crew, and I accomplished in the past few years. THANK YOU to everyone that supported us on this journey. 

What a wild ride.

"https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/politics-government/2024-04-10/gov-little-i-signed-that-stinkin-library-bill-according-to-report

The Republican war on education and our libraries continues with the full support of our Governor.

Despite all of the terrible flaws that this bill has, it has passed. Any books containing sexual education materials or LGTBQ characters are now legally considered obscene.

Now anyone, even people who do not live in Idaho, can file a complaint about library materials to attempt to have them moved into age restricted(18+) areas. If they dont, the library risks being sued. Libraries that do not have this as an option will either have to completely remove those books or make their libraries open only to adults.

This makes me sick and i'm unbelievably disgusted that our legislators continue to pass bills crafted by the Idaho Family Policy Center, an openly Christian Nationalist organization. This state will be ruined as long as we allow religion to drive our laws and policy.

"I saw this on FB and thought I'd re-post here to alert any new Hampshire dog owners.  The post is from the Milford Veterinary Hospital…..there is a new Canine Respiratory infection going around!! Please read!!!

“We want to alert our clients and community about a health issue facing dogs in our area. For a few weeks now we’ve been seeing an unusually high number of dogs with respiratory infections. Most of these dogs go to various day care facilities, but some do not have a history of high exposure to other dogs. This is not coming from a single daycare or boarding facility, we’ve seen dogs from a variety of places that are getting sick. Nearly all of the sick dogs are vaccinated for bordetella and some are vaccinated for influenza.
    ""Kennel cough"" outbreaks happen from time to time and then they typically run their course after a few weeks, not unlike ""cold and flu season"" in people.
   This time is different.  Most of these dogs are getting VERY sick, requiring aggressive antibiotic therapy, some requiring hospitalization and sadly some deaths have even been reported.
 We’ve been in touch with many neighboring clinics and similar cases have been reported in Amherst, Peterborough, Merrimack and Bedford. Our colleagues in Londonderry to the west, and at Tufts University to the south have NOT been seeing it. The state veterinarian says they have received reports from one other clinic that is also in our area.
    The Veterinary Emergency Center of Manchester (VECM) has been at the center of caring for patients during this epidemic and has been kind enough to share information with us about these cases. In comparing notes, all of the dogs we’ve been testing so far have tested negative for the “usual” suspects such as bordetella, influenza and yes- even coronavirus.  We still do not have an exact diagnosis as to the cause of this illness.
   We urge dog owners in our area to avoid exposing your dog to other dogs at this time, if at all possible. Please seek veterinary care if your dog experiences coughing, runny nose or eyes, sneezing, difficulty breathing or lethargy.
   When seeking veterinary care for a dog that is coughing, sneezing or as has a runny nose please WAIT IN YOUR VEHICLE and call from the car to avoid exposing other dogs in the lobby. 
    We will update you as we learn more. Meanwhile, let's all keep our fingers crossed that this blows over soon do our best to keep our furry friends safe!”"|NewHampshire|2022|True|0

"Chicago,

Do you think that the legalization of drugs (particularly marijuana) would have a massive impact on south side violence?

The reason I ask, is it seems like an obvious (and theoretically easy) solution to a lot of problems we have.

I was reading a vice article (a bit outdated, but imo, still relevant) and it talks about the legalization of marijuana and its effect on Mexican drug cartels.

Article: https://news.vice.com/article/legal-pot-in-the-us-is-crippling-mexican-cartels

Wouldn't the same hold true for all of the gangs we have around Chicago?

I live on the south side. My neighbor across the alley had knocked my cans over and left them in the middle of the alley for a few weeks in a row. 

Last night I saw the guy tying up a bundle of sticks(?) So I took my trash can across the alley and he starts screaming at me that that's his private property and I need to leave my cans on my side of the alley. 

The guy had a pair of scissors, and he lifts the lid of my can and starts cutting my bags open and throwing trash around the alley. Keep in mind my fiancé and I have been sick the last week so he is grabbing loose toilet paper and snot rags out of my trash and throwing them in the alley. 

He then proceeded to try and grill me about how he is always having to pick up trash in his little yard by the alley. After he threw trash everywhere. 

At this point I realize the guys a bit unstable and I just took my can back and waited til later that night when I let my dog out to put the can across the alley.

"My 22 year old step son has schizophrenia, is homeless in Denver and experiencing active psychosis.  He was hospitalized for two weeks but they let him out before he had been on meds very long (he refused at first) and he was/ is still actively psychotic. Because they released him without his medications and he is uninsured, he was unable to pick up his prescriptions without paying hundreds of dollars, so his symptoms steadily went back to baseline within about 3 days.

I tried to get him to voluntarily walk into a crisis center so we could try again to get him stabilized, but he refused because he does not think he is sick or in need of any medications.  He needs help, and medications are the only way to make progress with schizophrenia unfortunately, but unless a first responder takes him in nobody will even see him unless he gives his consent. And in the meantime I am literally terrified that he is going to have a police encounter where he’ll end up dead rather than him getting a ride back to the psych ER.  

When I say he is actively psychotic I am not over stating things. He believes he is thousands of years old and has lived multiple lifetimes. He also believes he has shot himself in the head multiple times in the past and that is how he started over. And he is very angry with various people he has delusions about because he thinks people hurt him in the past or might currently be after him. He’s afraid for his life.  I am very worried he will end up shooting himself for real in order to try and reset himself, although he knows enough not to tell any professionals he speaks to that he is suicidal. 

So, Denver Redditors, any thoughts on how I can get someone to evaluate him while he is in this state of not wanting help?

"For anyone considering moving to the area, or looking for new apartments, I’d avoid The Collins. My 2-star review is continually disappearing from Google (weird). I doubt this violates any of their T&Cs but admittedly haven’t read them.

But here’s the review to consider for anyone potentially wanting to move in:



The apartments are aesthetically nice on the inside. The staff is friendly.

However, the walls are super thin. Most nights you can hear the conversations in the adjacent apartments, and hear their alarms going off on the morning. Last night I was laying in bed and could literally hear my neighbor pushing buttons on their microwave. So you need to be prepared to be on the same sleep schedule as your neighbors.

The gates are open the vast majority of the time, so anyone can drive right in from the busy shopping centers nearby. For example, they’ve been open since Thursday (today is Sunday). I’d venture to say they are open more than they are closed.

The dog washing station has been out of commission all spring save for a few hours one day, then the faucet broke, and it’s been off since. I understand needing to turn it off if there will be a freeze, but not the entire spring. I moved into my apartment in October, and I’ve been able to use the dog washing station twice.

The dog park floods pretty badly when it rains. It appears to be the lowest point on the property, so you can only use it when there hasn’t been any rain, unless you want to have a muddy dog. And if you have a muddy dog, you can’t wash them at the “out of service” dog washing station. So you’ll have to clean your shower and apartment after washing a muddy dog in your apartment.

The mail room is an adventure. There is no organization, just a mess of packages all the time. They’d be really well served with an Amazon locker, otherwise it’s a 20 minute search for packages if you aren’t lucky enough to have yours right out in the open.

There has been a loud beeping throughout the complex for the last three days, making sitting on the balcony unbearable, or just headache inducing having the windows open. Turns out alarms are going off in the Fire Riser Rooms in the buildings. Hopefully these pose no danger as management has done nothing to address this.

The gym is nice, and the maintenance guys are cool.

So 2/5 considering how thin the walls are, the lack of security (the open gates), the apparently ignored alarms ringing through the complex, and a part time dog park/cleaning station."|HuntsvilleAlabama|2022|True|0

"I’ll try to keep I brief. 
We had a gardener booked in to fix the gardens 3 days before we moved out. The gardener’s employee unfortunately got sick and he had to reschedule 8 days after our lease ended. 

We were able to hand the keys back on the day our lease ended. We had scrubbed the house etc etc.the gardener doesn’t need the keys to access the property’s gardens. 

We informed the real estate of the unfortunate circumstances with the gardener (we even tried to get other gardeners to do it but no luck). The real estate then pushed the final inspection back to two days after the gardener’s rescheduled date, even thought inside and outside of the house is perfectly ready to inspect. 

The real estate is now asking for an additional 1.5wks rent to cover from the end lease date to when the rescheduled final inspection is. 

The real estate could have easily done the final inspection with the caveat that the gardens are fixed up at a later date (withholding bond until it is done) but they did not. 
They also have not re-advertised the property for rent. 

Are they allowed to do this? Can I fight this?

FYI: at a glance, there’s nothing about this in the lease."|canberra|2022|True|0
"Hi all,

anyone experiencing being very sick with flu like symptoms and consistently testing negative?

I've seen a lot of Canberrans come down with something awful and it's completely knocked me out for a day of constant soreness"|canberra|2022|True|1
